    Purpose
</h2>
<p>
    The purpose of this document is to support organizations/accounts/projects that must comply with the Act.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>
    Scope
</h2>
<p>
    <b>This guideline applies to:</b>
</p>IBM's support of clients that are publicly registered companies under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), which are those that must comply with The Act. This guideline largely applies to the AMS
organization.<br />
<hr />
<h2>
    Overview
</h2>
<p>
    <b>This guideline includes:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (The Act)
    </li>
    <li>
        Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 (International Standard on Assurance Engagements
        (ISAE) 3402 (formerly SAS 70 Audit) and Agreed upon Procedures (AUP)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Act regulates individuals responsible for corporate governance, disclosure and transparent financial reporting, and
    specifies several requirements ("Sections"), including, but not limited to, the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Management's quarterly certification of their financial results (Section 302)
    </li>
    <li>
        Management's annual assertion that internal controls over financial reporting are effective, attested to by an
        independent auditor (Section 404)
    </li>
    <li>
        Record retention policies (Section 802)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example, IBM may support development or maintenance of financial reporting applications, or the internal controls
    that must be in place to support them, and must support The Act, as appropriate.&nbsp; Each IBM organization must
    establish guidance on how to implement and support.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<h2>
    Details
</h2>
<h2>
    1. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (The Act)
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Act applies to all publicly registered companies under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission (SEC).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If IBM supports development or maintenance of financial reporting applications, or the internal controls that
            must be in place to support them, The Act must be supported, as appropriate.&nbsp; Each IBM organization must
            establish guidance on how to implement and support The Act when supporting a client who must comply with The
            Act.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Section 404 of The Act highlights the significant processes that feed and comprise the financial reporting for
            an organization.&nbsp; For management to make its annual assertion on the effectiveness of its internal
            controls, they are required to document and evaluate all controls that are deemed significant to the financial
            reporting process.&nbsp; If the organization uses a service provider to process transactions, host data, or
            other significant services, management will look to the service organization for information on the design and
            operating effectiveness of the service organization's controls.&nbsp; Management will either need to conduct an
            evaluation of the service organization's controls, or may obtain a&nbsp;SSAE No.&nbsp;16 service auditor's
            report from the service organization, to gain an understanding of the service organization's controls.&nbsp;
            Refer to the SSAE 16 Audit section below for additional information.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    2. SSAE 16, ISAE 3402 (formerly SAS 70 Audit) and AUP
</h2>
<p>
    In December 2009 the Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) issued its International Standard on Assurance Engagements
    (ISAE) No. 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization. Shortly thereafter, the AICPA, as part of its
    efforts to converge U.S. standards with those of the IAASB issued the Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No.
    16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization and the International Auditing requirements. Following are some
    highlights of this change:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        SSAE 16 (and ISAE 3402) replaces SAS 70 as the standard for reporting on controls by a provider of outsources
        services for reports with periods ending on or after June 15, 2011.
    </li>
    <li>
        There will continue to be the distinction between Type I (opinion on design only) and Type II (opinion on both
        design and operating effectiveness) audits under the new standards. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The impact of the new standards on service organizations (IBM) and user organizations (our clients) will
                not be significant except that the service provider (IBM) has to include a written assertion in the audit
                report.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        There will generally be no change from the AMS SAS 70 in terms of timing, scope, testing or report-out.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Adoption of the new standards should not increase the internal work effort associated with this controls audit, with
    perhaps some additional testing required to support management's assertion.
</p>
<p>
    For AMS accounts, our service auditor, PwC, will primarily perform Control Audits under SSAE 16.
</p>
<p>
    There are a limited number of client engagements that currently require an SSAE 16 (SAS 70), (about 10) on a worldwide
    basis. All SSAEs are client specific within AMS. The Control Objectives tested within an SSAE 16 are generally fairly
    consistent across engagements, but the Control Activities which are relied upon to indicate compliance with the control
    activities are client specific. This means that the control activities are unique across each engagement.
</p>
<p>
    The requirement to perform an SSAE 16 or AUP (Agreed upon procedures) continues to be a contractually driven
    requirement, and the procedures are performed on a client specific basis. The SSAE is different from an AUP in that the
    SSAE 16 expresses an opinion on the design and operating effectiveness of controls. The AUP does not express an
    opinion, but only reports on the projects compliance with the Control activities included in the AUP test script noting
    in a very factual manner if there were any defects found in the test results.
</p>
<p>
    If a client expresses an interest in having IBM perform an SSAE 16/SAS 70/AUP in fulfillment of a contractual
    commitment, the PE/DPE/PM should immediately contact the AMS BC Global Lead and the IOT focal for SSAE 16/SAS 70. The
    preparation effort for an SSAE 16/AUP is frequently 6 to 9 months, and takes one or more full time people to coordinate
    the preparation by the delivery team. The delivery team will also have substantial preparation time. There will also be
    required internal project team testing of standard evidential material to validate the delivery compliance with
    required, documentable evidence. In addition there will be a readiness review by PWC in Advance of the audit period.
    Both types of testing are followed by remediation activities.
</p>
<p>
    Part of the preparation for an SSAE 16, the engagement teams should perform an internal readiness assessment. The
    general areas of focus in such an internal readiness assessment are dictated by the control objectives and activities
    described in the Contract, SOW, or supporting documentation. The ISAE questionnaire may be used to&nbsp;guide
    organizations to map&nbsp;their current standard processes and methods to support the compliance&nbsp;with the
    "standard" control objectives and activities, and can help guide the organization to support this compliance within
    their established processes and methods. Please note, however, that this questionnaire must be modified to reflect the
    actual control objectives and Control activities agreed to with the specific client.
</p>
<p>
    Organizations that may need to be prepared for an SSAE 16 audit can link to the SSAE 16 Questionnaire with Responses.
    This questionnaire contains the following for each control point:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Control Activity
    </li>
    <li>
        Audit Question
    </li>
    <li>
        Response Guidance
    </li>
    <li>
        Response References
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After all preparation is complete, and at least one month in advance of the fieldwork for the audit, the engagement
    team is required to present a petition to the GTS/AMS External Service Organization Reporting Steering committee, where
    their preparation efforts are reviewed. If the engagement team is not well prepared, the petition will be denied until
    they are prepared or unless they obtain approval to proceed from the Senior VP AMS.
