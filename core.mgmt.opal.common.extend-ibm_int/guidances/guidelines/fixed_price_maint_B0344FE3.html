<h2>
    Details
</h2>
<h2>
    1. Engagement guideline details
</h2>
<p>
    In the engagement phase, IBM and the client agree on the scope of services including requirements, the application
    portfolio to be maintained, and the general activities that will be performed during delivery to provide the
    agreed-upon services.
</p>
<p>
    The topics in this section include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Qualifying the Deal
    </li>
    <li>
        Establishing the Pricing Methodology

        Evaluating the Price as the Contract Proceeds
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    1.1 Qualifying the deal
</h2>
<p>
    Before proposing a fixed price maintenance option, the engagement team needs to review the characteristics that make a
    deal a candidate for this delivery option:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        "Break-fix" and production support maintenance only<br />
        Is the client looking for the kind of services that we group under fixed price maintenance?
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Clear requirements with baseline<br />
        Do we understand the client requirements and the maintenance platform from which we are&nbsp;starting?&nbsp; Fixed
        price works best when we know the current level of effort and cost to maintain the client's application portfolio.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Stringent change management<br />
        Will we be able to manage change requests (both to the portfolio and at the application level) with the degree of
        rigor required to make a fixed price agreement viable?&nbsp; If not, it may be best to propose a time and materials
        contract.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        High comfort level with estimates<br />
        Are we confident that the estimates for the maintenance work are reasonably accurate?&nbsp; If not, we may want to
        propose an initial phase that uses a bounded fixed price or time and materials to build a baseline for the fixed
        price phase.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Good risk assessment with complete mitigation/containment plans as part of Fixed Price Maintenance estimate<br />
        Since IBM assumes much of the risk with a fixed price agreement, it is important that we include strong risk
        management in our project planning.&nbsp; The GS Risk tool provides guidance that we need (and EMEA experience has
        shown that it adequately covers fixed price maintenance contracts).
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Level of client AD/M sophistication is known and appropriate<br />
        Fixed price maintenance contracts can be attractive where there is significant opportunity to increase the maturity
        of the application maintenance processes as we assume responsibility for maintenance of the client's application
        portfolio.&nbsp; Thus, clients at SEI CMM levels 1 or 2 are good candidates for Fixed Price Maintenance contracts.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Critical mass achieved (approximately 20 headcount)<br />
        To enable the resource sharing and other economies of scale that make fixed price maintenance a win-win option, the
        contract has to be large enough.&nbsp; An estimated work effort requiring fewer than 20 headcount is probably too
        small.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    1.2 Establishing the pricing methodology
</h2>
<p>
    If, following qualification, Fixed Price Maintenance is an attractive pricing option for the deal, the engagement team
    needs to determine the pricing parameters. The methodology described in this section uses input from the client and
    from IBM to categorize applications into nine major groups. Different pricing factors are applied to each group to
    determine the overall fixed price.
</p>
<h2>
    1.2.1 Costing the solution and pricing the deal
</h2>
<p>
    Before a fixed price can be determined, the cost of the solution is determined. The same tools and methods are used to
    cost a fixed price maintenance contract and a time and materials maintenance contract, since the amount of work that
    needs to be done is the same.
</p>
<p>
    Different service levels may be associated with each of the nine different application groups, and this may affect the
    cost to deliver the solution. Where the solution lends itself to shared services, we can factor this in to the cost as
    well.
</p>
<p>
    The cost to IBM to deliver the required services becomes a key input to the pricing model.
</p>
<h2>
    1.2.2 Pricing model
</h2>
<p>
    The pricing model uses a two-dimensional view of the application portfolio to partition it into nine application
    groups.
</p>
<p>
    Based on the characteristics of the group, each of the nine application groups is assigned a valuation factor that is
    used in setting the price.&nbsp; The greater the strategic importance, the complexity, or the defect rate, the greater
    the valuation factor, as these characteristics translate directly into work effort and business value of the services
    provided.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Groups may also have different service levels associated, affecting both pricing and delivery.&nbsp; As needed,
    applications within each group can be further broken down into logical subgroups, for example, by source language,
    platform or business process.&nbsp; It is very likely that subgroups will be used when determining how and by whom
    services will be delivered.
</p>
<p>
    The following is a pictorial view of the pricing model.&nbsp; The Y-axis (?) depicts the client view of the application
    value to the business; the X-axis (?) depicts the IBM view of the application maintenance profile.&nbsp; Relative
    pricing values increase along each axis, and the application group in the upper right hand corner will typically have
    the highest pricing factor, while the application group in the lower left corner will typically have the lowest pricing
    factor.
</p>

</p>
<h2>
    1.3 Partitioning the portfolio
</h2>
<p>
    The client classifies the applications in the portfolio according to their strategic importance, assigning each to one
    of three categories. For ease of reference, we label these categories Gold, Silver and Bronze.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Gold:</b> The application is considered mission-critical, of strategic importance, and most likely expected to be
    around for some time.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Silver:</b> The application is of average importance to the business and provides significant business value.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Bronze:</b> The application is low-value, non-strategic, or an about-to-be sunset tool.
</p>
<p>
    The IBM team, with input from the client, classifies each application according to the expected maintenance effort
    required.&nbsp; Again, there are three categories: Low, Medium, and High.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Low:</b>&nbsp; The application is relatively simple with a low known or expected defect rate.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Medium:</b> The application is of average complexity and has a low to moderate defect rate.
</p>
<p>
    <b>High:</b>&nbsp; The application is highly complex and/or exhibits a high defect rate.
</p>
<p>
    After all applications have been categorized, they are collected into nine groups (Gold-High, Gold-Medium, Gold-Low,
    Silver-High, Silver-Medium, Silver-Low, Bronze-High, Bronze-Medium, Bronze-Low) based on the values assigned.&nbsp; For
    some clients, there will be applications in all nine groups; for others, the applications may cluster into one or two
    groups.
</p>
<h2>
    1.4 Assigning the valuation factors
</h2>
<p>
    For fixed price maintenance, different valuation factors are assigned for each of the nine groups, as each group has a
    different risk associated with it. IBM teams involved in pricing and managing the portfolio should refer to their
    complete pricing guidance.
</p>
<h2>
    1.5 Pricing the portfolio
</h2>
<p>
    IBM teams involved in pricing the portfolio should refer to their complete pricing guidance.
</p>
<p>
    <img border="0" alt="Informational Reference" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/icon-information-blue.gif" width="12"     height="12" />&nbsp;Refer to the IBM Global Services Finance and Planning website for available Financial Analyst
    Handbooks, to aid IBM Global Services Pricers in fulfilling their responsibilities (preliminary registration and
    intranet password may be required).
</p>
<h2>
    1.6 Managing changes in the portfolio
</h2>
<p>
    Typically, the application portfolio will change composition over time. The client will add applications, delete
    applications and replace applications with newer versions. Any of these changes may require an adjustment to the
    pricing.
</p>
<p>
    If possible, define a fixed schedule for reviewing and updating the portfolio, for example, quarterly or semi-annual
    updates with an annual portfolio rebalancing.&nbsp; This will allow changes to be collected and batched for analysis
    and pricing, giving the maximum opportunity to provide a cost effective solution that brings value to the client and
    IBM alike.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Determine whether the regular reviews will result in a rebalancing of the entire portfolio, or whether they will simply
    cover additions and deletions to existing application groups.&nbsp; When the portfolio is rebalanced, the client and
    IBM update the application classifications for all applications in the portfolio and a new fixed price is computed
    across the entire portfolio.&nbsp; When the regular updates cover only application additions, deletions, or minor
    enhancements, there is no rebalancing; only the new applications are classified and the price is simply adjusted based
    on the added or removed applications.
</p>
<h2>
    1.6.1 Adding or removing application groups
</h2>
<p>
    If the original classification of the application portfolio resulted in a need for fewer than nine application groups,
    some groups may be empty. There is then no cost or price associated with the empty groups. There is no need to add or
    remove application groups. On the other hand, each group may be subdivided into two or more subgroups for ease of
    associating the applications with the delivery plan.
</p>
<h2>
    1.6.2 Updating application groups
</h2>
<p>
    It is a relatively straightforward procedure to update the application groups when the client adjusts the portfolio for
    which we are providing fixed price maintenance services.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Adding applications to a group<br />
        When an application is added to a group, the price is recalculated to include the application.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deleting applications from a group<br />
        When an application is deleted from a group, the price is recalculated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Replacing applications in a group<br />
        There needs to be a clear understanding between IBM and the client as to what constitutes a major new release, and
        what is merely a minor application enhancement.&nbsp; Typically, minor application enhancements do not result in a
        change in the maintenance price; major new releases may result in a price adjustment.<br />
        If a major new release is implemented, the application will be reclassified.&nbsp; In many cases, the maintenance
        effort will be judged to increase, as new releases tend to have more defects than stable, mature releases.&nbsp;
        New releases often add significant function, also increasing the amount of maintenance effort required.&nbsp;
        Sometimes, however, new releases improve the maintainability of the application and reduce the required maintenance
        effort.
    </li>
    <li>
        Moving applications from one group to another<br />
        When an application is reclassified into another group, then the prices for the source and target application
        groups must be recalculated.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    1.7 Evaluating the price as the contract proceeds
</h2>
<p>
    It is important to review the accuracy of the pricing as the deal is executed over time to ensure IBM is achieving the
    profitability goals it set. A "lessons learned" exercise at regular intervals should focus on the parameters you
    selected to learn which worked well and which require refinement. In particular, did you capture costs realistically
    and did you identify appropriate categories for the applications in the portfolio?
</p>
<h2>
    2. Delivery guideline details
</h2>
<p>
    Once the contract has been signed, it is time for Delivery to begin providing fixed price maintenance services.
</p>
<p>
    There are some best practices to follow when delivering services against a fixed price maintenance contract.&nbsp;
    Where a best practice exists, it is summarized here or a reference is made to its full description elsewhere.&nbsp;
    Rather than changing the way services are provided, special emphasis is put on certain areas, such as change control,
    in order to meet the service level and profitability objectives of the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Fixed Price Maintenance projects are subject to appropriate levels of project management.&nbsp; This document is
    intended to provide advice and guidance to practitioners on what procedures or practices may differ in some respect for
    a Fixed Price Maintenance effort, assuming that the reader is already familiar with standard delivery practices and
    procedures.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Guidance to the Delivery teams during the Transition and Steady-State phases of the deal is provided for each of the
    following activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Requirements Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Service Levels
    </li>
    <li>
        Problem Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Portfolio Management

    <li>
        Change Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Estimating
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    2.1 Requirements management
</h2>
<h2>
    2.1.1 Transition phase
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        IBM application support teams and business application support teams must have a common understanding of when a
        defect will be investigated under Fixed Price Maintenance, for example, non-conformance to baseline requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Baseline Requirements that clearly define how the application functions are essential. If these requirements do not
        exist to the required level of detail, they must be created prior to commencing a Fixed Price Maintenance
        agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Baseline Interface Requirements that clearly define the functionality of data transfer between the two applications
        are also essential.&nbsp; If these requirements do not exist to the required level of detail, they have to be
        created prior to commencing a Fixed Price Maintenance agreement.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    2.1.2 Steady-State phase
</h2>
<p>
    To determine whether a problem reported by the business is a defect that should be resolved under Fixed Price
    Maintenance, compare the Baseline Requirements against how the application is functioning.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If there is a discrepancy between the way the application is functioning and the baseline requirements, then the
        problem is a defect and should be resolved under Fixed Price Maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the application were functioning as defined in the baseline requirements, then the problem would need to be
        fixed as part of an enhancement and the appropriate baseline requirements updated.
    </li>
    <li>
        No updates would be expected to the baseline requirements documentation for Fixed Price Maintenance activity except
        to provide an increased level of clarity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ongoing education on how to handle suspected requirement defects will be required as new personnel are assigned to
        the application support team.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    2.2 Service levels
</h2>
<h2>
    2.2.1 Transition phase
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Know what service levels exist as part of the contract: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Know if any of the service levels have financial penalties associated with them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Know if there are any performance requirements of the application.
            </li>
            <li>
                Understand the application support personnel coverage.&nbsp; If coverage is less than one FTE, the
                appropriate prioritization and resource availability must be in place.&nbsp; Otherwise, challenges may
                arise when trying to meet service levels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Establish measurements of how the application support is performing against all service levels.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Manage to the committed service levels: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Prior to commencing a Fixed Price Maintenance contract, identify activities that need to be performed in

            <li>
                Priority is given to defects that will affect the service level target.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ongoing education is given to the IBM application support team on the service levels and processes to

    Appendix A. Defining Fixed Price Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
    The application management services that are typically covered under the Fixed Price Maintenance pricing option include
    defect repair or break-fix services, and production support or maintenance services for ongoing support.
</p>
<h2>
    Break-fix or defect repair
</h2>
<p>
    Application maintenance for break-fix activity is defined as the minimum activity required to keep an application
    running <b>in its current functional scope</b>. It includes actions taken to identify and repair application defects
    and failures when applications fail to conform to specifications for the application's software.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the level of work associated with defect repair will be dependent on the classification of the application,
    as described under the 'Establishing the pricing methodology' section of this document.
</p>
<h2>
    Production support or maintenance for ongoing support
</h2>
<p>
    Application maintenance for ongoing or production support comprises the day-to-day activities needed to support a
    system or client.&nbsp; The support provided does not necessitate any correction or modification to application
    software.
</p>
<p>
    Production support activities that can be included in the scope of the fixed price maintenance pricing option are those
    that exhibit predictable workloads and bounded scope.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The following table summarizes activities normally included in Production Support.&nbsp; The table is grouped into
    three sections:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Usually suitable for fixed price
    </li>
    <li>
        Sometimes suitable for fixed price
    </li>
    <li>
        Typically not suitable for fixed price
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>
    Applications
</h2>
<p>
    An application is within the scope of the Fixed Price Maintenance agreement if it is listed in the portfolio of
    applications agreed to by IBM and the client.
</p>
<h2>
    Enhancements or development are NOT included
</h2>
<p>
    The activities included under fixed price maintenance should never include application enhancements or application
    development, whether small or large.
</p>
<h2>
    Appendix B. Rationale for offering a fixed price maintenance delivery option
</h2>
<p>
    Analysts note that fixed price contracts are the better option because they enable providers to capture value that
    their clients cannot. Value is captured by carefully defining how much of the client's process they will manage, by
    using fixed price contracts where possible, and by minimizing the amount of customization they do. When successful,
    providers realize both economies of scale and economies of skill, using innovations developed while serving one client
    in a codified, repeatable way for other client.
</p>
<p>
    Fixed Price Maintenance provides a value proposition that is attractive to both the client and the supplier of
    services. For the client, fixed price offers predictable, guaranteed maintenance costs with good access to skills. In
    addition, risk is shifted to the services supplier, as the supplier carries the cost of quality, pays if the defect
    rate increases, and has an incentive to improve productivity, as greater productivity leads to a more profitable
    contract. IBM offers fixed price because it allow us to manage a predictable workload across application groupings, to
    use a shared resource model to gain efficiencies at non-peak times, and to have a potentially higher reward for a
    potentially higher (but quite unlikely) risk.
