    Purpose
</h2>
<p>
    <b>Use this guideline to:</b>
</p>
<p>
    Identify and understand the following in support of a Life Sciences Organization client:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Life Sciences Organization requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Work products in IBM Unified Method Framework (The Method) Delivery Processes that support these requirements
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> The focus of these Life Sciences requirements is on GxP regulations (GxP = Good Practices, where the x
    stands for M (Manufacturing), C (Clinical) or L (Laboratory)).&nbsp;

                A life sciences organization validation plan must be created, and must describe all required validation
                activities together with assigned responsibilities, priorities and timing for applications or systems that
                are GxP relevant. The validation plan requires the creation of protocols that establish a structured series
                of formal checks to verify that each stage of the validation process has been properly completed. The
                protocols that are relevant here are: Design Qualification (DQ), Installation Qualification (IQ),
                Operational Qualification (OQ) and Performance Qualification (PQ).&nbsp; Execution of this validation plan
                will positively prove the application or system exactly matches the design specifications (including
                compliance requirements).

                    The life sciences organization validation plan may reference other plans, such as the project quality
                    plan, project management system summary.&nbsp; All plans must be consistent and complementary in
                    content.&nbsp; For example, all plans for an application must be consistent with each other and not
                    contain any contradictory requirements.&nbsp; Quality is a superset of compliance and to achieve full
                    compliance, quality must be built into the development and operation of the application.&nbsp;

                    QA MUST be separate (have separate reporting lines) from those who own, operate, or perform work on the
                    system.&nbsp; The client may play some or all of the roles associated with Quality, and although an IBM
                    SME is preferred to play this QA role, it is desirable for the client to be involved.&nbsp;The IBM QA
                    role is to ensure that the work product IBM is required to produce is of adequate quality and meets any
                    applicable regulatory requirements, including the client's interpretation of the regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an IBM Quality Assurance Group plays this role, they must incorporate regulatory compliance into
                    their QA activities.&nbsp;Refer to the Quality Assurance section of the&nbsp;OPAL Policy&nbsp;Guideline
                    for additional information on IBM Quality Assurance.

                    For process assurance activities, the process assurance review report - project and the process
                    assurance review report - organization&nbsp;can be used&nbsp;to cover regulatory compliance.

                    perspective, even though 'operations' may be out-of-scope and handled by another organization or tower

                All in-scope activities and details associated with operational controls must be identified, planned, and
                managed.&nbsp; The use of the Method, following the standards outlined in section 2&nbsp;IBM Unified Method
                Framework (The Method) Tailoring, is also mandatory to cover this.&nbsp; For example, requirements may be
                included in the requirements-gathering process for creating the documentation that will be used for
                operating a system, even though operations may be out-of-scope and handled by another organization or tower
                (such as a SDC).
