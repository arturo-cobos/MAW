<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The WBS is a detailed, hierarchical representation of the project expressed in terms of work that ultimately forms the
basis of the project schedules. Although the WBS is a precursor to the project schedules, it differs from the schedules
because start and end dates are not defined. Therefore, dependencies and overlaps are not always evident from viewing the
WBS.<br />
<br />
The WBS is an interim work product in the scheduling process and may eventually be fully incorporated into the project
schedules.<br />
<br />
A WBS is made up of single units of work, or work elements, which must: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Represent a discrete package of work, other resources and cost
    </li>
    <li>
        Deliver a distinct, identifiable product or result
    </li>
    <li>
        Have definitive, verifiable completion criteria
    </li>
    <li>
        Be clearly assignable as the sole responsibility of a single party, organizational unit or individual
    </li>
</ul>A WBS is commonly represented in either a tree structure or an indented list; however the presentation format of the
WBS is not usually mandated. The working WBS can be created, within a word processor ("Outline" mode is useful), or within
a scheduling tool (common tools are MS Project or Rational Portfolio Manager (RPM)).<br />
<br />
Among the descending levels of composition that are represented in a WBS, those at the top represent a partition into
broad, or "high-level", activity groups. Therefore, the term "high-level WBS" addresses that part of a WBS which represents
the first levels of decomposition. The hierarchy has as many levels as are required to structure the work. Top-level
activities are broken down into second level activities that in turn are broken down into third level activities and so
on.<br />
<br />
The term "work unit" is a generic term used to designate any item (phase, activity, or task), at any level in the
WBS.<br />
<br />
Note that, although they can be both represented by hierarchical lists, the WBS and the Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
are two different things. The PBS is a decomposition of the solution into components and elements that the project will
make, reuse, or buy; while the WBS shows all the activities that the project team performs.<br />

<p>
    The WBS usually comprises three levels, which represent a detailed breakdown of the work in a project. They are created
    and used to control, and provide visibility into the project at an appropriate level for various levels of management.
    Together the three levels constitute the WBS for a project:<br />
    Level 1 list of phases<br />
    Level 2 list of activities<br />
    Level 3 list of tasks
</p>
<p>
    The levels are created and used to control, and provide visibility into the project at an appropriate level for various
    levels of management. Together the three levels constitute the WBS for a project. For more information, see the Content
    section below.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the WBS is to define and structure all the activities that the project team must complete and so to
    provide a basis upon which the work can be scheduled. Prerequisites for completing a WBS are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Requirements are defined and understood
    </li>
    <li>
        A complete list of the major deliverables for the project exists
    </li>
    <li>
        A preliminary decomposition of deliverables into components has been created.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Impact of not having this work product</b><br />
    Without a WBS, the project team does not have a clear definition of the work that it is required to carry out.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Reasons for not needing this work product</b><br />
    The WBS is a mandatory project management work product.
</p>
<p>
    The WBS is developed by analysis of two main sources: the technical method being used and possibly the network diagram
    resulting from the solution Product Breakdown Structure.<br />
    <br />
    There are many other activities, such as project management activities, which may be identified and then decomposed as
    necessary, largely by applying experience and project management processes.<br />
    <br />
    At the bottom of the hierarchy, the activities are small enough to be organized into work units and scheduled<br />
    <br />
    The WBS is created during Project Shaping (Defining and Planning) and may be extended during Project Startup and,
    perhaps, at later stages in the project.<br />
    <br />
    Although it can be produced manually in a spreadsheet or another type of document, the WBS is usually documented using
    project management software (such as MS Project or Rational Portfolio Manager (RPM).<br />
    <br />
    When developing the WBS, follow these general rules:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Push responsibility down the hierarchy
    </li>
    <li>
        Always document a work element, with its completion criteria, before all its supporting tasks at the next level
        down are documented
    </li>
    <li>
        If the number of supporting tasks at the next level down is so large as to inhibit control and timely completion,
        reassess the size of the parent work element
    </li>
    <li>
        A work element at the lowest level should have a maximum duration of five working days (or 40 hours)
    </li>
    <li>
        Never try to expand the WBS more than one level below what is currently documented
    </li>
    <li>
        Always review with the individual responsible for the next higher level of work element
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Preparing for building the WBS
</h3>
<p>
    Understand the major milestones for the project, which are usually associated with turnover of the project's
    deliverables. Generally these are customer-owned milestones that can be changed only through Change Management.<br />
    <br />
    To develop a list of deliverables you should:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Begin as soon as possible in the life of the project
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify all (major) contractual deliverables
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop from the top down
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Understand what is available to help you. Ask yourself these questions:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What project documentation is available that will assist in development of the WBS?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does a WBS already exist for this project?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does a Method Execution Template exist that supports this project?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are there any suitable models from similar projects?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the major deliverables?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who will be the key people doing the work?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the availability of these people to support the development of the WBS?
    </li>
    <li>
        How will the WBS be maintained and by whom?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Level 1 list of phases
</h3>Level 1 expands the level 1 list of deliverables into more detail. It depicts the end-to-end plan for delivering the
major deliverables for each project. It is often used specifically to depict the high level phases of the development
lifecycle that will be used to create the major deliverables associated with level 1. To develop the level 1 list of phases
you should: 
<ul>
    <li>
        At project start-up, or earlier, generate the WBS down to level 2
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that every deliverable listed has its own separate work element
    </li>
    <li>
        Concentrate on identifying all areas of work
    </li>
    <li>
        Review jointly and rigorously against the rules for work elements
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask yourself these questions: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Can the progress of each phase be measured?
            </li>
            <li>
                Have the methodology and tools to be used in the development of the solution been selected?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Level 2 list of activities
</h3>Level 2 contains sufficient detail to support the planning and managing of the level 1 phases. Level 2 depicts the
activities required to complete each of the level 1 phases, and will depend on the type of project and the development
environment. To develop the level 2 list of activities you should: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Avoid developing detail before it is needed
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that each work element has a provable result
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask yourself these questions: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Can each activity be assigned to one individual or functional group?
            </li>
            <li>
                Can the progress of each activity be measured?
            </li>
            <li>
                Can the position of each activity relative to the total project be clearly identified?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do you have unique activities for each product required?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there any duplication of work?
            </li>
            <li>
                On longer projects it is generally not appropriate to prepare detailed lists of activities at level 2 more
                than a few months ahead, as much effort can be lost if changes to level 1 require re-planning at lower
                levels.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    On longer projects it is generally not appropriate to prepare detailed lists of activities at level 2 more than a few
    months ahead, as much effort can be lost if changes to level 1 require re-planning at lower levels.
</p>
<h3>
    Level 3 list of tasks
</h3>The Level 3 list of tasks contains additional detail to support the level 2 list of activities. Each activity that is
shown on level 2 is decomposed into its component tasks. Project Managers and Team Members use Level 3 to identify and
document the level of detail necessary to ensure that the level 3 activities can be successfully completed once they are
scheduled and resource assigned. Once the task list is complete, then create the schedule and assign resources for the
project. The level 3 tasks should be created at a level that will enable scheduling and resource assignment based on the
following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        A maximum duration of five working days (40 hours)
    </li>
    <li>
        A single person or group responsible for completion
    </li>
    <li>
        At least 90% of dependencies among tasks which are 'start-to-finish'
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is generally not appropriate to prepare detailed lists of tasks at level 3 more than a few weeks ahead. On smaller
    projects, level 2 activities may meet the requirements of level 3, and this further breakdown may not be required at
    all. In developing the level 3 list of tasks, use the same hints as for level 2.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Final thoughts
</h3>Ask yourself these questions: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Have the right people been involved?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the level of detail right, allowing planning and control to be exercised by individual managers as appropriate?
    </li>
    <li>
        Has the WBS been tested for omissions?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the WBS allow for easy flow of information upwards?
    </li>
    <li>
        Has the WBS been agreed to?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Key Considerations
</h3>
<h3>
    Validation and verification
</h3>The accuracy and completeness of the WBS is validated by inspection and by ensuring its consistency with the other
project management plans, in particular, the Product Breakdown Structure and the Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS).</td>
