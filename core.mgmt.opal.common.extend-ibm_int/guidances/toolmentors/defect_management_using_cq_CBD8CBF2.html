    <strong>1 Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This document provides guidance how IBM Rational ClearQuest is used to support Defect Management Procedure (IMSP520) in
    accordance with the OnDemand Process Asset Library (OPAL). This document may serve as a template for creating a
    tailored procedure or guideline.
</p>
<p>
    The intent of this guidance is to provide sufficient direction on how IBM Rational ClearQuest is used on a project to
    support Defect Management, so that there are no ambiguities about the process and the team training can be concise.
</p>
<p>
    This document does not replace the procedure and does not cover all of the steps defined in the procedure. To fully
    understand this document, it should be read in conjuntion with the procedure.
</p>
<p>
    Refer to the procedure and the associated references described in OPAL for details on the tasks, steps and techniques
    for performing this procedure. In particular, you should be aware that the procedure may contain additional steps that
    take place outside of ClearQuest and are not duplicated here.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2 Scope</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The guidance assumes a basic understanding of how to use IBM Rational ClearQuest and is not intended to be training
    material. Detailed training on the use of IBM Rational ClearQuest can be found by selecting Education from the <a href="http://ams1.sby.ibm.com/igsdf/tools_mgmt.nsf/Content/RATSW_GetStart_Home"><u>GBS Rational Lifecycle Tools
    Enablement</u></a> page.<br />
    <br />
    The process documented is dependant upon the use of the tailored ClearQuest Schema produced by the Global Services
    Rational Adoption Program (GSRAP) team.
</p>
<p>
    The current customized schema has the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">

    <em>3.1 The workflow (defect's lifecycle)</em>
</p>
<p class="BodyText">
    The following state transition diagram shows the lifecycle of a defect within ClearQuest. States are shown by boxes;
    Actions are shown by the connecting arrows. Each action (arrow) has a legend with the format <i>[ActionName, Role]</i>
    where: <i>ActionName</i> is the name of the action and <i>Role</i> is the role with the permissions to execute the
    action.<br />

    <br />
    The normal lifecycle of a defect is shown through the centre of the diagram from left to right: <b>Raised</b> through
    <b>Closed</b>. Other states are exceptional.<br />
    The following table defines each of these states.

    <em>3.2 IBM Rational ClearQuest usage</em>
</p>
<p>
    ClearQuest may be accessed either directly via the ClearQuest Client, or via the web interface ClearQuest Web. Due to
    performance reasons the recommended interface -especially for hosted environments- is the ClearQuest Web, so all the
    actions described in this document refer to this interface. If using the ClearQuest client similar actions are
    available and a table mapping these actions between both interfaces is provided below.<br />
    Once connected to ClearQuest, there are three kinds of action that may be performed to a defect- changes to the content
    of the defect's fields, changes to the state of the defect (as shown in the diagram above), and the assigning of the
    defect to a new owner. These actions are performed in the following ways.

    A detailed description of each field is contained in the field's help provided within ClearQuest.
</p>
<p>
    Other kind of action that may be performed using ClearQuest and that will be very useful for you is to search the
    defects' database (defects' log) using public or personal queries: the first ones -"public queries"- are available to
    the whole team while the personal queries are private and available only for the creator. As you can write your own
    queries you can search defects with specific criteria and create your own layout.<br />
    In order to learn more about how to perform these actions and others related to ClearQuest, the solution has additional
    documents and/or viewlets that will help you with this job.

    <em>3.5 Evidence of Conformance to Defect Management Procedure</em>
</p>
<p>
    This section describes the features built-in to the ClearQuest schema to provide evidence for conformance to the Defect
    Management Procedure (IMSP520).
</p>
<p class="BodyText">
    1. Each identified defect is represented by a defect record in ClearQuest.
</p>
<p class="BodyText">
    2. The query Defect Log (APP414) contains the information in the Defect Log (APP 414) or in the Defect Management
    Documentation (DCD 325). Using this query, it is not necessary to maintain a separate defect log as the query can be
    run on demand.
</p>
<p class="BodyText">
    3. Defect metrics can be collected from the individual defect records in ClearQuest or analyzed by building queries and
    charts as required. This information can be exported for inclusion in a separate database (for example ESSBASE) if
    required.<br class="BodyText" />

<h2>
    Step <a>1 Identify, raise and log defect</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    <a>1.1 Submit a defect</a><br />
</h3><br />
When a defect has been identified, a defect record must be raised in ClearQuest. This will be carried out by whoever finds
the defect (henceforth, the Submitter). <br />
Connect to ClearQuest Web, using the instructions supplied by the deployment team. Using the options at the top of the
ClearQuest Web interface select <b>New:</b> <b>Defect</b> and click the <b>Go</b> button. A Defect submission form will be
displayed. <br />
<img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_DefectSubmissionForm.JPG" width="600" height="470" /> <br />
<br />
<br />
ClearQuest will automatically fill some fields like <b>Defect ID</b>, <b>Date Raised</b>, <b>Originator (Submitter)</b> and
<b>Status</b>. Fill in all mandatory fields and any optional fields that you feel may aid in resolution. After completing
all the required fields, save the form. Now the defect is identified and logged in ClearQuest and its status is
<b>Raised</b>. 
<div>
    <div>
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_RaisedDefect.JPG" width="600" height="470" /><br />
    </div>
    <div>
        The Project Manager will be sent an e-mail telling that a new defect has been raised.<br />
        The decision regarding if the defect is valid or not is made in the following step.<br />
    </div>
    <div>
        <a>1.2 Cancel a defect</a><br />
        <br />
        If after raising a new defect in ClearQuest the Submitter considers the defect should not be submitted he/she can
        cancel it before the Project Manager makes any analysis on it. In ClearQuest select
        <b>ChangeState.Cancel</b>.<br />
        <img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_OptionForCancellingDefect.JPG" width="600" height="470" /><br />
        <br />
        Optionally the reason or comments regarding this action can be added into the Actions/Comments field.
    </div>
    <div>
        <br />
        <img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_AddingCommentsWhenCancelling.JPG" width="600" height="470" /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Then the form should be saved. The defect's status is now <b>Cancelled.</b><br />
        The Project Manager will be sent an e-mail telling that the defect has been cancelled.
    </div>
</div>
<h2>
    <a>Step 2 Accept defect and assign responsibility</a>
</h2>Once a defect has been submitted, a decision must be made upon whether it is valid. 
<h3>
    <a>2.1 Set defect as Duplicate</a>
</h3>
<p>
    If there is an existing (reported) defect that encompasses some or all of the new defect's symptoms, the Project
    Manager marks the new defect as Duplicate. In ClearQuest select <b>Duplicate</b>. At this moment you will be asked to
    "Enter the Entity Id".
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_SetDefectAsDuplicate.JPG" width="600" height="470" />&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    Complete this field with the <b>Defect ID</b> value automatically set by ClearQuest to the defect to which the new one
    relates to and click OK. Save the form after completing the defect's information with your desired comments in the
    <b>Actions/Comments</b> field.<br />
    The defect's status is now <b>Duplicate.</b><br />
    Note that all defects which are in status <b>Raised</b> or <b>Deferred</b> can be set as duplicate at any time.
</p>
<h3>
    <a>2.2 Set defect as Rejected (invalid defect)</a>
</h3>A defect can be considered invalid for many reasons like: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">
            It is the result of a risk occurrence, change or issue.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">
            It was caused by testing errors or omissions

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">
            It was raised as the result of a user misunderstanding, etc.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">
    If the defect is considered to be invalid it is rejected. In ClearQuest select <b>ChangeState.Reject</b> and complete
    at least the following field:
</p>
<p class="BodyText">
    <b>Resolution Code</b> -Use the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">
            <b>Change</b>: the defect was introduced as the result of a change needed to amend the contractual obligations,

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">
            <b>Issue</b>: the defect was introduced as the result of an issue where the defect is an internal matter of

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">
            <b>ByPass:</b> a workaround exists for the defect. Usually this resolution code is using when deferring a

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="BodyText">

    Save the form after completing the defect's information with your desired comments in the <b>Actions/Comments</b> field
    explaining better the reason why the defect is being/ has been rejected.<br />
    The defect's status is now <b>Rejected.</b><br />
    <img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_RejectedDefect.JPG" width="600" height="470" /><br />
    <br />
    <br />
    The Submitter and Project Manager will be sent an e-mail telling that the defect has been rejected.<br />
    Note that all defects which are in status <b>Raised</b> or <b>Deferred</b> can be rejected at any time.
</p>
<h3>
    <a>2.3 Set defect as Deferred</a>
</h3>
<p>
    If the defect cannot be resolved at the moment the Project Manager can defer its resolution to a future release.<br />
    In ClearQuest select <b>ChangeState.Defer</b> and complete the mandatory fields and any optional fields that you feel
    may aid in future analysis/resolution. At this point the mandatory field is <b>Resolution Code</b> and, although
    several values are allowed, probably the most suitable for this state will be <b>ByPass</b> or <b>Fix in future
    release</b>.<br />
    <img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_AddingResCodeWhenDeferring.JPG" width="600" height="470" />&nbsp;<br />
    It is a good practice to complete other optional fields (like <b>Proposed workaround</b>, <b>Additional comments</b>,
    actions comments or those related to estimates/planned dates and/or planned actions), in order to provide more
    information for future analysis/resolution or to document why the decision of postponing the defect was taken.<br />
    After completing the appropriate information save the form. The defect's status is now <b>Deferred</b>.<br />
    <img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_DeferredDefect.JPG" width="600" height="470" />Step<br />
    The Submitter and Project Manager will be sent an e-mail telling that the defect has been deferred.
</p>
<h3>
    <a>2.4 Assign a defect</a>
</h3>If the defect is valid, analyze the defect and determine who will work on it (the Resolution Owner). Once this has
been decided, in ClearQuest select <b>ChangeState.Assign</b>, and complete all mandatory fields and any optional fields
that you feel may aid in analysis/resolution. <br />

        <br />
        After completing all the required fields, save the form.
    </div>
</div><br />
The defect's status is now <b>Opened.</b> <br />
The Resolution Owner will be sent an e-mail telling that a new defect was assigned to him/her. <br />
Note that all valid defects which are in status <b>Raised</b> or <b>Deferred</b> should be assign at any time. 
<h2>
    Step 3 <a>Analyze the defect and record action for defect resolution</a>
</h2>Analyze the defect's information to ensure that there is enough information to resolve the defect and that it can be
resolved within the required timescale; also defines the schedules and planned actions required to solve the defect. <br />
In the event that the Resolution Owner cannot implement all of the actions personally, the Resolution Owner assumes
responsibility for enlisting others to implement the necessary actions. <br />
<b>If the defect's information is insufficient</b> the Resolution Owner contacts the Project Manager, Submitter of the
defect or any other stakeholder, as appropriate, for additional information. At this point both the Resolution Owner and
the Project Manager are able to document the additional information using the <b>Modify</b> action. 
<h3>
    <a>3.1 Set defect as Duplicate</a>
</h3>If the Resolution Owner finds an existing (reported) defect that encompass some or all of the new defect's symptoms,
the defect is set as <b>Duplicate</b> following the same actions defined by the Project Manager is a previous section. 
<h3>
    <a>3.2 Set defect as Rejected (invalid defect)</a>
</h3>If the Resolution Owner considers the defect is invalid, set it as <b>Rejected</b> following the same actions defined
by the Project Manager in a previous section. 
<h3>
    <a>3.3 Analyze a defect</a>
</h3>If the information of the defect is enough and the defect is confirmed -attempt to recreate the defect is necessary-
determine the actions required to resolve the defect. If the defect's impact is complex or it is expected to have
significant impact on project scope or on other projects, estimates are required. In ClearQuest select
<b>ChangeState.Analyze</b>, and complete all mandatory fields and any optional fields that you feel may aid in resolution
or it is important to document for future reference. <br />
<img alt="" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/CQ_Defect_AnalyzingDefect.JPG" width="600" height="470" /> 
<div>
    Note that some fields in the <b>Estimate/Planned</b> section will become mandatory if <b>Estimate Required?</b> is set
    to <b>Yes</b>.<br />
    After completing all the required fields -or change them as appropriate if reviewing a defect previously analyzed-,
    save the form.<br />
    The defect's status is now <b>Analyzed.</b><br />
    The Project Manager will be sent an e-mail telling that the defect has been analyzed.<br />
    <u>Important</u>: This analysis could take some time; if you are analyzing a defect and don't have all the required
    information for the mandatory fields you can register your partial information using <b>Modify</b> action by a
    <b>Save</b>. When you are ready you should select <b>ChangeState.Analyze</b> to change the defect's status.<br />
    Note that defects which are in status <b>Opened</b> or <b>Revision Required</b> should be analyzed at any time using
    the steps described here.
</div>
<h2>
    Step 4 <a>Review actions and decisions</a>
</h2>All the defects analyzed by the Resolution Owners should be reviewed by the Project Manager in order to be approved
and prioritized. 
<h3>
    <a>4.1 Return defect for further analysis</a>
</h3>If the Project Manager considers that the recommended actions or estimates documented by the Resolution Owner are not
appropriate, return the defect to the Resolution Owner for further analysis. In ClearQuest select
<b>ChangeState.Revise</b>, complete all mandatory fields and describe why the defect requires further analysis including
that in the <b>Actions/Comments</b> field. <br />

        The Resolution Owner will be sent an e-mail telling that the defect requires further analysis. 
        <h3>
            <a>4.2 Accept recommended actions</a>
        </h3>If the Project Manager considers that the recommended actions and estimates are appropriate, approve,

Once a defect's recommended actions and estimate has been approved by the Project Manager the Resolution Owner is able to
start working on the required fix. These defects can be easily distinguished as they are in status <b>Solution
Approved</b>. The defects in this status can be also found easily in the <b>DefectsApprovedForImplementation</b> query.
<br />
During resolution, record progress using <b>Modify</b> action and tracking information in the <b>Actions/Comments</b>
field. When the work to correct the defect is complete, select <b>ChangeState.Resolve</b>, and complete all mandatory

<h2>
    <a>Step 6 Track and manage outstanding defects to closure</a>
</h2>There is a public query called <b>Open Defects</b> which may be run in order to list all defects that have not been
closed yes. This query should be run periodically and the report should be reviewed for any defects that may not be
receiving the appropriate attention. Escalation procedures may need to be used in order to address any such defects. <br />
<h2>
    <a>Step 7 Analyze and report defects</a>
</h2>Run the query Defect Log (APP414) periodically to create the equivalent of the APP 414 Defect Log or DCD 325 Defect
Management Documentation. <br />
Analyze the report and update the defects with any appropriate action planned or taken. Using this query, it is not
necessary to maintain a separate defect log as the query can be run on demand. <br />
Other public queries are available to get the appropriate information in order to analyze and report defects. Additional
queries and charts can be created on demand based on needs (refer to ClearQuest User's Guide for more information). Refer
to the section 4 for more details.</td>
