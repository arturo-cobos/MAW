    This is a kind of realization decision to specify how the service interface will be interacting with its collaborators
    or consumers.<br />
    <br />
    Messages between communicating services and components are a critical part of a SOA. These include not only the input
    and output messages of a given service invocation but also the internal message format to be used within the enterprise
    as the flow of information passes through the layers of the application architecture. In many cases, a common message
    format is recommended.<br />
    <br />
    As services include input and output messages, this task focuses on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        specification of the format (XSD, XML, fixed record) of input and output messages of a service,&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;the internal common message format and considerations and
    </li>
    <li>
        decisions on how to map each of these messages to another.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    During detailed design activities, the message specification may be implemented in the form of a fixed-format, XML or
    SOAP XML message. The message specification defined should be transport protocol (HTTP, MQ, JMS, FTP, SMTP, etc.)
    agnostic. The key point here is that message specification is defined in the Service Model.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    To give you a glimpse of taking the message specification to the next step of detail, the Rent-a-car SOAP Message
    example shows an example SOAP request message that implements the Rent-a-car service message example specification. It
    is possible to create both WSDL and XML Schema from service identification which can be used to generate SOAP for
    service messages early on in the life-cycle.<br />
    <br />
    The specification of messages for the service model should take into consideration perspectives from enterprise
    architecture/application architecture, data architecture and integration architecture. This includes:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Message standards defined at an enterprise or application level
    </li>
    <li>
        Appropriate meta or data model that are part of a data architecture
    </li>
    <li>
        Message transformation standards that are part of an integration architecture.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    During specification, it is important to understand an organization’s standards, if available, in each of the 3 areas
    of architecture. Message specifications and data models are closely tied. The data model consists of underlying
    entities and their relationships, a subset of which may be sent out as part of an output message and received as an
    input from an incoming message. Thus the mapping between the message formats and the underlying data model or data
    architecture is a key architectural consideration. In some cases, patterns and their implementation such as the
    Enterprise Service Bus may handle the transformation (and routing) of messages. In many cases, we may need an explicit
    handler to transform messages from and to data models.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Message Standards</strong><br />
    When defining the message specifications for services identified, it is important to take into account an enterprise’s
    message standards if they exist. Where message standards are not defined, it is advisable to develop them. Standards
    for the following should be considered:<br />
    <br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Message structure<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This includes the definition of standard elements, their usage and placements within a message<br />
    <br />
    XML schemas<br />
    <br />
    Where industry message schemas exist, it is recommended to leverage them. For example, XML messaging specifications
    have been defined for the finance, government, travel (OTA XML), communications industries. In addition, there are
    non-industry specific schemas available from OAGIS.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Common Message Format<br />
    Common messages refer to messages that are transferred across the tiers of a n-tier architecture. Typically,
    user-interface information is captured, sent through to a controller tier, processed in the business or application
    layers and then passed on to a persistence layer or back-end legacy system. During each of these transfers, a message
    is being exchanged between tiers where each may have a different format. The key thing is to agree on one standard for
    a common message format within the enterprise so as to overcome any format translation overhead where an Enterprise
    Service Bus (ESB) is not used or when its use is deemed expensive in terms of format translation. The use of an ESB
    will take care of many of these mediations, transformations and routing. This is the Integration layer as depicted in
    the SOA layers model.<br />
    <br />
    In some cases, it may suffice to agree on the outgoing and incoming message formats. The issue of a common message
    format is a key architectural decision: you may choose to “roll your own” as specified here, adopt industry models such
    as travel industry’s OTA XML or adopt non-industry specific models such as those defined by OAGIS. In some cases, the
    decision will be to use a common enterprise message format that updates fields in the message and passes it on to the
    next tier for further processing. If such a common scheme cannot be achieved due to political factors, then adapters
    that translate messages to an internal common message format can be designed. They can also be leveraged as part of an
    ESB.<br />
    <br />
    ISV Considerations: Messages that invoke services realized within ISV packages may need to be augmented with data
    attributes to satisfy constraints within the ISV package data model. Such data elements may be identified through
    analysis of the realized service within the ISV package Component or may also be identified through the ISV package
    bottom-up service analysis. Since these attributes may not be identified until service realization, they may need to be
    retrofitted into the common message once they are identified.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Common Message Format and Data Architecture</strong><br />
    In general, services should not indicate anything about the underlying data models. Rather, they should be used to
    encapsulate the underlying data models whose data stores are leveraged by the service components that realize the
    services. Thus, services that are view, edit, delete, add search and other operations on a database may not be good
    candidates for services, but could be used as underlying component operations as they are used today.<br />
    <br />
    Existing data architectures that define conceptual, logical or physical data models are required sources in defining
    common message formats. The definitions of common message formats should be coordinated with data architecture efforts
    and data models. This analysis will ensure the availability of proper data stores and schemas for the service
    components that will realize new services. Existing data architecture will be enhanced to accommodate new services if
    new data needs to be added to the underlying systems.<br />
    <br />
    In many enterprises, existing systems often reflect the existence of silos and data islands that collaborate through
    batch processes. Migrating away from isolated data stores is possible through the means of services. Identifying a
    service provider’s data sources is accomplished during service realization.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>ISV Considerations<br />
    </strong><br />
    Logical Data Model needs to accommodate the pre-defined, often implicit data models embodied in ISV packages. Thus
    message transfer between packaged applications and the existing data models need to occur. This is often done through
    APIs offered by the ISV’s. In a SOA, adapters to these ISV data models become important, especially if the ISV is not
    exposing its underlying data and functionality through services.<br />
    <br />
    Note that in some cases where the ISV data model is accessible, it may be possible to customize the model to
    accommodate the messages required to support the identified services. Conversely, if the data model is not accessible,
    service messaging may be constrained by the data model contained within the ISV. A mediation mechanism can also be
    employed to curtail the problem. Mediation, such as that provided by an ESB can be used in this context to support
    interfacing with ISV packages. The ISV data model may also dictate additional attributes that are required above and
    beyond those required to implement the service.<br />
    <br />
    Common Message Format with all Relevant Services<br />
    Common message formats must be reconciled with the input/output messages of individual services, so they are related
    and assigned to allow appropriate services to use and update them as needed. Services may need to extract information
    from or expect output from the common enterprise message format. These are documented in the Service Common Message
    Format template.<br />
