    A <em>Technical Environment Assessment</em> might be done multiple times during the project, depending on the
    individual project. It might have been planned ahead of time to coincide with specific points in the project, such as
    one month into start-up, or it might be done to formally investigate excessive complaints or issues regarding the
    technical environment.
</p>
<p>
    The assessment is conducted with the project team and is based on their experience and perceptions. If there are
    substantiating statistics or records, include them, but collecting and evaluating such data is not usually within the
    scope of project management.
</p>
<p>
    During the assessment, the team should define the problem from their point of view, investigate the source of the
    problem, and try to identify the area of responsibility for further definition and resolution. Many times problems with
    the technical environment must be assigned to people outside the project to ascertain an accurate technical solution.
</p>
<p>
    The assessment looks at how well the implemented technical environment is meeting the requirements in the <i>Technical
    Environment Plan</i>.&nbsp; But sometimes the environment is performing as planned, however the original plan was not
    adequate and additional measures are required.
