    This task is launched when dates, products and services targeted for a given project organizational unit (POU) are
    known.&nbsp; Note that the goal here is to let each project organizational unit (POU) verify that what is expected from
    them, as described in the Project Definition, is realistic. In other terms, this activity consists of refining, in
    terms of activities, tasks, and intermediate work products, the work units that are identified in the Project
    Definition, to such a level that reliable estimates can be obtained, and to make sure that the work load and time frame
    are consistent, and that the resources will be available.
</p>
<p>
    During a selling process, as described in the Client Value Method (CVM), this PM process interacts with "Closing the
    sale" with the customer within the bid phase.
</p>
<p>
    This task includes the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Determine relevant stakeholder involvement, ensuring that all the components of the proposal will be properly
        defined and integrated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clarify deliverable definitions and quality characteristics
    </li>
    <li>
        Define deliverables components and conduct Method Adoption Workshop (MAW)
    </li>
    <li>
        Organize work breakdown structure (WBS) and determine team structure
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The key outputs of this task are plans at the POU level: the Deliverable Definitions, the Product Breakdown Structure,
    the Work Product List, the team structure in the Organizational Breakdown Structure, the Human Resource Plan, POU
    estimates in the Financial Plan (will be consolidated later in Finalize sponsor agreement task) the Work Breakdown
    Structure, high-level Project Management Schedule for the POU and the Project Management System Summary.

    <li>
        Document their participation in the Communications Management Plan or the Stakeholder Participation Management
        Plan, or both.

<p>
    The Stakeholder Participation Management Plan should be used in addition to the Communications Management Plan to
    supplement information about stakeholders that is not captured in the Communications Management Plan for complex
    projects or projects without strong support for organizational change.
</p>
<p>
    In small organizations where control is centralized and there is strong support for organizational change, or the
    client is experienced with this type of change and has a defined strategy, the stakeholders' information, requirements,
    and their involvement can be documented in the Communications Management Plan.
</p>
<p>
    The key outputs of this task are the Communications Management Plan or the Stakeholder Participation Management Plan,
    or both, noting that both of these may be part of the Project Management System Summary.

<p>
    Break down the operational deliverables to a level that allows you to recognize:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An existing component/asset from which the product breakdown structure element will easily be derived.
    </li>
    <li>
        A component that can be bought off the shelf or subcontracted.
    </li>
    <li>
        A component for which a technical delivery process and related estimating technique are known.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A Method Adoption Workshop (MAW) is conducted, when appropriate.&nbsp;During the MAW, a review of the business
    requirements is done to aid in the method selection process.&nbsp; Method content is available on MethodWeb for review
    and download to the tailoring tool (i.e. RMC). A basic work breakdown structure (WBS) is created during this tailoring
    process and is used as a basis to build the project plan.
</p>
<p>
    Enhance the Work breakdown structure (WBS) by describing the activities that are necessary to build, integrate, and
    rework the work products to be delivered by the project organizational unit.

    Definition, is realistic. In other terms, this activity consists of refining, in terms of activities, tasks, and
    intermediate work products, the work units that are identified in the Project Definition, to such a level that reliable
    estimates can be obtained, and to make sure that the work load and time frame are consistent, and that the resources
    will be available.
</p>
<p>
    This steps includes the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify the components, breakdown of components, or intermediate work products, for each work product to be
        delivered to the sponsor or to another project organizational unit. This component breakdown should reach a level
        that the components are recognized as belonging to a technical work pattern and related estimating
        technique&nbsp;are known, or the components are identifiable as reusable assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the components in the Product Breakdown Structure (PBS).
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the layout of activities necessary to create those components or intermediate work products in an orderly
        manner, and make a crude estimate of the workload and duration for performing those activities. A method adoption
        workshop (MAW) can assist for some technical work products, but likely will not provide all the information
        required.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the Work Product List and the initial Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the POU.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the process, methods and tools described in the proposal for planned usage and used in delivery on the
        project across all delivery sites in the PM&T Profile.
    </li>
