    The testing strategy should be developed concurrent with (or as part of) the Statement of Work. In the preliminary
    discussion with the client and business units, the generic strategy and some of the concepts of using the full
    lifecycle testing approach should be initiated.&nbsp; If the Statement of Work is already signed, or it is too late to
    incorporate the testing strategy, this should be one of the first steps to discuss as the engagement is kicked off, and
    certainly before the project work plans and schedules are prepared.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The objective in doing this is to educate the client that testing effort is significant (especially in the emerging
    e-business technologies), that testing will not just happen and most importantly, to get the client buy-in.&nbsp; Doing
    so makes it easier to get testing estimates approved, and will help the client management to get their staff involved
    at the appropriate time in the lifecycle, and encourage them to take ownership of acceptance testing.
</p>
<p>
    To develop the test strategy, it is suggested that the test manager, or test manager designate, investigate to find out
    what testing methods, standards and procedures already in place at the client organization that can be applied quite
    effectively.&nbsp; Once this is completed, the test manager should put together a “straw man” for discussion with the
    business requirements owner, and to provide an overview or “awareness” education.&nbsp; During this session, testing
    levels and types from IBM’s test methodology are compared with those at the client organization, and reconciled so that
    the testing strategy reflects, where possible and appropriate, the client environment and terminology.&nbsp; If the
    client has no established or consistent set of testing methods that are practiced, then IBM’s testing work products set
    is used to document the strategy.&nbsp; It is also recommended that a glossary of testing terms be included in the
    testing strategy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    If the engagement involves a number of projects which are distinct entities, but which are similar in terms of business
    functionality or technology implementation, it may be prudent to create one test strategy that, after review by the
    client and refinements, could form a standard template for creating test strategies for the subsequent projects.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    If there are multiple projects involving the same application or the same set of applications, then it is possible that
    a testing strategy can be created, using the steps described in the Development Approach section above, and then
    applied as a template.
