    <strong>Business and IT Planning</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    Identify requirements for a test environment at project start-up time. Understand the organizational context. This step
    is particularly important for an established test facility, but is a useful starting point for building any test
    environment. A detailed list of tasks is in the supporting files.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Systems Management</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    Perform test environment capacity planning activities. Ensure that the process is in place to keep the test environment
    synchronized with the other development, test, and/or production environments as required (e.g., DASD, servers,
    version/releases of system software). Ensure that processes are in place for change management, problem management, and
    software configuration management.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Test Environment Management</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    Understand which new and/or existing test environment policies affect this project. Review test environment staff
    skills. Secure new test environment skills as needed to support project. Plan, schedule, and manage test environment
    staff activities.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Plan for introducing hardware, software and network components. Schedule and prioritize testing in the test
    environment. Maintain and publish test environment testing schedule. Assemble all related test environment
    configuration documentation and provide to Test Environment Coordinator.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Work with Test Plan Coordinator when plan is invoked. Notify appropriate project teams which test environment testing
    activities are available or not, and when. Work with project and release managers to reschedule any conflicts.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Maintain test environment asset inventory.<br />
    See Supporting files for more detailed tasks for Test Facility Management.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Test Environment Involvement in Project Management</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    Ensure test environment resources are involved and participating in project and test project reviews. Keep them
    informed of changes, issues and risk management strategies.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Prepare high level estimates for test environment specific activities (project resources, costs, price, duration).
    Identify necessary project resources specific to test environment. Determine the availability of the identified
    resources for test environment.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Plan for non-application directed testing projects (e.g., environment and/or infrastructure changes that do not require
    application testing). Plan for introducing production equivalent hardware, software, and network components into the
    test environment (in sync with the other development, test and/or production environments as required).<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Product Evaluation and Recommendation</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    Evaluate and select new/additional test environment testing and monitoring tools. Communicate selected test environment
    testing and monitoring tool recommendations. Evaluate new hardware, software, and network components needed to support
    application and non-functional testing in test environment. Communicate hardware, software, and network
    recommendations.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Product Acquisition and Installation</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    Procure new/additional test environment testing and monitoring tools according to organizational approvals, policy, and
    procedures. Install new/additional test environment testing and monitoring tools. Train test environment staff on new
    tool usage.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Procure new hardware, software, and network components needed to support application and non-functional testing in test
    environment. Install new hardware, software, and network components. Stabilize new hardware, software, and network
    components. Migrate to the other development, test and/or production environments as required. Restabilize in the other
    environments.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>System Requirements Analysis</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    Review business and application requirements, such as events and scenarios, to determine additional requirements
    necessary for the test environment. Review non-functional requirements; e.g., performance, stress and volume testing,
    for the test environment. Identify impacts to current (in-place) test environment and infrastructure.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Define application and non-functional test environment test strategy. Review test types to be performed in test
    environment. Identify dependent applications required for testing in the test environment. Identify external dependent
    applications required for testing in the test environment. Define test environment test strategy for non-application
    directed testing projects (e.g., environment and/or infrastructure changes that do not require application
    testing).<br />
</p>
<p>
    Develop detailed estimates covering test environment specific activities (project resources, costs, price, duration).
    Identify necessary project resources specific to test environment. Determine the availability of the identified
    resources for test environment.<br />
</p>
<p>
