    The Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis work product is the summarization of information from the RFI and/or research.
    This work product is used to assist the project team in evaluating a "long list" of potential vendors in order to
    identify an "interim list" of vendors that best meets the needs of the business.
</p>
<p>
    The Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis work product details the team’s findings and justifies elimination of vendors to
    the client, thus gaining "buy in" from the client.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of this work product is to provide a document that can be used in a structured presentation to the client
    executives to lead them through the selection process to get to a list of interim vendors. The document will also serve
    as a reference guide for the client to justify, to their organization, which vendors will be part of the detailed
    selection process.

    The Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis work product captures valuable information provided from the vendors’ Request for
    Information (RFI) responses. This information helps the team evaluate each vendor's viability as a software provider.
    This work product captures the following information about the vendors, where available:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        General
    </li>
    <li>
        Company Profile
    </li>

    <li>
        Stability and Focus
    </li>
    <li>
        Duration in Business
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>

</ul><p/><p>
    The IBM consultant will use the vendor information to analyze each potential vendor’s ability to satisfy the initial
    future capabilities and attributes identified by the client. The Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis work product assists
    in completing this task in order to eliminate vendors to reach an "interim list" of vendors.

    The Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis work product provides a summary view of information gathered about the “long
    list” of vendors for comparison and elimination of vendors.&nbsp; It captures data on the overall stability of the
    vendors and their products as well as their industry focus.&nbsp; This work product overviews the vendors’ technology,
    functionality and provides general information about the vendors for review by the team.
</p>
<p>
    This work product is normally developed in a series of spreadsheets, but may be created in a database or in word
    processing tables.
</p>
<p>
    The Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis work product should consist of the following work sheets or pages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Title Page</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>General Information</strong> - This section captures company profile information such as name, locations,
        number of employees, contact data, web sites, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stability/Focus</strong> - This section details company history information such as number of years in
        business, number of installations, industry focus and client base.&nbsp; It may also be used to capture financial
        performance and risk assessment information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Technology Overview</strong> - This section details the general technology base of the product such as
        operating system, database(s), hardware requirements, etc.&nbsp; It also looks at type of technology and interface
        provided by the vendor (i.e., Client/Server, GUI, etc.). It looks at the security standards and interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Functionality Overview</strong> - This section outlines the functional capabilities of the software being
        offered by the vendor against the required functional criteria.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Vendor Elimination</strong> - This section details the elimination of vendors from consideration, listing
        the reason for elimination.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interim List</strong> - This section identifies the resulting “interim list” of vendors that will be
        considered going forward in the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After the analysis is complete, the information should be displayed in a presentation for the sponsor.&nbsp; The main
    advantage of the work product is to take the&nbsp;sponsor through the process of the interim list selection; therefore,
    the presentation format seems to be the preferred approach to creating this interactive discussion session.
</p>
<p>
    The main sections of the presentation portion of the work product include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Cover Sheet
    </li>
    <li>
        Table of Contents
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        Screening Criteria appropriate for the&nbsp;target environment

    The important outcome, however reached, is to gain the client’s agreement that the vendors on the short list are the
    correct vendors to work with through the detailed selection process.&nbsp; The evaluation criteria for reaching an
    “interim list” of vendors should be clearly defined and agreed upon by the client.&nbsp; It is necessary that the
    client agrees with the short list findings and that they consider the list complete.&nbsp; This verification at this
    point will avoid having them second-guess the process and vendors consideration in the latter stages of the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    This work product should provide the necessary detail to lead the client executive team through the process and the
    justification of selecting which vendors should be considered in detail for the client solution.&nbsp; The document
    recommendations should be validated by the client for completeness to avoid the client coming back later and
    questioning why certain vendors were not considered.&nbsp; The Summary worksheet should be validated with the client
    team lead to ensure agreement on the elimination criteria.
</p>
<p>
    The Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis should be validated through checking the vendor responses against the data
    captured in the template.&nbsp; Research should be performed to validate financial data and the use of third party
    research should be included in the analysis where appropriate and available.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis provides validation of an "interim list" selection and reduces risk to the
    success of the project. Without the Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis which details each vendors overall viability as a
    software provider, it is difficult to determine whether or not each vendor offers the general functionality, stability
    and technology to satisfy the client’s goals and objectives for their software selection project.
</p><p/><p>
    By eliminating the Pre-Qualification Vendor Analysis, you do not fully utilize valuable information gathered and
    increase your exposure on the project. Without the work product, the client may not understand why certain vendors were
    chosen or eliminated. Without this understanding of who and why they are on the interim list, time will be wasted as
    the client continues to question or second guess vendors.

indicated that IBM did not assist in the selection of that list. In some cases, the client has already had other consulting
groups perform this work, or the organization has outlined standards that need to be followed. In either case, if the
client has an interim list of vendors that will only be considered, then the process can start with the validation of those
vendors and this work product will not be used.</td>
