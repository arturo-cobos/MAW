architecting and designing the network by describing the network that will support the business requirements. It is
especially critical since it is typically the very first time during a network design project that the sponsor will
actually see the first ‘picture’ of the future network design. The conceptual design is used to help the executive sponsor
understand how the network design addresses the stated business goals, objectives, and requirements. The conceptual design
is also used as the basis for the Network Specified Design.</td>

broken into two levels. The Level 0 Network Conceptual Design depicts the relationship of the required internal/external
services and user communities. The Level 1 Network Conceptual Design adds the next level of detail depicting access nodes,
backbone nodes, security nodes, connections, user communities, and service connections for the basic network infrastructure
using client terminology (locations, buildings, sites, etc.).</td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Notation</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    The notation used in defining a Level 0 Network Conceptual Design is in the form of a diagram such as a barometric
    chart that shows the relationship between the user communities, required services, and the network nodes (access,
    backbone, security, etc).
</p>
<p>
    The notation used in defining a Level 1 Network Conceptual Design uses standard block and line topology diagrams to
    represent conceptual nodes and connections (non vendor specific symbols).&nbsp; Since this is the first occurrence of
    expressing the network in ‘pictures’, and this is still considered to be a ‘high level’ effort rather than a ‘detailed’
    effort, the diagrams used to express a Network Conceptual Design typically contain non-descriptor or generic devices
    used to represent nodes and lines or arrows are used to represent network connections.&nbsp; Generic devices are used
    since at this point of the overall network design effort NO vendor products have yet been identified (nor should they
    be identified at this early step).
</p><p/><p>
    It is important that the diagrams produced by this effort are a reflection of the nodes, components, locations,
    buildings, sites, etc. showing the recommended connections needed to support the business requirements (as expressed in
    the network strategy and architecture).&nbsp; This is important since it demonstrates to the&nbsp;client our
    understanding of their environment and gives them a feeling for where the ultimate network design is headed.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The terminology used when selling a network design engagement MUST be clearly articulated and defined - initially to
    the client and then in the proposal (and to the engagement team).&nbsp; These terms can very easily be misrepresented,
    misunderstood, or misconstrued, and it is very difficult to complete a successful engagement if the client thinks they
    are getting a ‘Specified Design’, when in the network consultants’ minds they are only planning to do a ‘Conceptual
    Design’ with no intent of getting to a deeper level of design.&nbsp; In particular, be very careful when using terms
    such as ‘high level design’ or ‘low level design’ without doing an additional level of qualification as to what
    deliverables the client actually will be getting.&nbsp; An effective technique to use here is to actually show the
    client sample sections of prior engagement deliverables that help to distinguish between the terms ‘high level’ and
    ‘low level.’&nbsp; Or better yet, use the definitions and examples found in the Networking Methodology and in the work
    product descriptions for conceptual, specified, and node designs.&nbsp; An additional reference source is the
    Architecture Description Standard (ADS) document that clearly specifies the vocabulary and distinction in levels of
    design.
</p>
<p>
    It is important that the diagrams produced by this effort are a reflection of the client nodes, components, locations,
    buildings, sites, etc. showing the recommended connections needed to support the business requirements (as expressed in
    the network strategy and architecture).&nbsp; This is important since it demonstrates to the client our understanding
    of their environment and gives them a feeling for where the ultimate network design is headed.
</p>
<p>
    It is key to include an experienced Network Architect during the development of this work product. The networking
    industry is changing at such a rapid rate that to attempt to do any Network Design without this level of experience and
    skill in networking standards, protocols, products, industry directions, etc. will surely result in a less than
    satisfactory engagement.
