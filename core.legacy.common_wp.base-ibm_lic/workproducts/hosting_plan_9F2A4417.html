<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Successful deployment of a system is very dependent on how well the developers and content owners are able to promote
    content seamlessly to the hosting complex, and the degree to which users can access it effectively depends on the
    quality of the Hosting Plan.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the Hosting Plan is to plan the deployment of the hosting environment that supports the operational web
    delivery requirements. This deployment should be coordinated with the implementation of the other web applications and
    the refresh cycle of the content associated with these applications. This requires that a well-defined change
    management procedure will be instituted.
</p>
<p>
    The second purpose of this work product is to produce a seamless rollout plan for the web applications, including the
    integrated and stress testing of these systems on the staging environment. The introduction of new applications or
    content should not introduce new or unacceptable risk into the production system. The Hosting Plan should take into
    consideration the different locations to be used for delivery and the logistics surrounding the support and maintenance
    of these environments.

    The organization that is responsible for web hosting is specified, along with the associated responsibilities. The
    capacity, hosting environment with any specific hardware or software environment, the service levels, security
    resilience, as well as the average and peak throughput is defined. The production and staging environment linkages are
    specified. Planning for the hosting environment must take into account the acceptable quality level of the system based
    on the acceptance criteria. This expected quality level is the ultimate requirement that governs the hosting
    environment.
</p>
<p>
    The Hosting Plan describes the steps that will be performed to construct, configure, tune and bring online the hosting
    system that satisfies the stated requirements. The plan describes clearly and fully how to set up the staging and
    production environments and the acceptable system behaviors in response to specific throughput levels. The web
    behaviors need to be stated in such a way that will be obvious whether or not the system behaved according to
    specification.

<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Start by understanding the customerâ€™s expectations regarding hosting. If possible, benchmark the application on a
    number of systems to determine where the bottlenecks are occurring. In most Hosting Plans, contingency is a critical
    element to understand. Often times, network and system performance degradations play a major role in application
    availability. Focusing on what is driving traffic to the site will often allow for peak performance planning. Designing
    applications for performance is often essential in a web enabled environment.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The Hosting Plan often contains several components; the project plan to implement hosting on the site, a responsibility
    matrix that defines who is responsible for what, a series of planned review cycles, and a hosting support plan that
    details responsibilities in critical situations.<br />
</p>
<p>
    A Hosting Plan should always be prepared for any site that will be delivering content to another organization whether
    via the World Wide Web or through a private Intranet or Extranet.
</p>
<p>
    It is usually good to have the plan validated by the organization that conducts the performance, stress and security
    testing.
</p>
<p>
    A content shedding plan may be appropriate for a site with high traffic swings. The following is a sample content
    shedding plan from a sports event site.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Content Shedding Plan (example):</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    A content shedding hierarchy for the XYZ Event was instituted. In case of extremely high site traffic (and oxygen masks
    drop from the ceiling), we will implement the steps below to help manage traffic to acceptable server capacity and
    open-net bandwidth requirements. Here is the order of steps to take, and who is responsible for implementing each
    step:<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Content Shedding Measure</b><br />
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. Back off the javascoreboard update frequency by 15 seconds.<br />
        2. Set the other.html refresh rate to an artificially high number.<br />
        3. Turn off the meta refresh on the leaderboard index.html page.<br />
        4. Turn off netcam page display on the javascoreboard.<br />
        5. Turn on the home page slimfast layout (which removes the fader also). This is an alternate home page with 80%+
        of the image content removed (9K verse 115K size).<br />
        6. Continue to reduce frequency of scoring updates in 15 second decrements.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> IBM Global Networking will let us know as traffic approaches thresholds that will cause us to implement
    each of these shedding procedures.
