    The Focal Area to which the&nbsp;leading practices conform&nbsp;can be a specific business or IT capability that
    supports a desired outcome or value proposition (i.e., capture customer information, match products and services to
    customer needs, etc.), or a process area (i.e., select markets, fulfill products and services, service customers, etc).
</p>
<p>
    Leading practices are identified by the way a company:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Structures its business model to achieve business goals and objectives
    </li>
    <li>
        Interacts, transacts, and exchanges value with suppliers, complementors, competitors/substitutes and other external
        parties
    </li>
    <li>
        Performs a process via its management policies and procedures
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizes its people around a process

    If the analysis is being done at the strategy level, the following criteria and detail should be considered:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Business Design</b> - how the business is structured and organized
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Key Value Propositions</b> - the value outcomes the business delivers to its customers and other constituents
        with whom it does business
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Key Capabilities</b> - what the company does that allows it to create, capture and sustain value
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Sources of Value Capture</b> - how the company makes a profit and recoups other forms of value through exchanges
        with others with whom it does business

    <li>
        <b>Sources of Strategic Control</b> - how competitive advantage is achieved and maintained

</ul>
<p>
    If the analysis is being done for major processes or process areas, the following criteria and detail should be
    considered:
</p>
<p>
    Each practice has a textual description, which may be structured using the following sections:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Process Name</b> - Identifies process classification using the Universal Process Classification Scheme developed
        by the International Benchmarking Clearinghouse (IBC)

    <li>
        <b>Industry Classification</b> - Identifies internal, industry, and cross-industry usage of the “leading practice”

    <li>
        <b>Description</b> - Phrases describing the “leading practice” process
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Process Outcomes</b> - A description of the various outputs of a process which are representative of a “leading
        practice.” A brief description of how the company accomplished their outcomes
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Leading Practices/Enablers</b> - The things built into a process, which enable a capability. These are
        categorized into three groups: management policies and procedures, technology and organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Metrics</b> - Actual metrics are included when such data is available.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Importance to company</b> - Provides insight to the current or potential usage and high level assessment of
        potential benefits
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Company Information</b> - Identifies referenced company performing the leading practice (including time frames
        of implemented leading practice)

        It is extremely important to clearly understand what is needed and to correctly target the Leading Practices
        research.&nbsp; This will ensure that client expectations are appropriately met, that the research and deliverables
        provide the appropriate information and value, and that time spent doing data collection is minimized versus
        spending inordinate amounts of time and reaching overload.
    </li>
    <li>
        If primary research or benchmarking will be done, it is important for the client project team to document and
        understand the leading practices as thoroughly as possible.&nbsp; Where feasible, it may be helpful to contact the
        company performing the leading practice directly to ask more specific questions.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        During the Strategy Development work efforts, Executive Visioning sessions, and other key work sessions, executives
        often ask many questions about the ways other companies are performing certain activities and the benefits those
        companies are receiving.&nbsp; The client project team gains strong credibility when they can immediately answer
        leading practice-related questions from the executives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Leading practices should be oriented around industry (and when possible, should be prepared in advance around key
        issue or impact areas based upon industry knowledge or experience).
    </li>
    <li>
        Consultants should also refer to AdvisoryWare, an IBM tool that expresses some best practices in terms of
        particular metrics, such as the "speed to process a loan", but mostly describes leading practices in terms of
        characteristics or enablers of a process or capability, such as the use of bar codes, wireless devices, dynamic
        order guides etc. for managing inventory and orders.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is important to note that in multi-divisional companies, sometimes the scope of the engagement is to determine
        "leading practices" within the company.&nbsp; Consultants should use basic process related work products for
        benchmarking within a company.&nbsp; They can try to facilitate the client as to which may be a better practice
        using ICAP.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure the sources of all collected information are documented and maintained.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <em>Note: The Leading Practices work product uses the generic process classification scheme which is based on the
    Universal Process Classification Scheme developed by the International Benchmarking Clearinghouse (IBM is a
    participating corporate member of the International Benchmarking Clearinghouse).&nbsp;This helps to identify potential
    processes.</em><br />
