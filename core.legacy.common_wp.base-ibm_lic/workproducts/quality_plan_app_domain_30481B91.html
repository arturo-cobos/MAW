    The Quality Plan for Application Domain describes the organization, activities, and project factors that have been put
    in place to achieve the planned level of quality for all work products in the application domain.&nbsp; It provides a
    framework for continuous improvement through quality reviews.&nbsp; Through the use of the project quality plan, if one
    exists, it defines the approach to be taken when planning and tracking the quality of the application development work
    products to ensure conformance to specified requirements and that expectations are being met.&nbsp; However, the scope
    does not include the quality assurance of the development process.
</p>
<p>
    The Quality Plan document includes the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Quality criteria: The characteristics that must be considered as the deliverables are being built.
    </li>
    <li>
        Quality contributors: Project factors that, when applied, will assist in achieving the quality objectives.
    </li>

            <li>
                Dynamic testing: testing by exercising the code.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <li>
        Quality roles and responsibilities: Definition of roles and organizations responsible for performing those roles.

        Quality standards and methods: Mapping of quality contributors and project procedures to required quality

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The Quality Plan for Application Domain should be kept simple, realistic, and achievable. It is likely that the sponsor
    will want to approve the project quality plan. The project quality plan should be used as the main driver for the
    Quality Plan for Application Domain. Discussing the content of the Quality Plan with the sponsor would help to increase
    his confidence in the project.
</p>
<p>
    The objective of the Quality Plan for AD is to ensure that the deliverables meet the acceptance criteria specified in
    the Agreement. If too little quality activity is performed, the deliverables will be unacceptable. If too much quality
    activity is performed, unnecessary and unplanned costs will be incurred.
</p>
<p>
    Generally speaking, test focus areas referenced in the test strategy and master test plan are the quality criteria for
    testing. These are driven by the business and technical requirements and are based on the risks and costs as defined in
    the brief outline section. The test objectives are based on the test focus areas (quality criteria). Quality
    contributors are project factors that, when applied, will assist in achieving the quality objectives for testing.
    Testing types are logical tests that are used as tools during the physical levels of testing to ensure that the test
    objectives are met.
</p>
<p>
    Quality planning for testing must consider the cost/benefit trade-off. The primary benefit of performing quality
    activities is less re-work, which means higher productivity, lower costs, and increased satisfaction. There is a cost
    associated with performing those quality/testing activities, however. Therefore, the test manager must continually
    weigh the trade-off between the benefits realized and the costs incurred.
</p>
<p>
    The testing procedures are documented through the various testing work products. The Quality Plan for Application
    Domain also shows how Quality Strategies for testing are implemented.
</p>
<p>
    The detailed plans for testing document the activities relating to each detailed level of testing.
</p>
<p>
    Where applicable, the quality-plans must conform to ISO9000 and any other relevant standards that have been adopted by
    the delivery organization or requested by the sponsor.
</p>
<p>
    The level of quality built into the plan must match the requirements in the <i>Agreement – Statement of Work</i>.
    Falling short may result in an unacceptable level of solution quality. Providing quality above what is required may
    increase the cost beyond what was agreed to with the sponsor and jeopardize schedule commitments.

    Without a Quality Plan, neither the sponsor nor the application development team can be confident that the work
    products/deliverables will meet the agreed-upon acceptance criteria.&nbsp; It will be difficult to verify and validate
    that the deliverables will meet the quality expectations for the product.
</p><p/><p>
    Failure to focus on the quality of the work products/deliverables may result in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The&nbsp;client not accepting the deliverables.
    </li>
    <li>
        Client&nbsp;dissatisfaction.

</ul>
<p>
    In extreme situations this could result in IBM not receiving payment for work performed, and/or legal ramifications.
</p>
<p>
    If a separate quality plan for application domain is not created for an engagement, then the quality expectations of
    the client, together with the methods and a plan to achieve them, must be documented and implemented as part of the
    overall project quality plan.

        In a small project, the manager can often simply provide direction to the team about how the project will identify

        In a project with a familiar context, where all team members involved may be well acquainted with how the work will
