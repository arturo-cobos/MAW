    The <b>Enterprise Technology Framework</b> work product is a key component part of an enterprise-wide business and IT
    architecture (normally referred to as an Enterprise Architecture). An Enterprise Technology Framework defines the
    technology services and functions (IT capabilities) required to support the business applications and data, including
    Common Application Services, Common Data Services, Common System Services, Network Services, Security Services,
    Platform Services, as well as the management tools used to support the delivery of IT service. The Enterprise
    Technology Framework must be totally aligned with the business applications and data, if the business goals, objectives
    and benefits are to be realized.
</p>
<p>
    This work product may be produced to varying levels of detail depending on the stage at which it is produced. This work
    product does <u>not</u> represent a complete functional specification of the future IT requirements. Rather, it defines
    them at a sufficient level to allow alternate potential technologies and solution paths to be evaluated and investment
    decisions to be made prior to proceeding with the design and implementation of specific hardware and software
    components and application systems.
</p>
<p>
    The Enterprise Technology Framework provides a conceptual model&nbsp;which is defined at two levels:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conceptual model - basic level</strong> (produced to some level or another in most architecture or technology
    based engagements). This base Conceptual Model identifies and defines all the technology functions required by the
    enterprise and develops a single graphical representation at a high level, showing relationships and interdependencies.
    This model becomes a "repository" of information about technology across the enterprise. As this model is defined the
    work product:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Describes the IT functionality needed to support each of the desired IT services
    </li>
    <li>
        Documents the characteristics that the future IT environment(s) must have
    </li>
    <li>
        Documents the measurable performance targets (at an overall level) the future IT environment(s) must be able to
        support
    </li>
    <li>
        Rates the functionality requirements for each desired IT service in terms of their importance and contribution to
        achieving the desired strategic position
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies candidate technologies that may be implemented, along with the feasibility of deploying those
        technologies and the potential impact they will have on the ability to deliver the required services
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Conceptual Model - Logical Functional level.</strong> At this Logical Functional level, instances of the
    technology functions defined in the base level are assembled into Logical Functional Environments that depict potential
    system boundaries based on sharing, usage and management rules. This level of the model purposely ignores the
    limitations imposed by technology and geography, leaving these to be addressed at the system design level when specific
    performance, availability and manageability design requirements will be addressed.
</p>
<p>
    Various views of both levels of the Enterprise Technology Framework can be defined to show the technology services and
    functions required in support of various user groups, locations and business areas.
</p></td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Notation</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    The primary notation used in the Enterprise Technology Framework is that of the Architecture Building Block
    (ABB).<br />
    The ABB is a construct used in both levels of the Enterprise Technology Framework and in essence, each ABB is a
    repository of information for the area defined.
</p>
<p>
    The content of the Enterprise Technology Framework will be documented in the following way:
</p>
<p>
    A graphical representation that shows the main ABBs and their inter-relationships – at the base level of the Conceptual
    Model
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A detailed definition of the contents of each ABB which includes: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Future functional/non-functional requirements, including levels of integration, interchangeability,
                openness, customizability or other relevant attributes and required performance targets
            </li>
            <li>
                Current implementation
            </li>
            <li>
                Planned/target implementation (next 12 months)
            </li>
            <li>
                Any identified transition issues/considerations
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Spreadsheets showing the sharing, usage and management characteristics of ABBs, based on users, locations, business
        area, risk and management requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Graphical representations of the spreadsheets - Logical Functional level
    </li>
</ul><p/><p>
    At system design time, when specific instances of each ABB need to be implemented, the IBM Architecture Definition
    Standard (ADS) is used. In ADS terms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An Application or Data ABB typically corresponds to an application subsystem (one or more related application
        components)
    </li>
    <li>
        A System Services ABB typically corresponds to a technical subsystem (one or more related technical components)
    </li>
    <li>
        A Network ABB typically corresponds to a combination of one or more technical components, and possibly associated
        network nodes (specialist network hardware such as routers)
    </li>
    <li>
        An Operational ABB typically corresponds to a node (processing platform), plus its operating system, plus possibly
        other technical components
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The precise mapping of ABBs to ADS components and nodes depends on how an individual system is designed.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The Enterprise Technology Framework is not static. Once an initial definition has been completed, it will continue to
    evolve over time and to further levels of detail, as both the business requirements and technology options change.
</p>
<p>
    To be effective, the Enterprise Technology Framework must reflect the business, application and data needs of the
    enterprise. In practice this means that key inputs will come from several detailed work products, including Strategic
    Directions, Capability Model, Process Enablers, Application Function Model, Data Stores and Data and Function Access
    and Placement.
</p>
<p>
    There is a considerable amount of intellectual capital, which exists in many of the ICM databases, to help with these
    activities. A major source is the IT Architecture and Design KN database and the e-Business KN databases:
</p>
<p>
    Review other architecture models and frameworks: Never start with a blank sheet of paper, when you are trying to define
    an Enterprise Technology Framework - there are many pre-defined technology models, frameworks and samples that have
    been produced in previous engagements for you to work from
</p>
<p>
    Pick one or two samples that reflect your client's organization, needs, etc. For example, the type of Enterprise
    Technology Framework that is needed for an organization in Mergers and Acquisition mode could be very different from
    one that has been outsourced. Providing a visual example of what you are trying to produce is very effective.
</p>
<p>
    Each ABB should map to a definable collection of components, processes or functions.&nbsp; Very often there may be
    common components across many ABBs - this would indicate good synergy and effective reuse of items to satisfy multiple
    business needs, for example, the use of common interfaces.&nbsp; When this happens, consider defining these common
    components as a separate ABB.
</p>
<p>
    The way the ABBs relate to each other is also significant.&nbsp; Certain ABBs may require the use of functions provided
    by other ABBs in order to deliver their own function.&nbsp; This is particularly true of systems management functions
    in a technical architecture. Consider that Security functions can be required and delivered within application,
    network, and operations and as separate a separate service.
</p>
<p>
    Often different Architecture views may help convey a clearer message and focus activities. Supplying information on how
    to interpret and use the Enterprise Technology Framework may also help ensure successful interpretation and use of the
    information.
</p>
<p>
    Remember, architecture modeling is an iterative task - the Enterprise Technology Framework will evolve over time as the
    content of each ABB is developed, defined and further more detailed work products are produced, as individual systems
    are designed and implemented and as component decisions are made.
</p>
<p>
    Terminology warning: Note that in Enterprise Architecture work the word ‘component’ is sometimes used as a generic term
    for any element of an architecture, (in contrast to the more specific and precise meaning of component in ADS.)&nbsp;
    See for example ‘Architecture Component’ in examples.
