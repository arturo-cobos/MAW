    There are many different types and levels of IT Architecture reviews and assessments which can be undertaken.&nbsp;The
    review is conducted at a management level, providing observations and recommendations which will allow executives to
    make decisions on the future directions and management of the IT Architecture in question. The activity is usually
    requested when a sponsor wishes to have an 'external view' of the quality and completeness of the architecture
    activities which have been completed so far, or requires guidance on how the enterprise-wide IT Architecture can be
    effectively managed and implemented. This work product is used to measure the qualities of the main component parts of
    the architecture and the effectiveness of its organizational implementation. It does not provide a review or assessment
    of the systems that are derived from the architecture.<br />
</p>
<p>
    This review and assessment is normally completed at two levels:<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Basic level</b> - this level uses common criteria used to assess all elements of the architecture:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Completeness - suitable for required business and IT usage
    </li>
    <li>
        Communication - both formal and informal, throughout the organization, with appropriate education and briefing
        materials available at all relevant levels
    </li>
    <li>
        Documentation - which is clear, usable and freely accessible to all who need to use it (business users, business
        and IT management, developers and operations staff)
    </li>
    <li>
        Currency - has recently been reviewed and, where necessary updated
    </li>
    <li>
        Coverage - spans the needs of the whole client organization
    </li>
    <li>
        Usage - there is official management buy-in and agreement at all appropriate levels
    </li>
    <li>
        Linkages - there are clear linkages between all aspects of the architecture at the enterprise level (business,
        application, data and technical)
    </li>
    <li>
        Durability - has a long-term (3 - 5 year) outlook, as well as a rolling, short-term implementation plan which is
        achievable
    </li>
    <li>
        Management - has agreed, working roles, responsibilities and management processes which are simple and effective
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    <b>Detailed level</b> - this level uses specific criteria to assess the content of the architecture. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Vision - is there a clear vision driven by business requirements; have assumptions and constraints been documented;
        are the different stake-holders identified and are there appropriate architectural views which reflect the
        requirements of all the user groups in the organization?
    </li>
    <li>
        Principles - are these documented clearly, with associated motivation and implication statements; do they map back
        to the business requirements and desired distinctive capabilities; are they ‘good’ principles; has the business as
        well as IT management bought into them?
    </li>
    <li>
        Enterprise Technology Framework - is this portrayed clearly, with defined 'building blocks' of function (future
        requirements, current implementation and target implementation); are there alternate views eg user group, business
        function, logical location, network/topology, systems management; does the framework identify existing components
        which can be re-used and common future components which can be shared?
    </li>
    <li>
        Decision Framework - is there a defined and agreed process for evaluating and selecting components, packages and
        suppliers; are there evaluation criteria for function (business function, standards compliance, performance,
        availability, etc.); architecture conformance; vendor issues (for example, support structures), cost of ownership?
    </li>
    <li>
        Standards - have these been defined, documented and are they appropriate for the client's business?
    </li>
    <li>
        Architecture Management Framework - are there defined processes which support the client management structure; is
        there clear, recognized ownership of the architecture; do the processes cover the maintenance and vitality of the
        architecture, compliance to, deviation from and communication within the organization; is there evidence that these
        processes are exercised and the architecture is enforced; are there process interlocks with other corporate and
        associated processes, e.g. business and IT planning?
    </li>
    <li>
        Transition and Infrastructure Plan - do these plans exist; are there budgets for them, with assigned resources and
        a project manager; does each plan contain the essential elements of goals and objectives, work structure and scope,
        organization responsibilities and management; risks, assumptions and dependencies?
    </li>
    <li>
        As the architecture is assessed, scores are assigned to each criterion on a scale of '1' through to '5', being
        equivalent to 'Inadequate' through to 'World-Class'. In this instance ‘World Class’ is defined as being recognized
        as ‘best of breed’ and industry referenceable.

        and Assessments’ and in the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Method database.

    <li>
        Use of an Issue Based Consulting (PDN) approach for developing issues and hypotheses, is strongly recommended for
        'Develop Assessment Data Package'
    </li>
    <li>
        Where possible, reviews and assessments should be conducted with joint client and IBM teams.
    </li>
    <li>
        The objective is for the assessment to be viewed as a positive activity, which will move the architecture forward
        and assist in its implementation. It should not be seen as a 'witch-hunt', focussing on what is wrong!
    </li>
    <li>
        The assessment findings should always highlight what is good about the architecture, as well as activities to
        further improve its effectiveness.
