    The development of an Enterprise Information Model has several purposes with the exact emphasis and priority depending
    on the nature and objectives of the specific project. The main reasons for developing an Enterprise Information Model
    are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To provide a strategic overview and understanding of the major high-level groups of information needed to manage
        the business and support the processes in the process definitions.
    </li>
    <li>
        To provide architectural parameters and boundaries for subsequent data analysis and data design activities. It sets
        the baseline.
    </li>
    <li>
        To provide high-level planning constructs with respect to the data / information needs of the enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable and support a proper alignment between the key information requirements of the business & its
        partners, with the goals and objectives of the enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable consultants and senior management to explore the constraints on the business and opportunities for, and
        implications of change.
    </li>
    <li>
        To provide a useful vehicle for communication and ownership.

    Enterprise Information Model depicts, in both graphical and textual form, the structure and content of the key
    categories, or "subject areas" of persistent data that need to be managed by the enterprise.
</p>
<p>
    The Enterprise Information Model will usually comprise several separate, but related, components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): showing the network of major entities or groupings of entities (information
        subject areas) and the relationships between them
    </li>
    <li>
        Entity, or information subject area, definitions
    </li>
    <li>
        Relationship Definitions
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Entity Type and Relationship Definitions add detail to the Entity Relationship Diagram by defining all of the
    objects on the diagram.

<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The Enterprise Information Model has many similarities to a "logical data model". Both are interested in identifying
    the information / data that the business manages and both will use a similar graphical notation accompanied with text
    to represent this. The Enterprise Information Model, however, will be at a significantly higher level of abstraction
    and is more concerned with gaining an understanding of the scope and scale of the information that is managed by the
    enterprise. Rather than defining the detailed specifics of any one-subject area, the Enterprise Information Model is
    more focused on knowing that a class of information exists and that it is important.
</p>
<p>
    The Enterprise Information Model, once developed, is highly reusable and will provide the architectural basis for all
    subsequent analysis and requirements projects. The development of logical data models will use the Enterprise
    Information Model as input.
</p><p/><p>
    There is a very strong relationship (or "synergy") between the development of the Enterprise Information Model and the
    business process definition. Many of the activities in the process definition exist primarily to manage the business
    information and each piece of information owes its existence to an activity that creates and manages it. Each of these
    models can be used as input into the development of the other and in most cases they will be developed in parallel and
    by the same people. More detail on how these are developed in parallel is provided in the "Enterprise Information
    Modeling" Technique Paper.
</p>
<p>
    When related to the conceptual framework for Enterprise Information Architectures developed by John Zachman, (see
    references in Reference Section), the Enterprise Information Model represents the "Ballpark" & "Owners" view of the
    data architecture.
</p>
<p>
    While the Enterprise Information Model should cover the full scope of the enterprise, in some engagements this may not
    be possible/feasible, given time constraints, etc. If this is the case a 'limited scope' Enterprise Information Model
    can still be constructed and used as a starting point for further modeling work. (i.e., while the enterprise model can
    be built in pieces, this must be done by extension of a single model and not by the uncoordinated development of
    several separate models).
</p>
<p>
    The Enterprise Information Model can be used in the early stages of software package selection. The high-level subject
    areas can be mapped to the data model of the potential packages to determine, at a high level, the "fit" of the package
    to the enterprise information requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The model must be a good cognitive representation of the strategic information requirements. The business stakeholders,
    including those involved in the development of the model should validate and approve the contents.
