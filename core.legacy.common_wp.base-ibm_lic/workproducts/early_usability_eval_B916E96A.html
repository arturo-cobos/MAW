mental models. As a result of the superior mapping of a conceptual model to the user’s mental models, usability will
improve as evidenced by fewer user errors, shorter learning curve, faster task completion times, and positive responses to
subjective questionnaires and interviews. The usability of the accessibility features will improve when the mapping of the
conceptual model includes mental models from user’s who have disabilities and who use assistive technologies. Since the
evaluation is done early in the design process, changes can be made to the design quickly and easily and at lower expense
since little is invested in significant programming efforts at this point.</td>

    The evaluations can be performed using two different techniques.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In a <strong>cognitive walkthrough</strong>, users step through a proposed interface (e.g. working prototype or
        paper mockup) in the context of specific tasks. As users “walk through” each step to perform a task, they evaluate
        ease of use. This procedure uncovers implicit or explicit assumptions made by developers about users’ knowledge of
        the task and interface conventions. During the cognitive walkthrough, users who are disabled or subject matter
        experts in the assistive technology realm should be invited as participants so that performing a task using
        assistive technologies (such as magnifiers, screen readers, etc.) is “covered.” As the participant steps through
        the prototype, questions about each of the decisions users must make as they use the interface are posed by the
        conductor and answered by the participant. For cognitive walkthroughs, the Early Usability Evaluation work product
        summarizes the users’ feedback and provides recommendations for improving the user interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <strong>heuristic review</strong> involves a human-interface specialist applying a set of guidelines to gauge the
        solution’s usability, pinpoint areas for remediation, and provide recommendations for design change. This
        systematic evaluation is guided by the application of both usability and accessibility principles. Usability
        principles consider error prevention, provision of feedback, consistency, for example. Accessibility principles are
        based on regulation and W3C Web accessibility Guidelines. For heuristic reviews, the Early Usability Evaluation
        work product documents deviations from the guidelines and provides recommendations for addressing
        problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition to these two techniques, a usability test may also be used to evaluate the conceptual model. A formal
    usability test is a controlled evaluation of a solution by users.&nbsp; The test may be conducted in a lab setting,
    using workrooms fitted with one-way glass, video cameras, and a recording station, or at the client location in a work
    area partitioned to provide privacy and avoid distraction.&nbsp; Participants in a usability test are real users who
    perform real tasks using a prototype of the user interface model.&nbsp; The actions and words of participants are
    recorded, typically using audio and video recording equipment.&nbsp; Data logging software is generally used to collect
    time, data, and observer comments.&nbsp; Usability testing is sometimes done with large numbers of users, so user
    interface comparisons can be conducted through statistically-based assessments of task completion times and error
    rates.&nbsp; The Early Usability Evaluation work product is not used to document the results of performing a usability
    test. Rather, the results are presented using a usability test report (and a usability test plan is produced before the
    test).<br />

<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    There are different reasons for running the various forms of usability and accessibility evaluations.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Heuristic reviews and cognitive walkthroughs can be set up more quickly and run more cheaply than most formal usability
    tests. Heuristic reviews are easier to organize and execute than cognitive walkthroughs because they do not require end
    user participation. Research has shown that during early design, a heuristic review can be more effective at
    identifying major usability problems than usability evaluations such as cognitive walkthroughs and usability testing.
    Heuristic reviews, focusing on usability and accessibility principles, can be run any time during conceptual model
    development.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Cognitive walkthroughs provide actual end user feedback, something that the heuristic review approach lacks. They allow
    designers to understand the users’ problems in their own words. Cognitive walkthroughs are likely to occur in the very
    early design stages of the conceptual model, when the user interface is paper-pencil based and two or more conceptual
    models are under investigation.<br />
</p>
<p>
    For all types of Early Usability Evaluations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Evaluation participants should be as representative as possible of the intended users of the system. It is
            important to obtain a set of evaluation participants that mirror as closely as possible the eventual end users
            of the system. Be sure to include participants with as wide a range of abilities and experience as necessary to
            represent the target audience.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The basic rule for selecting usability evaluation scenarios is that they should be chosen on the basis of how
            representative they are of the eventual intended use of the system. During conceptual modeling, the top three
            to eight use cases are used as evaluation tasks. If sufficient code exists, consider doing an early
            accessibility (technical enablement) evaluation at the same time as the early usability evaluation.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The evaluation conductor should be someone who was not involved in the design of the user interface model.
            Every attempt must be made to avoid claims of test bias of any form. Using an independent evaluation conductor
            will help mitigate this potential problem. The early evaluation report should indicate whether the evaluation
            conductor had any involvement in the user interface design.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Discuss recommendations to problems with the project team before they are included in the early evaluation
            report.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Write the report so client executives can understand the evaluation method and procedures, findings, and
            recommendations.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Ensure that important members of the engagement team have reviewed the evaluation report before it is presented
            to the client and that the report meets accessibility standards. See references for an accessible Documentation
            checklist.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Include detailed data in Appendices, not the body of the report. This will make reading easier and more
            focused.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Prepare separate presentation graphics if the evaluation results are to be shared with the&nbsp;stakeholder's orally.
