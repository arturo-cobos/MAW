    The level of detail in which you describe a process is roughly equivalent to the performer level that is being
    considered. You can use the different levels of performers to roll up measurements from the lowest individual level to
    the whole Enterprise. A Performer represents the person, organization, or system performing the work in a process flow.
    Processes can be identified or described at any of the following levels:<br />
    Based on performer level, we can group process models into three general levels of elaboration:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b><i>Inter-organizational</i></b> — A high-level view of the key business processes. Organizational units perform
        these processes. You can use two process models to represent this view. The Decomposition diagram logically groups
        the lower-level processes into key business processes. The Process Flow diagram depicts the relationship between
        the organizational units as work flows through business units. You can align the organizational units either by
        function or by process based on the actual or desired organization. The hierarchy of levels within this performer
        view is important because it serves as the basis for rolling up the process measurements. Typically this Work
        Product Description is used.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><i>Operational</i></b> — A more detailed view of a process, describing the work flows between individuals
        involved in the process. Use the Activity Flow diagram to represent operational processes with the appropriate
        narratives.Typically the process definition work product is used.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><i>Transactional</i></b> — A low-level view of the work performed by each of the individuals within the process.
        You should depict this to a level of detail sufficient to train people and develop the corresponding technology.
        The Activity model, which is typically in the form of a table, can represent this detailed view showing the tasks
        an individual performs with associated links to technology and data.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following table aligns the process decomposition classification with the process elaboration by performer. You
    should align your documentation with the Process categories and treat all of the processes within a Performer level
    identically for the sake of consistency.

</p>
<p>
    The business processes can be represented in a number of ways, depending on the nature of the engagement and
    requirements of the client. In most of the cases a combination of a graphical representation and a textual description
    of the process is used.
</p>
<p>
    Processes may be represented as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Process Hierarchy Diagram (Process Decomposition) 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Block Diagrams
            </li>

    <li>
        Process Narratives

    The Process Narrative documents and describes the detail characteristics of the process and captures additional
    information to support the graphical representation of the process models (decomposition and flow views). The process
    narratives are typically documented at the sub-process level for each process, and describe the steps or activities
    performed by the sub-process. The standard notation for the Process Narrative Description is captured using a text
    table with the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        <b>Process Name</b> – the name of the process

    </li>
    <li dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        <b>Process Description</b> – a narrative description of the overall process and its purpose in sufficient detail

    Some critical success factors for developing this work product include:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Stay at as high a level as possible.&nbsp; Do not waste time developing detailed process models or detailed
        descriptions at this point (include just enough description so people can agree on the boundaries and distinguish
        one process from another).
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the differences between business management functions and processes are understood by IBM and the
        client.
    </li>
    <li>
        The number of businesses' processes should be around twenty to twenty five (if covering the entire enterprise) or
        between six and twelve (if covering the day-to-day business operations area) to achieve the right level of
        granularity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure a reasonably high level of consensus exists among client participants relative to the process names,
        descriptions, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify potential sources of information before any client workshop, e.g., ICM database, ISU "files", subject
        matter experts, competency networks; and through literature searches - competitive intelligence library at Mt.
        Pleasant, NY, Industry benchmark databases, industry consortiums, infogate, internet, etc; and within the client's
        organization in the form of prior work, operating guidelines, ISO or TQM documentation, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare a "straw model" of the processes/descriptions to be defined in the workshop.&nbsp; This is a useful
        technique to ensure proper preparation and insight into the workshop focus area.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whenever possible, start with a generic or industry standard process model (even if the client has his own model)
        to minimize development time and/or use as a benchmark for completeness and clarity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Try to identify and involve the client's "process architect" or a fairly high level staff manager with broad
        knowledge of the client's business (who also understands business processes) to represent an objective view of the
        processes.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Major Dependencies:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Client contact(s) with broad understanding of the business from a process perspective.
    </li>
    <li>
        Involvement of client, vendor or IBM personnel with a general knowledge of the selected package's functional
        capabilities (if applicable).
    </li>
    <li>
        Knowledge of client's key business goals/objectives, customer imperatives and/or business process performance
        issues.

    The notation standard to represent the decomposition view of a process at any level is the process hierarchy
    diagram.&nbsp; A process hierarchy is a particularly useful technique to describe the decomposition of processes since
    it allows you to model a business unit with minimal effort. These models are easily constructed and changed as you
    learn more the business operations.
</p>
<p>
    From the process hierarchy model representation, summarized representations of the process decomposition view can be
    developed to communicate the processes to various audiences:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The block diagram is a good notation to use in executive presentations to show the relationship between groups of
        processes. This type of illustration is very simple and it shows the decomposition view.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The value chain diagram is another useful notation technique for use in executive presentations to show those
        processes that are key to providing "value-add" to customers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The concept of value chains is that it shows how an order or a request from the customer can be traced throughout the
    organization. It can also show how information flows within the organization. This notation can be used when the
    primary emphasis on the project is to eliminate non-value add activities – In such cases, this view would identify the
    high level processes and sub processes which can be explored in detail to eliminate non-value add activities.
