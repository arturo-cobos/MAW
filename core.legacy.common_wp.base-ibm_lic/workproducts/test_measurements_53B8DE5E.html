        effective areas and areas requiring improvements will be identified. If the measurements show that the team was
        better than the enterprise current best practice, then the project should be examined to explain how this

<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Keep the Test Measurements simple and meaningful.&nbsp; Measurements that are easily understood, collected, analyzed
    and presented will be more readily created and accepted.&nbsp; Many academic publications provide complex statistical
    algorithms for calculating and reporting Test Measurements.&nbsp; However unless the Testing organization is highly
    complex (many heterogeneous technologies, complex applications and external interfaces, sharing of data across numerous
    lines of business, distributed teams, etc), it is best to maintain a simple set of measurements that are cost-effective
    to produce, analyze and use.
</p>
<p>
    There exist in the marketplace many Testing tools that provide the facility to gather Test Measurements during dynamic
    testing.&nbsp; The choice of tool will depend on the underlying technology of the applications being tested and the ROI
    expected by the organization on this investment.&nbsp; It may be preferable when initiating a Test Measurements
    program, to use a spreadsheet to capture the metrics and to graph them as “prototypes” until Test Management decides
    what information is required to be gathered.&nbsp; The findings can then be used as criteria for acquisition of Testing
    tools to manage the management information most supportive of the Testing organization’s objectives.
</p>
<p>
    It may be beneficial to measure Defect Rate against Development Productivity (metrics from the Application domain), as
    the inefficiencies may not always lie within the Testing function.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <em>[Rubin and Ed Yourdon conducted an international study of software development productivity and quality for the
    federal department industry Canada. The study involved 227 companies in the United States, South America, Europe, South
    Africa, The Far East, and India. The study found that Canadian software developers were much more productive than the
    worldwide average. They accounted for 111 function points per developer compared to the worldwide average of 92.5
    function points per developer. The results also indicated that Canada had the highest defect rate, 5.12 defects per
    thousand lines of code. The worldwide average is 3.79 defects per thousand lines of code. The United States had the
    overall lowest defect rate, 2.3 defects per thousand lines of code.&nbsp; The study supports the hypothesis that the
    faster you write software the more defects you make. The United States which had the lowest defect rate creates
    software at an average (88 function points per developer) slightly lower that the worldwide average.]</em>
</p>
<p>
    Detailed information on how to classify defects (for process improvements and root cause analysis) using a
    standardized, rigidly defined categorization technique, may be found at <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/softeng/ODC/ODC.HTM">http://www.research.ibm.com/softeng/ODC/ODC.HTM</a>.&nbsp; At
    present the examples on these pages are geared towards the development of systems software, but the analogy can be
    adopted for application development.&nbsp; The IBM Testing Competency is currently investigating the inclusion of this
    technique into the IBM Global Services Method – Testing Subdomain.
</p>
<p>
    Some additional suggested industry-standard Testing Metrics and Measurements may be found by referring to the ISO
    standard – ISO-9126, but caution is advised in their adoption as it could become a lengthy and costly program.
