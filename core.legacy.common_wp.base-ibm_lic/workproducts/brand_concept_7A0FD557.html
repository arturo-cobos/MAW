Its primary purpose is to provide a unified approach that will provide standards and consistencies across all media and
establish the market position of the company, its products and services with its customers. This consistency reinforces the
perceived value of the brand in the marketplace. A Brand Concept provides the design team with valuable input that will
help them develop user interfaces consistent with the brand image.</td>

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    A company’s brand is its reputation in the marketplace.&nbsp; Careful attention must be paid to portraying the brand as
    accurately as possible in a public environment.&nbsp; If the application’s functionality, execution, and look and feel
    are inconsistent with the Brand Concept, the brand will be diluted, impacting the company’s reputation in the
    marketplace.
</p>
<p>
    Top executives usually can verify their company’s Brand Concept.&nbsp; For individual products and services, line
    managers will often be the brand experts.&nbsp; The marketing organization within a company should also be able to
    offer expertise on the Brand Concepts for the overall company brand and/or any separately branded products and
    services.
</p>
<p>
    When the Brand Concept is new, or in the process of changing, it is prudent to test the ideas with external sources who
    may be potential targets of the brand.&nbsp; This testing is often conducted by market research organizations.&nbsp;
    Brand Concepts may be tested with focus groups and through online surveys.&nbsp; Special procedures apply to these
    activities.

    Brand Concepts are documented as strategic requirements.&nbsp; They include the identification of market position and
    market differentiation, competitive products and services, target audiences segmentation, and the emotional and
    cognitive experience the brand should represent.&nbsp; Brand agencies typically use a combination of unique creative
    approaches that vary in their presentation and documentation to portray strategic messages, concept, or concept design
    and animatics and demographic or psychographic documentation to communicate Brand Concepts.
