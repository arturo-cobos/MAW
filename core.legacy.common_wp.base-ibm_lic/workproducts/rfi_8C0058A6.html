work product is a brief, expedient document designed to focus on vendor products that may suit the organization's software
needs Some RFI’s are distributed and responded to via electronic mail due to the necessity of a quick response. This work

application software suite, an operating system or platform, or a sophisticated software tool).</td>

    The RFI is usually a&nbsp;document that typically includes the following sections:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Title Page</strong>: A title page for the RFI should be created to display the&nbsp;organizaion name, logo
        and project name as well as the date of release to the vendors.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Table of Contents</strong>: A table of contents should be developed to assist ease of use for the vendor.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Project Background</strong>: The project background provides an overview of the business focus and the
        business areas within scope of the software selection.&nbsp;It usually provides a brief overview of the selection
        project and other initiative that affect the selection.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Procedures and Rules</strong>: A brief description outline of the selection process, its timeline and major
        milestones are provided.&nbsp;The response format is informal and allows the vendor to respond quickly with their
        product and service information.&nbsp;A request for specific information should be prepared to best evaluate the
        vendor offerings.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Response Content</strong>: This section outlines what information is desired from the vendor.&nbsp;It
        should emphasize that the RFI seeks information on the vendor’s product, its functionality and technical details
        rather than marketing related materials.&nbsp;It is often necessary to require electronic responses due to time
        constraints.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Key Contacts</strong>: This section should identify the key contacts for the vendor.&nbsp;It should provide
        names, addresses, and phone and fax numbers as well as e-mail addresses.&nbsp;The key contact section indicates who
        will administer the RFI, answer vendor questions and establishes a clear communication vehicle for the vendor.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Background</strong>: This section should supply any background information that will assist the vendor in
        responding to the RFI.&nbsp;This may include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Known Constraints (usually technical)
            </li>
            <li>
                Business Volumes or Metrics

<div class="sectionHeading">Key Considerations</div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The RFI should focus the vendor on the client’s business needs and provide an expedient method for the vendor to supply
    information about their products and services.&nbsp; It should provide as much information as possible to assist the
    vendor, but not be so lengthy as to hinder a rapid response.&nbsp; For an average size engagement this document should
    be no more than 5-6 pages.&nbsp; Client security and privacy requirements must be considered when working through the
    RFI process.&nbsp; Any security information developed in prior activities should be considered when creating the
    documentation sent to vendors.
</p>
<p>
    Questions must be designed to uncover the desired information.&nbsp; For example, suppose a future process attribute of
    the “produce invoice” process is “VAT computation.”&nbsp; A question must be designed to elicit the information.&nbsp;
    The quality of the information discovered by an RFI response document is dependent upon
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The specificity of the question
    </li>
    <li>
        The design of the question
    </li>
    <li>
        The integrity of the responder
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ambiguous questions often elicit vague or misleading responses.&nbsp; It is important to phrase the questions to elicit
    concrete answers.&nbsp; Consider the difference in the style and specificity of the following questions:
</p>
<p>
    GENERAL
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Question: Does the package support international tax computations?
    </li>
    <li>
        Answer: Yes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    SPECIFIC
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Question: Does the package support value-added tax on invoices?
    </li>
    <li>
        Answer: Yes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    SPECIFIC WITH CONTEXT
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Question: Goods are to be shipped to a British customer by a warehouse located in France.&nbsp; Describe how the
        package will correctly charge Value Added Tax (VAT) on the invoice.&nbsp; Describe how the package will correctly
        track the amount of tax to be remitted to British tax authorities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Answer: On the invoice, VAT will be shown on the bottom of the invoice based on the value of French content added
        to the product.&nbsp; The VAT rate is taken from a user maintained table.&nbsp; The amount of the remittance due
        the British government is tracked in a sub-ledger in the Accounts Payable module.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Poorly designed questions will damage the integrity of the evaluation, since the answers may not be consistent with the
    intent of the question.&nbsp; It is also important to design the questions to drive answers consistent with the rating
    scale; it may even be useful to have the rating scales devised in advance of wording the questions.&nbsp; It is not a
    good idea to reveal the rating scale to the responding vendors.
</p>
<p>
    The organization of the document can be in the same manner as the source of the questions: by process, by technical
    category, by vendor qualification category.
</p>
<p>
    So not to waste vendor’s time and effort in responding, if there are mandatory compliance requirements, eg Enterprise
    Standards, Security subsystems - these need to be clearly stated as such.
</p>
<p>
    The rating scale should be completed after the project team has had time to review the vendor responses in
    detail.&nbsp; The rating scale might be completed by each team member, and then consolidated in a workshop.
</p>
<p>
    Some required data (such as ease of use, etc.) does not lend itself to a question/answer format.&nbsp; It is important
    that the data gathering strategy is matched correctly with the type of data to be gathered.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure that all non-IBM vendor contact is conducted through the Client in order to avoid misunderstandings.
</p>
<p>
    If possible, conduct independent research on the proposed vendors and their suggested solutions.&nbsp; Make the Client
    aware of any issues that may be uncovered through your research, through feedback from User Groups, or other sources.
</p>
<p>
    Keep the overall project timeline in focus during the RFI cycle.&nbsp; The time between issuing the request, responding
    to requests for clarifications to questions, and receipt of answers may put this item on the critical path.
</p>
<p>
    The Request for Information should be confined to the scope of the project Statement of Work (SOW).&nbsp;<br />

    There would not be any commonality in the specifications given to different vendors, and it would become difficult to
    compare responses and other information that is available about competing products.
</p>
<p>
    Elimination of the Request for Information may hinder the selection process for engagements that are focused on "best
    of breed", niche markets or for situations with less standardized vendor offerings. As a result, the project team may
    demonstrate vendor software that may not match the&nbsp;future business requirements or they may eliminate other
    vendors who would better satisfy those future business requirements.
