    The scope of the Business Case work product addresses economic considerations associated with project recommendations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All identified "hard" benefits to the business, using an accepted, balanced and consistent financial evaluation
        approach
    </li>
    <li>
        "Soft" benefits to the business, selected from among those identified
    </li>
    <li>
        Selected "Quick Hit" benefits to the client that can be identified and claimed based on the project, which may or
        may not be solely due to the implementation of the recommendation
    </li>
    <li>
        The timing and order of recognizing benefits, based on a high-level implementation plan
    </li>
    <li>
        The costs of the recommendation, including (but not limited to) hardware, software and services, based on best
        available information

    <li>
        All assumptions used in calculating the costs, benefits and schedule
    </li>

    The <b>Business Case</b> development process is iterative and continuous throughout the project. The <b>Business
    Case</b> outlines how actual benefits or results can be measured, compared to existing metrics and benefits claimed, as
    recommendations associated with each business process or function are implemented.

    Management of the <b>Business Case</b> is extremely important. The <b>Business Case</b> is usually the primary
    documentation for the justification of the project’s recommendations and the method the client will use to measure the
    ultimate benefits of adopting those recommendations versus the current baseline. As such, it is essential to involve
    the client in all aspects of <b>Business Case</b>. Early in the <b>Business Case</b> task, the Project Manager should
    meet with the Client Team Manager and appropriate “client financial personnel”, to identify accepted client financial
    measurements and calculation techniques; appropriate areas for consideration, as well as areas for non-consideration
    and proper client personnel contacts and procedures. One of the main areas for non-consideration may be any claimed
    labor-savings if there is no reduction in headcount. This must be discussed with the client management before
    allocating resources to the calculations. Many times this type of labor cost saving is included as a “soft” benefit in
    the <b>Business Case</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Business Case</strong> must be validated by the project team, as well as by client management and financial
    personnel.&nbsp; Attention should be paid to the <strong>Business Case</strong> being consistent with the design and
    implementation of the future ("Future") business processes.&nbsp; The Project Manager must gain client agreement on the
    validation process early in the <strong>Business Case</strong> task.&nbsp; Any claimed benefits should have appropriate
    client management sign-off as to the amount, timing and beneficiary area.&nbsp; Lacking a true sign-off, the client
    management team must agree that the benefits are reasonable and obtainable, and this agreement must be detailed in the
    report.&nbsp; Sometimes the facts outlined in the assumptions will change, causing the benefits to vary; however the
    client still expects the benefits to remain constant.&nbsp; Only by accurately capturing and maintaining current
    assumptions, consistent with the final calculations, can client expectations be managed.

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Impact of not having</th><td class="sectionTableCell">A <b>Business Case</b> is usually required, depending on the needs and desires of the client, and therefore will usually be
developed. Without a documented <b>Business Case</b>, the risk is great that decisions, identified benefits and
assumptions, which were once very clear and well understood, will be lost, forgotten or distorted by the time actual
benefits can be claimed. Typically, after the decision to proceed with the implementation of the transformation project is
made, all thoughts of benefits are forgotten until after the system is up and running, the personnel trained, the multitude
of procedures resolved, and the hectic pace of implementation normalized. Many of the justifications are based on tough
business decisions on how to restructure an organization or function, at times causing displacement of people. Without the
<b>Business Case</b> to solidly identify these decisions and agreements, client personnel may not act and benefits may not
accrue to the project. Many times, the earlier knowledge is lost, and the benefits, cost and schedule need to be redone,
involving additional cost, time and effort so that the client can calculate the benefits. A well-documented <b>Business
Case</b> eliminates this effort by preserving all of the original thoughts, plans, calculations, assumptions and
agreements.

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>The <b>Business Case</b> can also identify "Quick Hit" opportunities and claim their contribution to the benefits
of the project. Sometimes client personnel know what should be done to improve their organization and processes, however
the momentum of daily business, the threat of unpopular decisions, the lack of people to put it into action, the inertia of
the organization, needed simultaneous improvements in other processes, a lack of vision, or any number of other reasons can
cause the client organization not to act upon it. By incorporating these improvements into the <b>Business Case</b>, the
benefits can be claimed by the project, the various processes can be improved and the client personnel can gain recognition
as strong contributors. A plus from the project perspective is that a "quick hit" can usually be accomplished very early in
the project, many times before implementation, thus improving greatly the attractiveness of cash flow calculations.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    A <b>Business Case</b>, while of primary importance in most projects, may be of minimal importance in others. Examples
    of these instances of minor importance could be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The client must replace a system or reengineer a process for non-financial business reasons, and does not feel the
        need for additional expenditure to justify the decision (e.g., the existing does not meet regulatory requirements
        and must be replaced, changing business requirements forces the replacing of the existing system to meet customer
        needs, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        The client has already allocated funds for the project and chooses not to spend additional funds for "unnecessary"
        justification.
    </li>
    <li>
        The client chooses not to cause employee or organizational unrest by highlighting benefits that would cause
        efficiency-driven layoffs of personnel (e.g., the identification of labor related savings in a union environment,
        etc.).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In many of these situations, the <b>Business Case</b> may still be used as a management summary and reporting
    mechanism, but lack the strong emphasis on financial justification. All of this must be discussed and agreed upon with
    the client prior to the definition and costing of the project.
