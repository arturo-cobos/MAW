    This work product provides the foundation and much of the material for many other business modeling and system
    development work products.&nbsp; Additional reasons for creating this work product include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Anticipating information systems requirements. Experience has demonstrated that the more application functionality
        is provided, the more users demand. We can get out in front of this requirements gap by anticipating user needs
        before they materialize by understanding common patterns of semantic structure
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoiding a focus on technological plumbing at the expense of the business content of the system being built
    </li>
    <li>
        Removing the limitations of programming-based and engineering-based analysis paradigms. The Classified Business
        Terms word product supports a rigorous understanding of the meaning of business terms without clouding the issue
        with object-oriented or database design concepts
    </li>
    <li>
        Expressing other work products (requirements, business processes and events, business rules, business object
        models, use cases, user interface and database designs) in terms understandable to the customer
    </li>
</ul><p/>The overarching goal of business language analysis is to ensure that the right thing is built for the customer in a way
that supports the customer’s current and future information needs. Information system solutions should be built with a
fundamental appreciation for the meaning and intent of business communications. Creating a set of Classified Business Terms
forces the development team to listen to the customer effectively. It is an intensive effort to understand how the business
people think and what they are concerned with. This work product resolves conflicting, ambiguous business language used by
different work groups and organizations that need to reach a common understanding in their use of automated information
systems.</td>

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Main Description</th><td class="sectionTableCell">The terms are classified and grouped according to the more generic business concepts.&nbsp; At the highest level, the types
of classification include things like resources, results or products, locations, processes, events, time, roles,
organizations, etc.&nbsp; Resources can generally be subclassified as physical resources, monetary resources, information
resources, energy, and capabilities.&nbsp; The generic subclassification can continue, with information resources being
classified as measurements, identifiers, history, etc. 
<p>
    The following is a useful starting set of concepts that apply quite generally to almost any business in the process of
    classifying the language used in that domain:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Person
    </li>
    <li>
        Organization
    </li>
    <li>
        Role
    </li>
    <li>
        Resource
    </li>
    <li>
        Capability
    </li>
    <li>
        Physical resource
    </li>
    <li>
        Energy
    </li>
    <li>
        Monetary resource
    </li>

        Rule
    </li>
    <li>
        Relationship
    </li>
    <li>
        Agreement
    </li>
    <li>
        Account
    </li>
    <li>
        Measurement
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifier
    </li>
    <li>
        Result
    </li>
    <li>
        Product

    <li>
        Service

    <li>
        Task
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Event
    </li>
    <li>
        Location

</ul>
<p>
    This high-level set of business concepts forms the basis of the classification of business terms.&nbsp; The example
    below shows how a few of these classifications have been used with a small sample of terminology from a business case
    study.
</p></td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Brief Outline</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    The Classified Business Terms work product consists of words and phrases that are actually used in the business area
    under study, classified and grouped by generic concepts that apply across businesses.
</p>
<p>
    The basic form is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Classification
    </li>
    <li>
        Term
    </li>
    <li>
        Another term
    </li>
    <li>
        Still another term
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As the set of terms grows and the knowledge of the business area increases, there are two refinements that can be made
    to the basic notation.&nbsp; One is that more refined and specific classifications can be introduced within the
    high-level generic classifications.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Classification 
        <ul>
            <li>
                A subclassification
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Term 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Another term
            </li>
            <li>
                Still another term
            </li>
            <li>
                Another subclassification
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Term 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Another term
            </li>
            <li>
                Still another term
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The other refinement is to recognize variations on the terms themselves, which focuses attention on specific
    distinctions of meaning in the business (and points to possible classes and subclasses of business objects).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Classification 
        <ul>
            <li>
                A subclassification
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Term 
        <ul>

<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    It is important to create Classified Business Terms as early as possible in the project, before designers have locked
    themselves into a set of abstractions invented without the benefit of real business terminology.
</p><p/><p>
    Involve client personnel in analyzing the business language to ensure that the benefits of increased mutual
    understanding are fully realized.&nbsp; It is imperative that this includes business owners and systems users, not just
    client IS people.
</p>
<p>
    Before beginning a business language analysis, exercise the engagement team should conduct a thorough search of IBM’s
    intellectual capital databases for any existing Classified Business Terms that may apply, either because they are in
    the same industry domain or are related to a similar functional or application area.
</p>
<p>
    Business language analysis is intrinsically an activity of validation and verification.&nbsp; It firmly grounds the
    whole business model and resulting solutions in the business domain.&nbsp; Some of the linkages and traceabilities that
    build on business language analysis include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Completion Criteria:&nbsp;A key strength of the business terms approach is that it is relatively
        deterministic.&nbsp; There are some straightforward tests that can be applied to determine that the Classified
        Business Terms list is complete and accurate for the business domain.&nbsp;These tests include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                All key client personnel have validated completeness of the sources used to build business language models
            </li>
            <li>
                Terminology is converging–fewer and fewer new business terms are discovered in either written sources or
                conversations with domain experts
            </li>
            <li>
                Terms have been completely classified by business concepts
            </li>
            <li>
                New concepts have been incorporated into the classification scheme
            </li>
            <li>
                Quality Criteria - A business person should be able to validate that the terms are meaningful to the
                business and are properly classified.
