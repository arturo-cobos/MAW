        A means to quickly relate to referenced concepts such as enterprise mission, vision, goals etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Frame of reference for direction and prioritization setting, as well as guidance for business strategy formulation
        and execution, including:
    </li>
    <li>
        Clarity and focus on what is important for competitive performance.
    </li>
    <li>
        An insight into, and a high level starting point for, the key business processes and information needed to manage
        the business.
    </li>
    <li>
        Market positioning and a view of the competition to clarify goals. For example, what will it take for this
        enterprise to be a leader in their market space and how will that increase market share, employee satisfaction,
        ease of recruitment, etc…?
    </li>
    <li>
        A clear understanding of current gaps and respective resolutions to enable successful attainment of goals.
    </li>
    <li>
        Useful criteria for evaluating the relative contribution of proposed initiatives and investments.
    </li>
    <li>
        A baseline for prioritization of projects and programs in order to better utilize limited resources.

<ul>

    </li>
    <li>
        An agreed upon basis for strategic decisions that will have to be made during the project.

    <li>
        A means for assessment of success of the project.

From a security perspective, it is important to understand the goals of the company in order to determine what challenges
security may face. If the business is planning on expanding into a new country, assessments and evaluations need to be made
to ensure that the business is protected from any potential threats of that expansion. Security can also prioritize its
focus on drivers of the organization.</td>

    A '<i>high-level</i>’ understanding is gained of what the enterprise is and aspires to become, how it intends to
    achieve its goals and make the desired transition and by what means. What is included in the business direction depends
    upon the nature of the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    At a minimum, the company's vision, mission, goals and strategic direction should be understood and documented. It is
    often enough to provide guidance for analysis and alignment of any functional area of a company, including IT, and to
    provide prioritization criteria for initiatives, programs, projects and even modules of a technology package. This is
    because good vision, mission, goal statements and strategic direction usually identify a future view, a description of
    types of offerings and customers, and means to achieve the desired outcome.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, value propositions, required capabilities and key resources to enable a capability, are replacing the use
    of traditional strategic concepts like Critical Success Factors and Distinctive Competencies.

    Challenge the management team's statements on measurability and feasibility.
</p>
<p>
    Very often, Business goals, and CSF's are not well defined.&nbsp; If this is the case try to convince the management
    team to work on this as their preparation to the Business Focus Workshop.&nbsp; MetaPlan can really help doing this
    effectively and efficiently.
</p>
<p>
    Find out how a business direction process is used in the organization.&nbsp; Find out what management layers have
    influence on a mission, goals, strategy, CSF’s and key performance indicators (KPI) process. Is it a yearly process or
    dynamic, used or put away in a bottom drawer? How is the terminology used?
</p>
<p>
    Find out if the Management team – especially the members of the HR and marketing organizations – are familiar with
    accessibility standards for their on-line information and services.&nbsp; While your customer may not be under a
    government regulation requiring that it makes its information and services accessible, customers with e-business models
    may recognize substantial brand value from ensuring that their information, services and business processes are
    accessible.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, where e-Government and e-business are gaining momentum, the accessibility of information and services is
    shifting from solely a regulatory mandate to an explicit element of the organization’s vision and mission.
</p><p/><p>
    <strong><em>Note:</em></strong>&nbsp; With the increasing degrees of uncertainty brought on by e-business,
    practitioners might wish to familiarize themselves with Stephan Haeckel's book Adaptive Enterprise.&nbsp; Traditional
    concepts regarding strategic direction will be profoundly tested and practitioners should be aware of the changes and
    be able to articulate a required strategy in the new information economy brought on by e-business.&nbsp; The following
    are excerpts from the introduction and first chapter of this book.
</p>
<p>
    <em>In the information economy brought on by e-business, traditional content within vision, mission, goals etc. is
    changing rapidly and successful companies are articulating strategic directions from a "sense & respond"
    perspective, rather than a "make and sell" perspective, meaning that strategic directions should be based on a highly
    anticipative modular organization with mechanisms that rapidly identify what a customer believes are of value instead
    of trying to predict what customers want, making it and then pushing it to them.&nbsp; The latter is that structure
    follows strategy rather than strategy as structure.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Over time, companies will create a "context" that unambiguously establishes what the firm does and the constraints
    for how it does it.&nbsp; Leaders will specify how employees interrelate to achieve an organization's purpose.&nbsp;
    The elements of the "context" thus established can be seen as analogous to the traditional concepts of mission, policy
    and organization, but with some important differences.&nbsp; As long as the employees stay within the parameters
    defined by the context, the business empowers them to determine for themselves how best to deliver results for which
    they have been made accountable.&nbsp; The result is that context and coordination replace traditional command and
    control.&nbsp; As individuals in the organization adapt to differing customer requests, always staying within the
    current organizational context, leadership actively seeks out environmental and internal signals that will help it
    improve the organizational context itself.&nbsp; What happens is that the sense and respond alternative implies a
    different way in expressing strategy.&nbsp; Once a company organizes itself to recognize current customer needs and
    responds to them, it no longer operates from a strategic plan.&nbsp; Now the DESIGN of its systematic capability to
    respond to unanticipated customer requests expresses its strategy (strategy as a structure as opposed to traditional
    strategic direction where structure follows strategy a process which now takes too long to effectively respond in the
    information economy of e-business).</em>
</p>
<p>
    Be aware of the language and notation that the client’s organization is using. While this work product uses commonly
    accepted definitions, the terms vision, mission, goals etc. are often used slightly differently.
</p>
<p>
    The company’s culture, structure, maturity or economic positions all define the client’s business direction. The
    strategic direction should ultimately be "grounded": we consider it to be grounded when it is cascaded throughout the
    organization, processes and functions and is proactively managed.

</table>The danger is that the new business will not have the appropriate focus, or not impose the required changes.
Changes might be driven solely by a technology specialist selecting specific technologies or by business engineers changing
processes without a keen understanding of the implications of the technology on the business direction.

        It will have no (or very little) impact on the achievement of the&nbsp;business goals (e.g. when the objective of
        the business solution selection and implementation is to solve an IT issue only).

<p>
    However, even in this case, a clear business direction for the disconnected part of the business is important. It is
    strongly recommended that all engagements and projects should be embedded in the overall business direction. Integral
    management of all parts of the business is essential today.
