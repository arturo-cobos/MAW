    The primary purpose of the User Interface Guidelines is to ensure user interface design consistency across solutions
    and projects. Users interacting with a similar “look and feel” within and across solutions and systems provide
    consistency and give the user the advantage of not having to learn a new way of interacting with the system. The User
    Interface Design Guidelines are also used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Early in design as a reference for guiding broad high-level design decisions pertaining to the use of metaphors for
        capturing the user’s mental model of tasks and processes in the user interface conceptual model.
    </li>
    <li>
        Later in design as a reference for guiding detailed low-level design decisions pertaining to the selection and use
        of windows, menus, and other widgets and user interface controls (e.g., entry fields, window titles, group boxes,
        and push buttons).
    </li>
    <li>
        During the development of user interface code by programmers as a reference for guiding the development of user
        interface design intricacies that are sometimes not captured in a user interface design specification. These design
        specifics may include the selection of mnemonics for push buttons and menu items and the identification of
        accelerator keys for lists, buttons, and menus.
    </li>
    <li>
        After the code has been written and testing is underway by systems assurance to perform an objective quality review
        aimed at assessing the consistency of the user interface.

    The User Interface Guidelines work product usually comes in the form of a (set of) document(s), with separate entries
    for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Company-wide user interface design guidelines
    </li>
    <li>
        System-specific user interface design guidelines
    </li>
    <li>
        Project-specific user interface design guidelines
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It typically contains a reference to (not a copy of) certain widely accepted industry standards (such as the Microsoft
    Windows User Interface Guidelines or the IBM Common User Access guidelines).&nbsp; The industry standard reference may
    also be supplemented with a set of external regulations and standards, such as ISO (International Standards
    Organization) concerning display and keyboard standards for character width and height, display brightness and
    contrast, and keyboard key placement.&nbsp; In addition, the User Interface Design Guidelines work product explicitly
    documents mandatory, recommended, discouraged, and bad practices based on the most frequent types of errors that are
    made against this standard and the specific types of systems that are being built across the organization.
</p>
<p>
    Within the same company, different classes of applications may require a further refinement of the User Interface
    Design Guidelines.&nbsp; For example, retail kiosk applications in a bank will be used by actual customers and will
    therefore have higher usability and accessibility requirements than traditional transaction-oriented applications used
    by the retail bank’s employees.&nbsp; The latter can be trained; the former cannot.&nbsp; Simply because the retail
    kiosk is a different style of interface, there may be some different or additional guidelines.&nbsp; Thus, User
    Interface Design Guidelines may be applied across projects or across an application suite as a means to ensure
    enterprise-wide user interface design consistency.<br />

    Typical contents include the following:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Industry Standard Adherence</strong><br />
    This section specifies the industry standard that will be adhered to by default.&nbsp; It should include details about
    where to find and how to access this information (books, CD-ROMs, Web addresses, and so on).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>General User Interface Principles<br />
    </strong>This section contains some general user interface principles that are applicable for any type of user
    interface on any platform.&nbsp; Principles of accessibility for alternative access to information may be considered in
    this section.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Design Methodology</strong><br />
    This section describes a user-centered design process.&nbsp; It includes discussion of requirements gathering,
    designing through low- and high-fidelity prototyping, and iterative refinement based on usability evaluation.&nbsp; It
    will discuss, at a high level, techniques for usability, accessibility, and other evaluations including cognitive
    walk-throughs, heuristic review, and other engineering approaches to usability evaluation.&nbsp; It may also discuss
    laboratory-based usability testing, accessibility testing, and measurements, such as ability to complete task, time on
    task, and measures of error.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Component Guidelines<br />
    </strong>This section discusses the tailoring of the industry standard style guide for support of the solution.&nbsp;
    It will also describe specific guidelines for new components developed for the solution.&nbsp; For each component, two
    categories of compliance are often identified.
</p>
<p>
    The first, typically called <strong>Required</strong>, denotes guidelines that absolutely must be observed to comply
    with corporate standards. These may also include government regulations and the client’s policies. The second category,
    typically called <strong>Recommended</strong>, contains guidelines that should be adhered to if possible, but do not
    violate the standards if ignored.

<div class="sectionHeading">Key Considerations</div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Illustrate your guidelines with examples showing compliance with a particular guideline. Show examples of noncompliance
    if the guideline is easy to violate or difficult to communicate easily. People sometimes learn more from bad examples
    than from good examples.
</p>
<p>
    Be judicious in deviating from common, accepted industry standards, especially in the first release of an application.
    If you choose to deviate, provide a paper trail documenting the reasons for the deviation. Ideally, the reason for the
    deviation is based on specialized usability or data element requirements, and its tailoring is justified on the basis
    of usability test findings.
</p>
<p>
    Appoint a style guide “czar” who is responsible for developing the User Interface Guidelines, reviewing user interface
    designs before they are completely implemented, and ensuring compliance with the guidelines. This person is sometimes
    not all that popular, so he or she should have the fortitude to ensure that the guidelines are adhered to, even in the
    face of strong opposition.
</p>
<p>
    Make the User Interface Guidelines usable for the developer. Do not put a 300-page document on the developer’s desk
    that he/she is expected to read entirely before designing the first screen. Consider placing the style guide on the
    intranet, providing hyperlinks to allow developers to download style guide demos if they exist. If you use the document
    format, make sure to provide an index at the end of the document.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on how much tailoring is required, a solution-specific set of guidelines may be anywhere from 20 to 200 pages
    in length.
</p>
<p>
    Check that all guidelines are either very explicit or have references to documents or standards.
</p>
<p>
    Involve an accessibility expert and users who have disabilities in the review process.
</p>
<p>
    Involve the user through user reviews, discussions of examples, and/or prototyping of standard layouts and
    interactions.
</p>
<p>
    Involve the developers by means of developer reviews. You should aim to create a feeling among the developers that the
    User Interface Guidelines are <i>their</i> User Interface Guidelines. If developers are not involved and/or disagree,
    you will encounter problems enforcing the use of the guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    Call for a review by an expert from outside the project team. Getting the view of someone outside the team gives you
    some other approaches and perspectives. This should be someone who has expert knowledge of the industry standard and
    who has a background in usability engineering.
</p>
<p>
    Verify external regulations and environmental style guides such as ANSI (American National Standards Institute) or ISO.
    Are there any legally imposed threshold values on the size of a character on a screen, the brightness of a display, the
    use of certain terminology?
</p>
<p>
    Ensure that the guidelines are technically achievable in the target environment. If a certain guideline currently
    cannot be implemented in a straightforward fashion, if possible, describe a workaround to the guideline. If not,
    document the fact that the guideline does not apply to this release.
</p><p/>This activity is often “meeting-intensive” especially if a task force is set up to adopt “company-wide” standards. Try to
handle as much task force communication via e-mail as possible, and try to limit the occurrence of time-consuming,
potentially unproductive, in-person meetings. Be very selective in staffing this effort if the client insists upon creating
the task force.</td>

    If this work product is not developed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The user interface is likely to be inconsistent in look, feel, and conceptual model, and end users may make more
        errors or take longer to perform tasks because of these inconsistencies. Users will also require a longer training
        period to become proficient using the system because inconsistencies in the user interface require users to learn
        more procedures for performing tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Electronic performance support aids such as online tutorials, coaches, and wizards may need to be developed to
        compensate for the inconsistent design and to help users learn how to master the inconsistencies of the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Software engineers will develop conflicting designs for similar functions, and time and resources will be needed to
        resolve these inconsistent design approaches. These inconsistent implementations frequently cause accessibility
        problems, requiring further resources and time to resolve.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rather than reuse approved design and code, developers will create their own idiosyncratic designs and code,
        resulting in the need for more testing (since more test cases have to be developed) and potentially greater defects
        in the code.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<p>
    The solution team can compensate for the absence of this work product by scheduling more up front training for users
    and developing electronic performance support systems to augment the user interface. Without a user interface design
    guide, the development team can compensate by building more time and resources into the schedule to resolve
    inconsistent user interface designs and respond to defect reports associated with the inconsistencies in the user
    interface.
