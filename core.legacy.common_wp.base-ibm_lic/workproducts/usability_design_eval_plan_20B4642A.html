    The first stage of an evaluation is to develop an evaluation plan. Without a comprehensive evaluation plan, you will
    not be able to be thorough or organized in your evaluation and will have a much harder time gathering and interpreting
    data.
</p>
<p>
    You should address most of the basic issues as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Introduction and Background</b>--Introduce the general plan and provide any necessary background information on
        the project or learners.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Purpose</b>--What do you want to get out of this evaluation? What are you goals? You can have multiple purposes,
        but make sure that they are each clearly defined and that you’re not trying to gather too much information at one
        time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Limitations</b>--What are you going to exclude in this evaluation process? Will you come back to some of these
        issues later?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Audience</b>--Who are the people participating in the evaluation? Have they already agreed to be involved or do
        you need to recruit them? How willing or unwilling are they? Do you need to provide any incentives? Is the
        accessibility audience included?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Decisions</b>--What kinds of decisions will be affected by the evaluation? Are there any decisions that you will
        not be changing, no matter what the result of the evaluation?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Methods</b>--Specify the evaluation design and procedure. Who will be recording data and how will they do it?
        How will you use the feedback you receive? Develop the questions you will be asking during the evaluation, as well
        as any forms, tests, tasks, or surveys that you want the participants to complete.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Logistics</b>--Which of your team members will be participating? Do you need to bring in any outside assistance?
        Do you have the proper space for the evaluation (including computers, projector and screen, or any other technical
        equipment you may need)? Are there accessibility needs (such as large print documents or sign language
        interpretation) that must be met? This is the time to order any supplies you need, make sure everyone on your team
        can attend, and go through all the logistical elements of running the evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Timeline</b>--If possible, evaluate early and often. Provide a schedule for each evaluation you want to
        complete, allowing sufficient time for analyzing the data you receive and making changes to the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Budget</b>--How much will this evaluation cost? Consider supplies, participant incentives, room and equipment
        rentals, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After you’ve created your evaluation plan, you should be well prepared to successfully complete your evaluation.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Brief Outline</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    This artifact&nbsp;consists primarily of sections of text with some tables based on&nbsp;the following standard
    headings:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Introduction:</strong> This section provides a description and purpose for the Usability Design and
        Evaluation Plan and describes why the work product is produced.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Engagement Overview:</strong> This section describes the client company in a few paragraphs and describes
        the specific organization IBM has engaged.&nbsp; This section also typically describes the application and its
        intended benefit, particularly from an end user perspective.&nbsp; The reader may be referred to supporting
        information such as the client’s Web site and the applicable contract under which the work is being performed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>User-Centered Design Process:</strong> This section provides a brief description of user-centered design,
        its benefits, and a general overview of how the process is achieved.&nbsp; In addition, high-level usability goals
        and features are described.&nbsp; Usability goals are refined into usability requirements later in the design
        process.&nbsp; Usability features are refined into detailed usability design requirements later in the design
        process. Usability goals, design requirements, and later refined design requirements need to address the usability
        of the accessibility features of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Problem “Fix” Rate Model:</strong> This section identifies the problem fix rate model for the
        solution.&nbsp; Problem severity is characterized in a three-level severity rating, which is consistent with that
        used in the industry.&nbsp; There are three fix rate levels that are typically considered.&nbsp; The selection of a
        particular fix rate level is negotiated with the client and guides the sizing of the usability design and
        evaluation effort. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Model 1: “Market Leader’” Fix Rate:</strong> This is appropriate for projects that need to claim a
                market leadership position in ease-of-use&nbsp;&nbsp; This model targets fixing 100% of Level 1, 100% of
                Level 2, and 90% of Level 3 problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Model 2: “Meets Competition” Fix Rate:</strong> This is appropriate for projects that need to focus
                on meeting competitive, industry levels of ease-of-use&nbsp; This model targets fixing 100% of Level 1, 90%
                of Level 2, and 65% of Level 3 problems.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Model 3: “Maintain Status” Fix Rate:</strong> This is appropriate for projects where competitive,
                industry levels of ease-of-use are not judged to be important, but where a base level of ease-of-use is
                required.&nbsp; This model targets fixing 100% of Level 1, 80% of Level 2, and 50% of Level 3 problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                The levels of user problems are as follows: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Severity Level 1.</em> Users are unable to continue with a task or series of tasks due to the
                        problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Severity Level 2.</em> Users have considerable difficulty completing a task or series of tasks
                        but are eventually able to continue.&nbsp; Users may fail to complete a task correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Severity Level 3.</em> Users have minor difficulty completing a task or series of
                        tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sizing Estimates, Activities, Deliverables, and Schedule:</strong> This section provides a high-level
        summary of the sizing estimates for the usability design and evaluation effort, the activities/tasks that will
        occur, and their associated hours, timeframe, deliverables, additional hardware requirements (to meet accessibility
        and resource requirements), and delivery schedule.&nbsp; Any additional sizing estimates for accessibility support
        are included for the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Multidisciplinary Team:</strong> This section describes the members of the user-centered design
        multidisciplinary team that are responsible for the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation
        of all components of the user interface.&nbsp; This section also identifies whether the team member is a full- or
        part-time participant. A team member with accessibility skills should be considered.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Assumptions and Dependencies:</strong> This section describes assumptions required for any given
        deliverable or task, such as dependencies between user interface and application development tasks and other
        development tasks.&nbsp; To meet accessibility requirements, there will be additional dependencies to provide
        assistive technology and perhaps recruit users with disabilities as part of the evaluation process. When users with
        disabilities participate in the evaluation, ensure the facility and orientation materials accommodate their special
        needs (large print, sign language interpreter, wheelchair ramps, etc.) by asking them for their special needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Change Control Process:</strong> This section describes the process for making changes to the usability
        design and evaluation effort, including the: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assumptions

    The Usability Design and Evaluation Plan is typically 10 to 20 pages in length, depending on the size of the
    engagement.&nbsp; It should provide a high-level overview of all of the user-centered design activities, but the
    details of each effort should reside in each of the detailed work products.
</p>
<p>
    Often a design notebook is set up to track the user-centered design efforts.&nbsp; A design notebook is a repository
    for the Usability Design and Evaluation Plan, and for all artifacts of the design process, including user feedback data
    and reports, code, design objectives, design rationales, prototypes of the user interface, visual design, and the
    design specification, among others.&nbsp; The design notebook is a “living document” that changes and grows as the
    design progresses.&nbsp; A record of the design activities of the team aids intra-team communication.&nbsp; In the case
    of turnover of key team members, a new team member has the benefit of being able to review the evolution of the design.
</p>
<p>
    Usability Design and Evaluation Plan should&nbsp;not be expanded to verify accessibility - that's not the purpose of
    this work product.&nbsp; An Accessibility Design and Evaluation Plan should verify technical accessibility - for
    example that all images have alt text.&nbsp; The Usability plan&nbsp;should however verify that when a blind user
    listens to the product the alt text is meaningful and useful.&nbsp; It&nbsp;should verify that someone with a
    disability can use the product just as easily as someone without a disability.&nbsp; See References for information on
    doing usability testing with users who have disabilities.
</p>
<p>
    Additional advice includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Engage all key team members in creating the plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be very specific with regard to team member roles, deliverables, schedules, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure special needs accommodations (large print, sign language translation, etc.) are considered when engaging the
        sponsor, stakeholders, and&nbsp;team members.
    </li>
    <li>
        Secure necessary approvals for the Usability Design and Evaluation Plan prior to kicking off the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Secure training for team member and the team as a whole if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss and document extent of team empowerment versus the need for management approval of various checkpoints.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Projects that need to claim compliance with Accessibility Standards should target fixing 100% of all accessibility
    defects.&nbsp; Products deployed with known accessibility defects may meet the standards required by federal (U.S. EU,
    Australia, Japan, etc.), state and local government, education, and enterprises.
