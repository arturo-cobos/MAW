<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Main Description</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Data Stores are an extrapolation of the Information Classes defined in a high-level business information model, grouped
    to reflect data characteristics. The way in which data is grouped will guide many later design and implementation
    decisions, and is driven by business requirements (not technology), such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>"One customer database or ten?"</b> A business may require a single view of customer data, irrespective of
        organization, while another, for business and or legal reasons, may insist that customer data is owned at a
        divisional level, and no single view of customer data is allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>"How big is the data store, and how is it used?"</b> A data store which is large (and probably growing), which
        also needs to support a high rate of read/write activity will pose a very different design challenge to one which,
        although very large, is relatively stable and used only as reference (read only) data.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This Data Stores work product can be defined at different levels, dependent on the scope of an engagement and the time
    available for these activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Conceptual data stores level - where the focus is on defining the main data stores and their overall
        characteristics. This level is used as input to the definition of enterprise-wide rules, polices and guidelines on
        data access, sharing, placement and management
    </li>
    <li>
        Logical data stores level - where all required data stores and their detailed characteristics and operational
        considerations are defined. This level is used as a direct input to system design activities, driving the shape and
        style of specific solutions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A data store represents a logical grouping of data. It does not imply any decisions regarding data replication,
    segmentation, copy management, or any specific database technology. Rather, it captures the requirements that will
    drive decisions on replication, segmentation and copy management, using defined enterprise-wide data access and
    placement guidelines. Further on, in the development of an enterprise architecture model and during system design,
    these requirements will be used to provide guidance on the selection of standards and components to support the
    physical implementation of data stores (databases) to meet business usage, availability and management objectives. In
    addition, data stores identified at an enterprise level may decompose into many, more detailed data stores when
    designing a specific single business system.
</p></td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Notation</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    The notation is largely tabular, often with supporting descriptive text. Such text will explain the nature of the
    characteristic (table columns) as well as the nature of the logical data store (table rows).
</p>
<p>
    It is useful to link the data stores defined here to the data entities (or data subject areas, or information classes)
    in the enterprise information model. This can be shown in a matrix form (and is sometimes referred to as a data
    store/entity cross-reference).
</p>
<p>
    Each data store represents a subset of business data with different characteristics (i.e., types, based on volume,
    volatility, form), different usage, access and management requirements. The characteristics used will generally be
    chosen based on the identified needs of the enterprise or the target business system.
</p>
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Size: How big is the data group - large volumes of static data, vs. transactional data?
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Rates of Growth: 10% per annum, vs. 400% (by acquisition) over the next 2 years
    </li>
    <li>
        Volatility: What is the rate of change of the data in the data group - 50% of the data changes daily, vs. 2% of the
        data changes monthly?
    </li>
    <li>
        Currency: How up to date does the data have to be - maximum of one minute vs. value as at close of monthly trading?
    </li>
    <li>
        Form: Is it text, image, structured, etc.?
    </li>
    <li>
        Access: Is the data mostly accessed "read only," or does it require update?
    </li>
    <li>
        Service Characteristics: Performance, availability, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Partitioning Requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Sharing Requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Management Requirements
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Deciding which characteristics are important, and what values they take, normally depends on the context of the data's
    usage. For example, currency requirements may be dependent on who the users of the data are, and what they require of
    the data; or the volatility of a data store may depend on the time of day or year.

<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">Ensure the information captured in this work product is validated by business representatives. Much of the information is
"non functional," e.g., volumes, volatility, etc, and it is likely that much will have been estimated or assumed. 
<p>
    Remember, with this work product, the objective is to identify what the data stores are (might be), not how they are to
    be implemented, how they are to be managed within a particular database technology, or how they are to be distributed
    across the enterprise.
</p>
<p>
    Do not, therefore, allow yourself to take too much account of technical or implementation considerations. This work
    product is very much focused on requirements, and finding a way of describing the business data of the enterprise, or
    business system, in a manner which allows it to be carved up into manageable and distinctly different chunks which will
    make the business of systems implementation more straight forward.<br />
</p>
<p>
    In order to ensure a robust work product, it is important to make use of experience in the deployment and management of
    business data within the enterprise, as well as people who understand the business requirements - although the focus is
    on requirements, there is a great benefit in ensuring the "art of the possible" is equally understood.
