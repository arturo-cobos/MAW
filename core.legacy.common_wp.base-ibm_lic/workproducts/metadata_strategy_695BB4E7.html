    This artifact results from a need to determine how best to plan and approach the business and technical challenges
    associated with metadata.&nbsp; This artifact is used to document a statement of direction and intent regarding
    metadata -particularly as it pertains to an envisioned or planned system solution.&nbsp; This artifact explains the
    extent to which metadata management capabilities are contemplated and depicts the specific objectives to be attained
    regarding metadata, and the strategic moves needed to realize the desired future position.&nbsp; A Metadata Strategy is
    used to describe the underlying business and technical context which a metadata management facility (metadata
    repository, data warehouse catalogue, business information directory, model management tool-set) would be defined and
    implemented in.
</p><p/><p>
    The main purpose of a Metadata Strategy is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Document the customer’s perspective or point of view regarding metadata, its purpose, use and administration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the significance of the client’s metadata strategy and its relationship to the client’s business
        objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the overall plan and approach regarding metadata that the customer intends to undertake.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the degree to which metadata capabilities are envisioned as being part of the envisioned overall solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the critical success factors - those essential circumstances or conditions that have a major influence on
        whether the customer’s metadata objectives are achieved.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the current roles and organizations within the customer’s company that are pertinent to the capture,
        storage, dissemination or management of metadata.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the stage for the formal identification of functional and technical requirements for a metadata management
        facility.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop data resource management, project-support recommendations - for purposes of sustaining future activities or
        projects to be performed by IBM.

    Data definition is to data what a blueprint is to a constructed building. Metadata management is a key factor in
    administering control over data assets and in maintaining data quality. The management and governance of data resources
    requires a thorough knowledge of what data assets exist and how and where they are used.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Data documentation is not necessarily a data definition. A data definition is a statement that provides a clear
            and distinct meaning and description of data used by the business or of importance to a business solution.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Metadata management provides those capabilities which are used to fully explain the meaning and context of the
            data used to run and assess the effectiveness, efficiency and direction of the business enterprise.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Business intelligence (BI) solutions are data driven or data centric and rely on metadata management
            facilities. This reliance is a key element that distinguishes business intelligence solutions from other types
            of computer-based information systems. A metadata facility is used to exploit the full potential of a BI
            solution by providing business users and technical users with information (metadata) about the contents of the
            data warehouse, data mart or other specialized data store organized to enable direct access and retrieval.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            They play an important role in facilitating organizations’ overall approach to knowledge management –
            particularly in creating or discovering knowledge, and providing a common platform for knowledge sharing among
            all knowledge workers within an organization.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The very existence of a business intelligence (BI) system of some sort suggests that a metadata management
            facility also exists in order to provide information to the BI system user about the systems data contents, its
            data sources, access procedures, and the proper use of data. Given, metadata’s importance, a documented
            description of the overall strategy in support of metadata is essential.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        From a business intelligence perspective, metadata collection, storage, and dissemination is an on-going activity
        that lasts as long as the BI solution itself. A metadata facility is used prominently to facilitate the various
        collection, storage and dissemination processes.
    </li>
</ul><p/><p>

    Metadata is the glue that connects the components of most systems - high-volume transactional systems, ERP systems,
    web-enabled systems, business intelligence solutions etc. Should this work product not be prepared, the project team
    will need to formulate some key assumptions regarding metaddata and its use, and then proceed with defining, designing
    and developing the system using those assumptions. This approach heightens the risk of failing to meet the needs of the
    business and technical (systems) communities. Moreover, the assumptions made about metadata management and use may not
    coincide with the&nbsp;organization's strategy.
</p>
<p>
    Also, the lack of a metadata strategy can help perpetuate data quality concerns and data standardization needs of the
    organization. The risk of having unknown or undocumented business and technical definitions is heightened. The
    opportunity to efficiently collect and document data element meanings at the point of solution definition and design
    could be lost. Should a Metadata Strategy not be used, then the project team will most likely have no focused and
    explicit statement of direction regarding data standards quality, data definition quality, and data architecture (data
    model design) quality. This may lead to considerable rework later in the lifecycle, and possibly higher costs to
    capture and reconstruct the metadata after the solution has been developed and put in use. Experience suggests that the
    activities to resolve data quality and data standardization issues of an eventual application system solution are a
    significant portion of the total work effort.
</p><p/><p>
    Given the absence of a Metadata Strategy (or some other equivalent) there will most likely be ambiguity surrounding the
    client’s intended direction for metadata management and usage. The absence of a Metadata Strategy will most likely
    result in the <i>lack of a clear statement</i> which:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Defines the scope of envisioned metadata capabilities to be included in the solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Focuses on and provides an assessment of the current metadata management organization framework.
    </li>
    <li>
        Articulates the clients desired (future) metadata position and the strategic actions necessary to attain that
        position.
    </li>
    <li>
        Specifically describes IBM’s understanding of the client’s vision and direction regarding metadata. There would be
        no artifact that documents the client’s intentions and direction to either pursue the implementation of a metadata
        facility, not pursue its implementation, or to utilize and leverage an existing and available facility.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies metadata constraints and issues.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This vagueness could result in miscommunication between the client and the project team about metadata, and lead to
    design omissions, inadequate functionality, reduced system benefit, or a system that is difficult to use or to
    maintain.

</p>
<p>
    A Metadata Strategy may not be needed in circumstances where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The client has formulated a metadata strategy and can provide this in documented form
    </li>
    <li>
        The client has metadata management systems already in place and/or has already defined and documented the role and
        use of those capabilities in support of planned Business Intelligence initiatives or projects
    </li>
    <li>
        The client has already positioned metadata and metadata management within a solution framework and had made
        decisions on the applicability and relative importance of metadata management as part of the envisioned solution.
        The client has defined a direction regarding metadata usage and administration for the intended system solution
    </li>
    <li>
        The client has specifically indicated that the scope of the work to be performed by IBM should not take into
        account metadata management
