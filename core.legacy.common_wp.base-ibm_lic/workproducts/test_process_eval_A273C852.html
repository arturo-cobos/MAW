    improvements required by providing a structured report of the test assessment findings to reinforce these
    recommendations.&nbsp; It shows the current status of quality and test components that have been reviewed, the gaps
    between what exists and what is required to successfully manage and execute testing and define and/or meet quality
    standards, and identifies areas for remediation to address these gaps.

    The report consolidates the findings of assessment interviews and/or workshops conducted and reviews of documentation
    collected. It presents the conclusions and recommendations to manage the testing risks in going forward for the
    organization, project or test level, depending on the scope of the project.
</p>
<p>
    An assessment may be conducted at the beginning of a testing, or as a&nbsp;separate project to establish what test
    components are in place in an organization:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        quality standards, quality plans and quality assurance organizations
    </li>
    <li>
        risk management processes, strategies and plans
    </li>
    <li>
        test processes, strategies and plans,
    </li>
    <li>
        test tools and environments

    The evaluation report is a combination of data collection and documentation templates It may include formal
    presentation charts for recommendations.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Executive Summary Presentation -</strong> This set of presentation charts provides an executive summary of
        the assessment objectives, approach, results and recommendations.&nbsp; It is supported by detailed information
        from other sections, presented as appendices, handouts or compiled into a written report.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        presentation charts may also appear as a summary at the beginning of such a report.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interview Guide or Workshop Agenda</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Interview Guide -</em> The Interview Guide documents the topics and questions designed to drive out the
                desired information in a logical and succinct fashion.&nbsp; It may or may not be provided to the
                interviewee prior to the interview.&nbsp; It facilitates keeping the interview on track; coverage of all
                topics and minimizing the need to revisit any interviewees with unanswered questions.&nbsp; While the list
                is intended as a guide, there is also space for capturing important quotes and unanticipated responses
                focusing on new aspects that should be incorporated for other interviews.&nbsp; The common list of
                questions helps the interviewer identify disparate views and conflicting information more easily.&nbsp; It
                also allows the interviewer to timebox the interview.&nbsp; The guide provides a template to capture and
                consolidate data from the interviews.&nbsp; It may appear as an appendix to the final report.&nbsp; The
                interview guide is usually in table form.&nbsp; It may or may not be included in the final report.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Workshop Agenda -</em> In a small project, with a short timeframe or with only a few stakeholders to
                survey, a workshop could take the place of interviews.&nbsp; A workshop agenda and presentation could be
                included as an appendix to the report.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Interviewees or Workshop Participants -</em> A list of interviewees or workshop participants would be
                included (with their roles, contact names and the areas of contribution to this assessment).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Documents Reviewed</strong> - A list of documents reviewed is usually attached to the report.&nbsp; Some
        candidates would be: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Quality policies and plans
            </li>
            <li>
                Quality and test organization procedures
            </li>
            <li>
                Other assessment reports
            </li>
            <li>
                Quality and test plans
            </li>
            <li>
                Project definition, plans and early deliverables
            </li>
            <li>
                Project risk management strategy and plans
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Findings</strong> - This section consolidates the findings of the interviews and document reviews for
        analysis. It may appear as an appendix to the final report.&nbsp; The format may be the interview guide in table
        format with consolidated and/or compiled details or summaries thereof opposite each question.&nbsp; It may also be
        in text form if there is to be a text report.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Analysis</strong> - This is where the logical flow from findings to recommendations is documented. It
        assists in identifying areas with general consensus and those where there is no congruence.&nbsp; It provides some
        capability for measuring priority of risks and shortfalls in the environment by collecting data on impact and
        probability.&nbsp; It is organized to support the next section, Recommendations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Recommendations -</strong> This is a set of recommended actions supported by estimates of costs, benefits,
        timing and/or assignees for the actions to be taken.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each recommendation is supported by findings from
        the assessment interviews and/or workshop output.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Glossary and Definitions</strong> - list of terms and definitions used in the report.<br />

        Interview guides and templates only provide guidance.&nbsp; Focus on key areas of challenge or difficulty for this
        organization.&nbsp; Remember to look for strengths as well areas for improvement.&nbsp; Watch for hints of
        additional issues other than those anticipated and follow up in the discussion.&nbsp; If necessary, adjust the
        interview guide or agenda to reflect the new information and test out the conclusions on previous and future
        interviewees and/or workshop participants.
    </li>
    <li>
        Try to avoid analysis paralysis.&nbsp; As soon as you have some reasonable results, try them out on key individuals
        to identify issues or gaps in your information early.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus on high-risk items.&nbsp; Look for a combination of quick fixes and longer-term improvements to
        implement.&nbsp; Balance these by the audience.&nbsp; If this is a small project with limited resources, lean
        towards the quick fixes.&nbsp; If this is a larger project with more resources, consider some big ticket items that
        could significantly boost the chances of success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide some skeletal planning information for recommendations: high-level action plan, estimates and cost/benefit
        data.
    </li>
    <li>
        The&nbsp;report should flow logically from findings and conclusions to recommendations.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The presentation, if provided, should summarize findings in a few charts with appendices of supporting detail.
    </li>
    <li>
        Analysis of findings and conclusions should facilitate prioritization of risks.&nbsp; The recommendations for
        improvement should address the risk mitigation strategy as well as process areas in need of repair. This report, in
        draft form, should be a communications tool to develop consensus before its final presentation.&nbsp; By discussing
        results with interviewees, stakeholders and sponsor prior to presentation, you should have a comfortable feeling of
        its acceptability to the audience.
