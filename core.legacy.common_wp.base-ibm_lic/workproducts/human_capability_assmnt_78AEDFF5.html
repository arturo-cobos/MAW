    Note the contrast of the traditional training model with the more modern view of a performance model. IBM consultants
    should ensure that, even though this work product is designed to help identify training requirements, the overall
    context is performance. This permits the identification of other performance enablers that may be required as well. The
    language used in the deliverable should reflect this broader view of capability.&nbsp;

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    <b>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT</b> to ensure that skills data is used appropriately. Using it for selection or promotion of
    employees raises significant legal issues. If the data is to be used as a primary, direct source for selection or
    promotion, a great degree of rigor must be used. The process and data must be legally defensible and the consultants
    should be comfortable testifying in court. In these cases, it is critical to use consultants with the requisite
    academic and experiential qualifications.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, it is important that this assessment be kept firmly in the context of the initiative it supports, and not
    become connected with the client’s performance appraisal process.
</p>
<p>
    In workshops, spend enough time explaining categories and levels of capabilities, as well as differentiating among
    skills, knowledge, and behaviors, and ensure that the client understands before proceeding. Have examples and
    “non-examples” ready.
</p>
<p>
    Pay special attention to capabilities residing in a single individual -- they may require replication in the new
    environment.
</p>
<p>
    IBM consultants should also make clear that behind a competency model there are many theories that confirm its value
    and that make it for, for example, “the balance of competencies.” The balance of competence is a method and a means
    used to manage skills and attitudes by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Monitoring the professional development level of each employee on different subjects
    </li>
    <li>
        Respecting both the firm’s industrial objectives and the employee’s desired professional growth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using different types of evaluation tests (interviews, open and closed tests).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In fact, this method is based on the <b>constructivist</b> ideology that considers people as the protagonists of their
    life, because they can construct step-by-step, choice after choice, their way of being and their way of living. In
    fact, what is important to underline is that the balance of competencies is not a method based only on the firm
    requirements, (for example, “Every one in my firm must be able to use PowerPoint”), but also on the professional
    (slope) orientation and desires of the employee. Then by using different type of tests (open/close) the balance of
    competence becomes a means to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Evaluate the capabilities of the employees,
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Register their wishes and the firm’s objectives.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Establish each employee’s professional growth path.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    By using this method, a firm can assure the best possible scenarios in “taking care” of its intellectual capital.

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Impact of not having</th><td class="sectionTableCell">A poor understanding of current employee skills can jeopardize the efficient and thorough development of a reskilling and
training strategy. Inadequate training can result, which can leave gaps in skills that might impede the successful

false assumption that training will solve all the problems (In a recent client engagement, only 15% of performance issues
could be addressed by training.)</td>

    If the current organization assessment shows evidence of a strategic, responsive, flexible competency management
    process that is regularly used to predict future skill needs and fill current and future gaps, then the client is
    likely to have outputs that are the equivalent of this work product. The client should employ its process to make sure
    it has identified all new knowledge, skills, and behaviors required by the initiative, and has identified the root
    causes of performance issues.
</p>
<p>
    The following are NOT examples of a good competency management process, and if they are encountered, the work product
    should be used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The client has recently completed an assessment of employee capability, for example, as a part of a regular
        appraisal process. This information may be used to add value to the work product but it cannot substitute for it.
        Such a process is unlikely to have considered new skill and accessibility requirements or probed for impediments to
        performance that are not related to training.
    </li>
    <li>
        A basic skills development model (e.g., Investors In People, a registration system to demonstrate that human
        resource processes are in place) is not sufficient, as it is unlikely to be responsive enough to adapt to a changed
        environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        A skills model and inventory that does not include desired behaviors. This is a very important and often overlooked
        element.
