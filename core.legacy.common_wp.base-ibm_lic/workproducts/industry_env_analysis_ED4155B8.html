    <strong>Value Net</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A value net illustrates the key Players in a firm’s value system namely: customers, suppliers, complementors and
    competitors/substitutors.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Competitor/Substitutor: A player is your Competitor/substitutor if customers value your product/service less when
        they have the other player's product/service than when they have your product/service alone.&nbsp; In addition, a
        player is your substitutor if it is less attractive for a supplier to provide resources to you when it is also
        supplying the other player than when it is supplying you alone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Complementor: A player is your complementor if customers value your product/service more when they also have the
        other player's product/service than when they have your product/service alone.&nbsp; In addition, a player is your
        complementor if it is more attractive for the supplier to provide resources to you when it is also supplying the
        other player than when it is supplying you alone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Customers and suppliers play symmetric roles, while competitors and complementors play mirror-image roles.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Value Net looks to understand not only the activities along a company’s value chain but also to look at how
    competitor and complementor relationships can impact strategic decision-making in terms of competition threats and
    cooperation opportunities.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Successful business strategy is about actively shaping the game you play, not just playing the game you find. Value
        Net analysis helps organizations to analyze how to influence the PARTS (Players, Added Value, Rules, Tactics and
        Scope) to their advantage in order to create and capture value.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Value Net analysis can also be leveraged to hypothesize a company’s strategy. By analyzing the environment and the
    industry, and linking this information to the company’s behavior around the value net, we can derive some insightful
    hypotheses as to the company’s strategy.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="334" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.base-ibm_lic/workproducts/resources/inenvnot1.JPG" width="534" />
</p>
<p>
    The players in the business environment can be grouped at three analytical levels - Arena, Industry & Firm.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>External Value System</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    We use the Value System model to map the business environment, and understand the players and their interactions. Using
    business context analysis we identify the interactions with a business entity, including the data flows which serve as
    the basis for business events and business process identification.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="377" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.base-ibm_lic/workproducts/resources/inenvnot2.JPG" width="582" />
</p>
<p>
    By analyzing the value system we may identify potential threats and opportunities that exist outside the boundaries of
    focus of the&nbsp; business entity or that exist in the arena surrounding the industry.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Value chain</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Value chains outline the chain of incremental steps in which value is created. Value chain analysis can be used for
    example to assess; current positioning and participation, supply/demand chain relationships, chain improvement
    opportunities, vertical/horizontal integration opportunities, (dis-)intermediation threats and opportunities, and value
    capture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <img height="496" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.base-ibm_lic/workproducts/resources/inenvnot3.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Competitive Forces model</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The competitive forces analysis looks at current state of Porter’s five forces as well as how these forces have changed
    over time. The forces include:
</p>
<p>
    <img height="452" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.base-ibm_lic/workproducts/resources/inenvnot4.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bargaining Power of Buyers: the extent to which customers capture total product/service value by forcing the firm
        to lower the price of a product/service.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bargaining power of suppliers: the degree to which suppliers capture total product/service value by raising the
        price of input to firms.
    </li>
    <li>
        Threat of potential substitutes: Degree to which price/performance of alternative products/services lowers the
        maximum price of a firm’s product/service.
    </li>
    <li>
        Threat of new entrants: Degree to which the ability of firms to enter the market lowers the maximum price of a
        product/service.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rivalry among existing competitors: Extent to which industry participants compete or cooperate.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>External influences and trends</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The competitive forces analysis can be augmented by examining some key macro-level trends and influences: Social,
    Technological, Economic, Environmental, and Political (STEEP) factors.&nbsp; It may include specific analysis of other
    key influences: legal, globalization, deregulation and digitization.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Scenarios</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Scenarios analysis can be very effective tool to illustrate possible industry, business or value distribution structure
    in the future. The scenarios can be based on interpretations of for example on; how competitive forces, influences and
    trends may change the current environment of players, interactions and value distribution.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="356" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.base-ibm_lic/workproducts/resources/inenvnot5.JPG" width="579" />
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    <strong>Competitive Response: ‘Play the Game’ or ‘Change the Rules’</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Understanding of the industry environment provides means to analyze opportunities and threats resulting from possible
    competitive responses. Some examples of potential responses to a firm’s current environment:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Insulating the company in light of the existing industry structure: This response builds defenses against
        competitive forces or finds positions in the industry where forces are weakest. Knowledge of the company’s
        capabilities and of the forces will instruct the company on where to confront competition and where to avoid
        it.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Influencing industry structure: This can be done by affecting elements of the five forces or locking in certain
        elements of the business environment (e.g. vertical integration with suppliers).
    </li>
    <li>
        Revolutionizing industry structure: This can be done by redrawing industry boundaries, redefining market space and
        re-conceiving products and services.<br />

        The Client should have active involvement so they can develop understanding of the strategic positions that will be
        driven from this analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is particularly important to gain confidence of management at this early stage in a strategy engagement, and to
        seek their views on how best to proceed, offering some alternatives.&nbsp; The final strategy will be theirs to
        implement, and, as such, their involvement and commitment to the process and the outcome is essential.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Senior Management should review all opportunities and threats and decide which ones they want to investigate
        further within the scope of the strategy engagement.&nbsp; Also they should review any issues raised and decide how
        they want to address them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Special care must be given to individuals who may feel threatened in any way by the engagement, particularly
        business unit managers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Credibility of the analysis:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For analysis credibility purposes, rely on senior industry, functional and technical specialists for competitive
        and market sector information. The use of Client’s internal domain specialists at this stage will help build the
        support and commitment to the strategy within the client organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure segmentation and other data is current and not obsolete. It is vital that when market data is analyzed and
        used for Industry Environment Analysis, that it is current and reflects the current business environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Strategic analysis of industry sector and competitive factors is essential for drawing pertinent business based
        conclusions from internally and externally sourced information and experience.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>General advice:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ask for documented strategy information. Look for vision statement, mission statement, future business goals, list
        of key business drivers, management system (organization, opportunity identification, decision making, funding),
        key target market segments, list of target wants and needs, key value propositions, list of strategic market
        positions, critical success factors, distinctive competencies, critical capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask the client for their business intelligence information on market research, segmentation, and company
        data.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Be prepared to deal with complex organization structures.&nbsp; For example, if a global company, it may be
        necessary to understand corporate objectives and identify similarities and differences across subsidiaries.&nbsp;
        This may require some or all subsidiaries to be assessed individually.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only produce the briefest documents as summaries of the key findings.
    </li>
</ul>

    Failure to understand the business environment will have a negative impact on next business strategy methodology steps

</p><p/>Understanding a client’s business environment and value chain is an essential input for e-business and many types of IT
consulting engagements to understand the environment and nature of potential linkages with players in the environment.
Without the Industry Environment, the client may not be able to identify potential repercussions or potential negative
responses of players within the value system. In addition, a client may fail to understand how they fit into the value
chain and the threats and opportunities surrounding their current positioning.</td>
