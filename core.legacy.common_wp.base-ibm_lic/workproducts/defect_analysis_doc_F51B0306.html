    The purpose of the Defect Analysis Document is to provide a permanent record of the analysis of a defect, the outcome
    of the analysis and the recommended action to correct the defect and all impacted associated system and test
    components. It is used to expand information on the defects, which are identified in the project lifecycle and logged,
    in summary form, on the Defect Log. The Defect Analysis Document ensures that any defects raised during a testing
    project are formally documented in a correct and consistent format and given a unique identifier. It provides an audit
    trail for evaluating analysis and resolution of a defect and supports metrics related to the quality and defect
    management objectives for the organization and the testing project. It also serves:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        to provide direction/instruction/aid to the application development, testing or user management team on how to
        correct the defect generated during the project
    </li>
    <li>
        to track the effort consumed in resolving a defect (and support collection of defect management metrics and
        estimating guidelines by complexity, work product type, phase of project, and skills)
    </li>
    <li>
        to facilitate the decision on whether it is worthwhile, in terms of return on investment (ROI) and/or quality
        objectives to deploy resources to address the defect
    </li>
    <li>
        to support the decision against resolving the defect (close without action within acceptable quality parameters) or
        the decision to postpone the resolution to a later date
    </li>
    <li>
        to facilitate tracking of the source of the defects by complexity, work product type, phase of project, technology
        and skills in order to identify, both during and after the project, where defects originate and the possible root
        causes
    </li>
    <li>
        to support audit trails for project or organizational quality reviews if problems occur with the application once
        implemented in Production; and
    </li>
    <li>
        to facilitate a root cause analysis program or ODC (see References Section) which may be performed to improve the
        quality of the application during preventive or perfective maintenance.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Complete all sections of the Defect Analysis Document as thoroughly as possible.&nbsp; The description of the defect
    may appear simple and obvious to the author but confusing and complex to the recipient who will be doing the analysis,
    and similarly the analysis and estimate may appear simple, but be misinterpreted by the resolution team.&nbsp; Avoid
    ambiguous terminology, abbreviations and messy diagrams.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Be cautious when capturing information on the defect.&nbsp; Focus first on describing the defect, not what the possible
    causes may be; this will be the purpose of the analysis step.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is considerate to attach supporting
    documentation in an organized manner, explaining its purpose, e.g. this core dump was taken when program XXX3363,
    module aaa-bb-cd abended on an OC4 whilst running Unit Test #4 using the Customer and Product databases at 14:15:23 on
    23/09/2000.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The Test Manager should facilitate the efficient flow of defect analysis documents and activity.&nbsp; Any originator
    of Defect Analysis Documents should complete them as the defects are discovered and then batch them for each test
    execution cycle and submit them to the Test Manager for prioritization.&nbsp; For iterations around the same test, do
    not hand over one document at a time for analysis as one defect may trigger another and it is then more advantageous to
    analyze the thread of a series of defects to derive a resolution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    In order to ensure that adequate resources are scheduled to resolve defects according to priority, it is beneficial to
    have regular defect review meetings daily or weekly.&nbsp; At this meeting, development management, test management,
    and business and technical test specialists would
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        review all new defects, and assign them or reclassify them as issues, enhancements, etc
    </li>
    <li>
        review all closed defects and their resolutions
    </li>
    <li>
        discuss how defects should be batched or prioritized;&nbsp; and
    </li>
    <li>
        review the metrics such as number of open/fixed/closed defects, and trends in debug/fix time and project impact.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Any critical impact on project deadlines or budget, other dependent projects and high-risk items are escalated to the
    appropriate stakeholders such as the project sponsor for resolution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the project, the Defect Analysis Documents should be collated into logical batches (e.g. by
    project/sub-project/test levels/test cycles/test types/defect severity/application impacted) and handed over (with the
    Defect Log)&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the test organization for trends analysis on defect management effectiveness;&nbsp; and&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        the application maintenance team (a) for reference in case the same error arises in production or during testing of
        enhancements and (b) for root cause analysis in preventive or perfective maintenance.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In a mature test organization, where an automated defect management toolset is used, there may be some overlaps in
    information captured on the Defect Log and the Defect Analysis Document and the tool will dictate where the data is
    captured.

    The omission of a Defect Analysis Document could impact the integrity and quality of the applications and the data it
    outputs, depending on the severity of the defect. This is true whether the defect is with the deliverable produced from
    test management, static or dynamic testing activities or whatever the phase and size of the testing project. The impact
    of not having defects documented in detail, analyzed and addressed could be very costly if they are neglected or
    forgotten due to project pressures, etc. A few sample defects which if lost, could cause the project to fail or
    increase the risk of failure are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        During Test Management: error in the scoping of the test project could cause an overrun of schedule and budget,
        necessitate submission of change requests too late in the testing lifecycle, and shortage of resources to achieve
        the quality and test objectives. This would impact the finances and deadlines for the project adversely, resulting
        in a cascading of negative effects throughout the entire value chain of the organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        During Static Testing: error in documenting a functional requirement (e.g. capability of software (systems and
        application) to process 10000 vs. 100000 transactions per hour, or user response time required is 1
        second/transaction vs. 10 seconds/transaction) would result in analysis, design, build and testing effort being
        wasted on meeting a misdocumented requirement. If found during stress and acceptance testing (or not found until
        the application is implemented live), this would result in substantial costly rework and user dissatisfaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        During Dynamic Testing: a code error in one program module that produces incorrect output is not thoroughly
        analyzed for the impact on other applications resulting in wrong data being processed and transmitted throughout
        the organization (e.g. in calculating the interest on a savings account<i>: savings-account-interest =
        savings-account-amount / interest rate / 100</i> vs. <i>savings-account-interest = savings-account-amount /
        interest rate x 100</i>). If this defect is bypassed in the Defect Log and not analyzed and documented in the
        Defect Analysis Document for correction by the project, it could cost the organization loss of finances and
        credibility with customers.
    </li>

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell">The Defect Analysis Document is required for capturing the details of a defect, its analysis and resolution for all testing
activities throughout the project lifecycle. If it is a minor defect or the details of the defect and its resolution are
negligible, then the information in the Defect Log may be sufficient and this Work Product may be omitted. If during
analysis, it is found that what is recorded is not in actual fact a defect (e.g. it may be an incident, issue or problem
which should be addressed in a different process), then the Defect Analysis Document should be used to record that the
“defect” has been transferred to another process, and the unique identifier for that process be documented. This will
enable test management to trace the series of activities and outcomes relating to this particular incident, issue or
problem, even if it has been deferred to a later date for the purposes of, for example, root cause analysis or to be
corrected in the next release of the application.</td>
