    Transactions are important to provide robustness and consistency in distributed systems and enable users at different
    locations to work together in a coordinated fashion. In the event of a failure, any ongoing transactions are aborted,
    and uncommitted modified objects are restored to a consistent state. In a distributed object environment, transaction
    management may not be left to the database or to a conventional TP monitor, allowing for much finer-grained resource
    control mechanisms than otherwise can be obtained.
</p>
<p>
    Be aware that transactions in the object world might be different. Operations in an object-oriented system are run
    against objects in main memory. Transactions, too, are dealing not primarily with a database, but with objects in main
    memory. Keep in mind that data is not everything–processes are as important. In object-oriented systems, a transaction
    service running against objects in main memory is preferable to an underlying database transaction mechanism. At the
    end of a transaction–no matter if it is committed or aborted–the object stays in main memory.<br />
    <br />
    As one might expect, the unit of locking in an object-oriented system is the object – which would conform approximately
    to a row in a table. (Note that this is taken here as an analogy. Not all relational DBMS support row-level locking,
    and objects are always mapped onto a single row.)<br />
    <br />
    Follow standards as appropriate. As much as possible, make your transaction service compliant to a standard transaction
    service, especially the CORBA Transaction Service. This offers flexibility for its implementation.<br />
    <br />
    The following areas might require special attention:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Nested transactions:</b> Nested transactions allow the application developer to start an “internal” transaction
        while being already involved in an “external” transaction. In this way the granularity of a process can be
        increased, since it is possible to roll back single finer-grained “internal” transactions within a larger-grained
        “external” transaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Long running transactions:</b> Long running transactions are transactions that span several user sessions. That
        means a transaction is started in one session and terminated in another. It may even happen that during a long
        running transaction, an object that is checked out may be deleted by another transaction. Long running transactions
        are necessary, e.g., for mobile clients who download some objects from the server, change them while disconnected,
        and upload them again to the server.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Two-Phase Commit protocol in distributed environments:</b> Operations in a distributed environment (assuming
        there are multiple resource managers) can take place in different processes running on different computers and with
        different resources (databases, file systems). This makes the successful completion of a transaction dependent on
        the successful completion of each single operation in the distributed system. The mechanism used in cases like this
        is the Two-Phase Commit protocol. As its name suggests, a transaction’s commit has two phases: In Phase 1, all
        participating resources are “prepared.” Each resource must vote whether the transaction should be committed or
        rolled back. If all resources are able to commit, in Phase 2 the “commit” command is sent to all of them. If one or
        more resources are not able to commit, the transaction service sends a “rollback” to all participating resources.
        By using a Two-Phase Commit scheme, a transaction service can ensure that data impacted during a transaction in a
        distributed environment remains in a consistent state.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Integration with legacy systems and other parts of the application:</b> Whenever, a transaction in a newly
        developed system requires mapping onto one or more legacy transactions, multiple problems can arise: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 2-phase commit protocol may not be supported by all legacy systems
            </li>
            <li>
                The mapping between new and existing transactions needs to be resolved.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        The first problem can sometimes be remedied by persisting the actual modifications that have to be executed (so
        they can be retried if appropriate) or by executing compensating transactions in the case of failures.
    </p>
