    The conceptual model is created by interface designers and surfaced to users via a system’s interface. It communicates
    the organization of the system, its behavior, the tasks it supports, and the relationships among its objects. It
    employs metaphors to achieve mapping of the user’s mental model to a conceptual model.
</p>
<p>
    A <strong>mental model</strong> is an internal cognitive structure that people use to understand and predict how the
    world is structured and how it works; in other it is the users' conceptions of how the world is structured.&nbsp;
    Mental models help people understand and predict the behavior of new events by fitting them into existing
    concepts.&nbsp; For example, there may be several mental models for how to write a letter. One such model may be that
    of a typewriter. Another might be a “Dictaphone” model. While a mental model is individual, a conceptual model is
    shared.&nbsp; A model helps people complete tasks without having to reconstruct the “how” each time the task arises.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>User interface objects</strong> are used in the user interface to represent “real world” objects (e.g., files,
    folders, and phones). The relationships among the objects specify how user tasks are supported. Users implicitly group
    these objects together into like groups “in their minds.” These object groupings reflect the way users see the overall
    application – the way it is organized with regard to which objects/actions “go together” and the relative importance of
    these groupings. This information helps the designer represent the objects in the interface (e.g., which objects should
    reside in the same menu or behind the same buttons, which should be “up front” in the interface, which should be
    hidden, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Metaphors</strong> used to represent the objects, object relationships, and object/action groupings help
    communicate the model in ways that are familiar to the user.&nbsp; An example of a user interface metaphor is the use
    of the trashcan to represent a delete function. The user interface conceptual model needs to consider the alternative
    interface models used by people with disabilities. For example, blind users need an audio indication of the visual
    trashcan icon while deaf users need the visual alternative to the audio indication, such as an animated icon.
</p>
<p>
    Understanding the mental models of the intended users of a system is a crucial step in conceptual model design. By
    understanding mental models, it becomes possible to design a conceptual model and choose appropriate metaphors that map
    to existing mental models. The intended effect of this mapping is to ease the transition to a new system. Utilizing
    familiar metaphors generally reduces learning and increases retention curves as users will already “know” how to use a
    new system. In the letter writing example, a designer may choose to represent a word processing application as a
    typewriter, with an onscreen form that resembles a sheet of paper. Alternately, the designer may use the “Dictaphone”
    model and depict an onscreen “virtual secretary” who takes dictation. In both cases, metaphors (sheet of paper,
    secretary) are used to help the user understand how to use the system by depicting the new application’s objects as
    existing real-world objects with which the user is familiar.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to select visual and interaction paradigms that support the chosen model and metaphors. Certain visual
    treatments may help enhance the metaphors, whereas others may detract from them. For example, a photorealistic
    treatment may better support the “virtual secretary” metaphor than, for example, a cartoonish treatment, especially if
    the intended users are serious business people. With regard to interaction paradigms, in the “typewriter” model, the
    keyboard might be selected as the primary mode of input, whereas in the “Dictaphone” model, a microphone may be used.
    It is also important that this visual treatment be aesthetically pleasing to its intended users.
