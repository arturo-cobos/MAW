    Introduction
</h4>
<p>
    The ABC Kiosk Project Usability Design and Evaluation Plan is a document that specifies the activities, deliverables,
    schedules, dependencies, process, team members, and other aspects of how user-centered design will be implemented
    throughout the course of the design and development of the solution. Usability of the Accessibility design is included
    as part of the plan since the customer wants to be able to sell the Kiosk design to the US federal government which
    requires compliance with Section 508 accessibility standards. Its purpose is to ensure that ABC and its affiliates will
    provide their customers and end users (citizens) with a system that meets their needs from the standpoint of usability,
    accessibility, performance, and satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
    The Usability Design and Evaluation Plan is identified as an early deliverable in of the ABC Kiosk Project. The intent
    of this document is to create and maintain a high level of focus on the overall usability of the kiosk for all users,
    including those with disabilities. For the solution to succeed, it is important to establish and intensify the level of
    the usability focus for all developers and to institute the proper tasks and procedures to ensure that the usability
    efforts are maintained throughout the project.
</p>
<p>
    The Usability Design and Evaluation Plan is designed as a “living document” to be reviewed, updated, and expanded
    during the course of solution development.
</p>
<h4>
    Engagement Overview
</h4>
<p>
    The ABC Company is a leader in the communication business. They wish to expand their marketing to alternate channels,
    such as using kiosks in supermarkets and retail stores. This project is an attempt to move in that direction. The
    company also plans to expand their customer base to the US federal government by using similar kiosks in Post Offices
    across the country.
</p>
<p>
    The new ABC Kiosk is based on requirements that examined the current system and future needs. As a result, a system is
    defined that will move users from the current, human-assisted solution to an interactive, computer-based solution. The
    current solution is a manual method of purchasing ABC products and services at a kiosk-like booth located at a handful
    of BigStore Super Stores.
</p>
<p>
    The proposed solution encourages consumers to purchase services at automated, self-service kiosks to be located in
    2,400 BigStore Super Stores throughout the U.S. To perform this task, the consumer must be able to identify,
    communicate, and select the desired service; enter sufficient personal and preferential information to be able to
    purchase the service and have it installed; and place the order and indicate payment option. Other functions of the
    system include marketing the ABC services in a manner that will provide the user with the experience of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Seeing and hearing promos
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Sampling services through a mix of live and canned samples
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Listening to CD-quality audio, that also include captions and volume considerations
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>Interacting in all modes (keyboard, touch screen, perhaps voice command, etc.) with the display 
<h4>
    User-Centered Design Process
</h4>
<p>
    User-centered design is an industry leading approach for designing competitive ease-of-use into the total user
    experience with applications. It ensures that products are easy to set up, easy to learn, easy to use, easy to upgrade,
    engaging, intuitive, and integrated. It involves having a multidisciplinary team design the solution, starting with the
    externals, everything the user sees, hears and touches. Continuous user input is gathered via user-centered design user
    feedback methods that address understanding users, evaluating design, and assessing competitiveness. For User-Centered
    Design, you should describe the audience using the product. After the target audience is described, finding the
    solution for the following questions is important.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        What do you want the product to do for you?
    </li>
    <li>
        In what sort of environment will you be using the product?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are your priorities in using this software? For example, what functions will you be using most often?
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Usability Goals
</h4>
<p>
    The usability goals of the system are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To provide an engaging self-service kiosk experience to the consumer that meets or exceeds the needs of
        ABC/affiliates customers
    </li>
    <li>
        To allow ABC/affiliates to meet or exceed customers’ ordering needs through use of a kiosk system that: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Allows consumers to “walk up and use” the system without prior training and without the need for human
                assistance
            </li>
            <li>
                Is easy to use
            </li>
            <li>
                Is satisfying to the user
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To test the design so far, the team puts together a preliminary version called a <strong>prototype</strong>. Prototypes
    can be as simple as pieces of paper with proposed screen designs sketched on them, or as developed as finished
    products. A prototype may not have all the function that will be in the product, but it has enough to test some part of
    the design. Test participants recruited from the target audience try out the prototype, and their task performance,
    reactions, and comments help the designers decide what to keep and what to change about the design. The design goes
    into a cycle of modification and re-testing until it meets functional and usability criteria.<br />
    Area usability goal that addressed the usability of the accessibility features of a system would:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Allow people with a variety of disabilities (including hearing, vision and mobility disabilities) to use the
            system as effectively as people without disabilities and limiting the need for any special assistive
            technologies. For example, personal ear phones may still need to be provided by a blind user, but would not
            require a complete screen reader.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            To allow people with disabilities to “walk up and use’ the system without the need for assistance
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Usability Features
</h4>
<h5>
    “Walk-up-and-use”
</h5>
<p>
    In the current human-assisted, non-automated solution, consumers may not know what questions to ask to gain sufficient
    information to order their services at the kiosk. In other words, they may not know what they need to know in this new
    technological arena. Furthermore, users may feel intimidated by being forced to interact with a human in this domain,
    especially since they may know very little about the services being offered. This can be embarrassing for many
    consumers. By providing a “walk-up-and-use” interactive computer experience, users are free to explore the options at
    their own pace and not feel pressured to order until they are ready. They will be likely to approach the kiosk several
    times without the fear of being embarrassed in public by their lack of knowledge about the services. They may gather
    information on one visit and return to order the services on their next visit to BigStore.
</p>
<p>
    By providing users with a simple solution that can be easily navigated without the use of a manual and without the need
    of prior domain or kiosk experience, the user can order wireless services successfully, in private, and relatively fast
    while completing other shopping tasks at the same time. In other words, the user drives the system rather than having
    the system drive the user.
</p>
<p>
    Some user interface design techniques that will be used to assist the consumer in using the system without training or
    prior knowledge include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Visual, tactile and auditory feedback to confirm actions completed, including ordering
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The ability to go back and edit user-supplied information
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Having buttons that are clear, easy to find and accessible for persons of varying abilities. (e.g. low vision
            or blind, height flexibility). For example, all buttons should include Braille labels, be reachable, and should
            be simple to operate with one finger by not requiring tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Having displays that are easy to see for someone in a wheelchair. The displays need to provide auditory
            feedback for users who are blind.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Simple navigation paths and methods
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Assisting the user by means of visual and auditory help or a computerized “assistant”
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Displaying and explaining up front what the user can do with the system
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Easy to use
</h5>
<p>
    The same features that make the new ABC system “walk-up-and-use” also make it easier to use. Up front overview
    information and an interactive computer assistant or intelligent agent emphasizes to the consumer that no training is
    necessary, thus putting the user at ease early in the shopping experience.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    By putting the user in charge, instead of the system or the human booth attendant, users are able to more easily
    perform tasks when they want to perform them. In addition, they have the capability to handle multiple tasks
    simultaneously without losing data or having to back all the way out of an existing task. For example, a user can start
    entering initial information, get more detailed information about a service, and continue with the ordering process
    with no effort and no lost information.
</p>
<p>
    Other features of a graphical and interactive user interface that improve ease of use include consistently used icons,
    graphics, and information organization. Icons are symbolic representations of objects and information. They allow for
    quick and easy identification of the objects they represent without taking up much screen space. When combined with
    text, users find them much easier to find and work with than text alone.
</p>
<p>
    The ability to display graphics and audible descriptions not only allows the user interface to be more aesthetically
    pleasing, but also provides the ability to represent large quantities of data without having to show numbers. For
    example, pictures and audible descriptions of equipment can be displayed and spoken to provide a better understanding
    to consumers of what will be attached to their house or on their property in order to activate a service.
</p>
<p>
    Good user interface technique also allows designers to better organize information using real-life metaphors. Similar
    and familiar information can be easily identified when seen in logical groupings and by real-world objects. This allows
    users to find desired information more easily when they need it because they can tap into things they already know
    about.
</p>
<h4>
    Problem “Fix” Rate Model
</h4>
<p>
    Because ABC views ease of use as a market differentiator of public kiosk sites, ABC wishes to establish a market
    leadership in ease-of-use for its kiosks; therefore, 100% of the Severity 1 and 2 usability problems and 90% of the
    Severity 3 usability problems will be fixed<br />
    These are defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Severity Level 1. Users are unable to continue with a task or series of tasks due to the problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Severity Level 2. Users have considerable difficulty completing a task or series of tasks but are eventually
            able to continue. Users may fail to complete a task correctly.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Severity Level 3. Users have minor difficulty completing a task or series of tasks.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

            Project Managers or authorized representatives will review the proposed change and approve it for further
            investigation or reject it. XYZ will specify any charges for such investigation. If the investigation is
            authorized, the Project Managers or authorized representatives will sign the PCR, which will constitute
            approval for the investigation charges. XYZ will invoice GOV for any such charges as part of the monthly debit
            memo process. The investigation will determine the effect the implementation of the PCR will have on price,
            schedule, and other terms and conditions of the DOU.

<h4>
    Accessibility Considerations&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
    When considering usability for users with special needs, consideration of their characteristics can be useful. For
    example, physically impaired individuals face their primary difficulty in using the computer's input devices, or in
    handling storage media. Individuals in this group include individuals with congenital disabilities, spinal cord
    injuries, and progressive diseases, as well as individuals who are without the use of just a hand or arm. Some
    individuals who can use only one arm or hand (temporarily or permanently) or who use a headstick or mouthstick cannot
    activate multiple buttons or keys at the same time. Adding some options to the keyboard handling routines would allow
    many individuals to use the keyboard. Providing means to connect "alternate keyboards" would provide access for
    individuals who have more severe disabilities.
</p>
<p>
    Visually impaired individuals have their primary difficulties with the output display, although newer display-based
    input systems (e.g., mice, touchscreens) may also pose problems. This group includes individuals who have failing
    vision and individuals with partial vision, as well as those who are blind. The primary solution strategies involve
    providing a mechanism to connect alternate display or display translator devices to the computer, and providing
    alternatives to display-based input
