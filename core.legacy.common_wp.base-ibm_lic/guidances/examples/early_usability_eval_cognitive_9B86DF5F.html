    Cognitive Walkthrough<br />
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Executive Summary</strong><br />
    A cognitive walkthrough evaluation of the preliminary ABC product design was performed from October 7 to October 16,
    19xx. The focus was on the Order Entry function of Sales as the central function of the application. Most of the other
    functions support Sales or exploit the information gathered during the order entry process.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, the preliminary design of ABC is very good. The users did not have any major difficulties performing the Order
    Entry task. The layout of the Order Entry window was obvious to them and easy for them to follow. The terminology used
    for labeling field prompts and choices caused most of the problems. Many of these were resolved using terms agreed to
    by the users in a follow-on session and are given in the results in this report.
</p>
<p>
    ABC was found to have 135 usability issues or questions and 4 accessibility issues or questions. The following is a
    summary of the impact of these issues:<br />
    Twenty-six were rated high-impact issues or questions. Action must be taken prior to deployment to enable task
    completion and avoid extreme user dissatisfaction. Many of these are due to the early state of the prototype. They
    include ensuring that processes are well-defined and easy for users to do, avoiding serious errors caused by incorrect
    default values, and the like.
</p>
<p>
    There is a cumulative effect of many low- and moderate-impact issues that may have caused significant user
    dissatisfaction. Take this into consideration when allocating resources to enhance the design of the application.
</p>
<p>
    It is recommended that these usability and accessibility issues be corrected, that the prototype be enhanced starting
    with the Sales functions and other high usage functions, and that additional evaluations and usability tests with the
    intended users be done before the first installation of the application (see “Next Steps” on page 32).<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Introduction</b><br />
    Solution Overview<br />
    The ABC application is an integrated florist shop application that supports taking orders for wire delivery, local
    delivery, and carryout. It is designed to integrate with the common florist delivery networks, the florist shop’s
    accounting software, and a credit card verification service. It also supports a variety of business analysis reports
    and marketing support functions.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Method</b><br />
    Overview<br />
    The cognitive walkthrough evaluation involves observing user representatives performing selected tasks using a
    prototype or printed copy of the available windows for an application. A follow-on design session with user and
    development representatives occurred to resolve some of the issues that arose during the evaluation.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Participants</b><br />
    Ten DEF employees representing the users participated in the evaluation. These participants had an average tenure with
    DEF of 8.7 years and had been performing the tasks tested in this evaluation for an average of 4.3 years. Eight of the
    ten participants had a high school education; one participant had 2 years of college. One participant was visually
    impaired and uses a screen reader to access the application.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Tasks</b><br />
    Four scenarios were performed:<br />
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. Entering a customer order.<br />
        2. Completing the initial processing of the order that would send it over the network.<br />
        3. Making a change to the order.<br />
        4. Checking the status of the order.<br />
        <br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <b>Usability Impact Ratings (Measures)</b><br />
    Usability issues or questions are rated according to the level of impact they have on successful task completion and
    user satisfaction. There are three levels of impact:<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>High</b>: Prevents the user from successfully completing the task. Will cause extreme user dissatisfaction or make
    it easy for the user to make errors. Examples include:<br />
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        - Lack of a clearly defined process.<br />
        - Difficult-to-use widgets, forms.<br />
        - No initial focus set.<br />
        - Keyboard equivalents are not available for all mouse-centric tasks; all important visual widgets do not have
        meaningful alternative text.<br />
        - Extremely confusing navigation.<br />
        - No audio equivalents for significant visual material.<br />
        - No visual equivalents for significant audio material.<br />
        - High contrast system settings not supported.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <i>Action</i>: Must be corrected or resolved prior to deployment to enable task completion and avoid extreme user
    dissatisfaction.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Moderate</b>: Causes the user difficulty but task can be completed. Will cause user dissatisfaction. Examples
    include:<br />
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        - Confusing or inconsistent placement of controls.<br />
        - Somewhat confusing navigation.<br />
        - Confusing tabbing order.<br />
        - Nonstandard use of widgets and terminology.<br />
        - Information presented by the speech interface is confusing or misleading.<br />
        - Text generated through standard API’s.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <i>Action</i>: Should be corrected or resolved prior to deployment to facilitate task completion and avoid user
    dissatisfaction.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Low</b>: Minor problems that do not significantly affect task completion. May cause some user dissatisfaction,
    especially when considered in aggregate. Examples include:<br />
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        - Unappealing visual design.<br />
        - Unclear language.<br />
        - Punctuation.<br />
        - Redundant or useless information is presented by the speech interface.<br />
        - No standard or robust set of short-cut keys.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <i>Action</i>: Should be corrected or resolved prior to deployment to avoid user dissatisfaction.<br />
</p>
<p>
    In addition, participants completed questionnaires to assess their satisfaction with the software across a number of
    attributes.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Procedure</b><br />
    The participants took part in the evaluation individually. When brought into the evaluation setting, the participant
    was introduced to the concept of usability and accessibility evaluation and its goals. The participant was informed
    that the evaluation was a test of the software design, not the participant, and the participant’s individual
    performance would not be shared with his or her management. The participant was informed that he or she would take part
    in four scenarios to evaluate a software design. The participant was encouraged to think aloud as he or she walked
    through the scenarios and was given a short demonstration showing how the think-aloud method might be used when setting
    the time on a watch.
</p>
<p>
    The participant was then asked whether there were any questions. All questions were answered except those dealing with
    specifics of completing the four scenarios. The participant was shown how to signal the beginning of each task and how
    to signal when he or she thought the scenario was over. At the end of each scenario, the participant completed a
    written questionnaire to assess his or her perceptions of the application. After completing the questionnaire, the
    evaluation conductor answered questions from the participant and clarified the participant’s survey answers if they
    were not clear.
</p>
<p>
    Before leaving, the participant was reminded not to share the specifics of the study with his or her coworkers. The
    participant was also reminded that the software was in early design, so significant changes could be expected by the
    time the software arrived on the production floor many months later.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Results</b><br />
    The following graph shows mean satisfaction across tasks for a number of primary usability attributes.&nbsp;<br     clear="all" />

    <br clear="all" />
    The following usability issues were identified during the walkthrough, along with their impact and recommendation for
    correction. Note that references to the “requirements document” refer to the DEF New Product Development documents,
    primarily the Order Processing LD 2 document pages OP-13 - OP-16.

    </b><b>Recommendations for Improvement</b><br />
    Order Entry Menu Bar and Pull-Down Menus<br />
    This is a preliminary attempt to organize some of the actions available from the Order Entry window on the menu bar
    pull-down menus. These actions are taken from the list provided in the requirements document (page OP-16). Some of the
    actions from the list were not included because they are not used during order entry, were duplicates, or belonged in
    other windows such as the Method of Payment window.
</p>
<p>
    Note that any choices that are never available to users because the users do not have the authority to perform that
    action are removed. For example, if shop clerks are not allowed to void an order, then the <i>Void</i> action does not
    appear on their <i>Order</i> pull-down menu.

    <b>Next Steps</b><br />
    The user interface design for ABC has made an excellent start. It is recommended that the following additional
    usability and accessibility activities be performed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Conduct additional design sessions to lay out and review the windows for the various functions. This can save
            rework on the prototype, not to mention the developed product.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Add an accessibility activity. Use the appropriate Accessibility checklist to verify that all accessibility
            issues have been addressed during the design phase. Alternately, use Home Page Reader or similar technology to
            review the accessibility of the interface.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Develop a more complete design prototype of the key Sales functions: Order Entry (including the Payment Method
            window), Cash Register, Wire In, and Ticket Entry, along with key supporting functions such as Message Console
            and Customer Maintenance. Prototype these functions first to support early testing.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Add the additional functions to the prototype so these functions can also be tested with the appropriate users.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Conduct additional usability and accessibility tests with the new prototypes. Select users from outside DEF as
            test subjects. Ensure that the user’s background matches the scenarios being tested. For example, use flower
            shop owners/managers to test the Business Analysis and Reporting functions. Use shop owners/mangers or
            bookkeepers to test the accounting functions. Use store clerks to test the Sales functions.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
