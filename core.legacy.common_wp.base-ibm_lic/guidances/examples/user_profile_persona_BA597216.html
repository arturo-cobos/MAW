    <b><i>Robert</i></b> <i>– Director of Field Operations</i><br />
    <i>Company: Stewart Auto Glass</i><br />
    <i>Citizen of</i> <i>Great Britain</i><br />
    <i>45 years old</i><br />
    <i>Degrees: BS Industrial Engineering</i><br />
    <i>Personal concerns: being responsible and do everything with integrity</i><br />
    <i>Corporate concerns: transforming Stewart Auto Glass into a premier auto industry supplier</i><br />
    <br />
    <i>Robert is responsible for all field operations, including glass installation at fourteen auto manufacturer’s plants
    as well as the over 350 nationwide auto-glass retail outlets owned by Stewart Auto Glass. Robert loves the highly
    active work environment and the demands of the job. He thrives on rapid-fire situation management, in which he
    demonstrates his quick analytic ability and decisive management style.</i><br />
    <br />
    <i>Robert travels frequently and is very experienced with airline, hotel, and other travel situations. He expects the
    same degree of precision, reliability, and integrity from the travel industry as he expects from himself and his own
    organization. He is a discerning and demanding business traveler. He prefers to make all arrangements in advance, from
    his office, but is also flexible and skilled at using all available channels to alter arrangements during a trip. His
    company’s travel policies are set by their CFO and all travel is closely scrutinized.</i><br />
    <br />
    <i>Robert is most happy when he has successfully solved a business problem that others stumbled on. In fact, he has
    become so confident in his abilities, he feels that his goal of becoming COO is well within his grasp. He is confident
    but not cocky, realizing that continuing to deliver results is what will win him his coveted position. His job requires
    the daily use of a laptop computer and he is a fairly proficient “one-finger” typist. Both Robert and his company are
    open to adoption of new approaches and technologies, especially if it will make their lives easier.</i><br />
    <br />
    <i>Robert’s personal goals:</i><br />
    <i>A Sr. Executive position that commands prestige and respect</i><br />
    <i>A demanding job with great monetary reward and satisfaction potential</i><br />
    <i>A stable family situation that is supportive of his goals</i><br />
    <br />
    <i>Robert’s corporate goals:</i><br />
    <i>Chief Operations Officer within the next 5 – 7 years</i><br />
    <i>Help the company grow while still providing a “family-like” atmosphere</i><br />
    <i>Reduce the install defect rate by 30% over the next three years</i><br />
    <i>Cut warranty costs by 10% this year</i><br />
    <i>Narrow the gap on competitor BIE Glass to less than 5 points this year</i>

    <b>“</b><i>Too many places to look…Minutes are valuable to us”</i> - Annette<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Annette has an Associates Degree in Computer Science from the local community college. She is a 33-year-old mother of
    two. Raising two boys has taught her to take everything in stride and not be surprised about anything that happens. She
    finds these traits to be useful in her job.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Annette is a member of a communicative team of operators who sometimes use a chat facility to communicate. She has a
    fair understanding of IT concepts, gleaned from her five years of experience. She’s been in her current job for four
    years. At her workspace, Annette watches two monitors displaying multiple tools. She only watches for red and black
    alerts, for which she usually opens trouble tickets quickly. She may use the command line or other device-specific tool
    to check out the resource or application generating the event before opening the ticket. If she needs additional
    information about the resource, she will request it from another one of her tools. If she has questions about
    procedures to follow, she can access the team’s run book, found on the Web. In the midst of all the alerts, Annette is
    always mindful of the possibility of missing an alert. Even though she doesn’t know the specifics, she is well aware
    that this kind of mistake affects the company. Overall, the procedures are simple: look at the screen, respond to each
    black and red event, look up the procedures, follow them, and move on to the next one.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Before the end of her day, Annette documents each ticket she opened in the shift log. This is the only major reporting
    she does. She has a high amount of interaction with Eddie, the administrator supporting her tools, as well as others
    outside her team. Overall, Annette trusts her tools.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Avoid monotony on the job
    </li>
    <li>
        Use as little effort as possible to work the problems

services of the company’s business processes.
