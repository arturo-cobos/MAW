conceptual model, early design low-fidelity user interface prototype, the User-Interface Design Guidelines (if they already
exist) branding, and visual design collateral (as applicable) and a set of early usability test scenarios (cognitive
walkthroughs), you can follow a systematic approach for developing a User Interface Design Specification. These generic
steps can also be followed for projects which do not have uses cases or used an Object Orientated development approach
(i.e. projects based on business, functional, and non-functional requirements). You can follow these steps more or less
sequentially. Each is described in more detail below.

team uses the User Interface Design Specification to develop the UI interaction. In contrast, the business and test teams
often use this work product to validate the UI.

Development Guidelines to select which control attributes are required for business approval. In the ideal situation, this
document will be used to capture all the technical details including data source, initial value, enabling and visibility
logic, maximum length, event handling and error handling details. This assumes that all required supporting technical
documents such as data and object models are available. Decide what level of detail is needed for the first draft and add
these additional details through iterations of low-level design as the required supporting technical documents become
available.

    Since there may be more than one designer, in order to ensure consistency it is advisable to create a template to be
    shared by all designers. Start with the template attached; but tailor it to better meet your customerâ€™s needs.

</table>It is advisable that you determine the division of labor among designers prior to starting and then manage the plan
along the way. Some screens will probably be more complex than others, and therefore will require more detail. For best
results, have the original User Interface designer create the specification for a given screen since s/he will have more
background to accurately capture the design interaction.

    <tbody>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>Depending on the audience, you may need to have technical leads and business stakeholders review specification
drafts. During this stage, reviewers and approvers for each draft should be identified. For best results, reviewers must be
given adequate time to thoroughly review the draft by allotting them one half the time taken to create the draft. 
<p>
    Also, schedule an internal review after each writer has completed the first draft of one screen. This will help ensure
    consistency among writers and give writers an opportunity to compare experiences.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, include an approver stage since there may be feedback that you are given that you may wish to reject with good
    reason (such as out-of-scope functionality, previously agreed and resolved, etc.)

    <strong>Identify reviewers and approvers of work product</strong>

contacting them, with the stakeholders and the project manager.

</table>It is advisable that the client be asked to authorize development based on the accepted specification. This ensures
that the application to be delivered is based on a shared understanding. An acceptable form of authorization is an email
stating that the included document (e.g. user interface design embedded in a high-fidelity prototype) is approved. Projects
may use sign-off documents if desired.

</table>During testing, the test team may find a discrepancy between the User Interface Specification and the application.
If the development team did not follow the UI Design Specification, then it is their responsibility to update the code to
reflect the specification. In the event that the user interface is found to be incorrect, incomplete, or insufficiently
usable, the User Interface Specification should be updated. Again, the approver must be notified and provide approval.</td>
