    <strong>Prepare the List Of Functional Requirements for End User Evaluation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The list of requirements is screened for clarity and relevance to focus group participants with the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        If a requirement describes a system-actor interaction that requires no user input or output, it is removed from the
        list of use cases that will be evaluated.
    </li>
    <li>
        The requirements descriptions are reviewed for terminology so they will be clear and understandable to the focus
        group participants. It is important to note that if the focus group contains individuals who have disabilities that
        the requirements needs to be reviewed for accessibility also.
    </li>
    <li>
        The list is organized by discrete user subgroups. Actors identified in the requirements are matched with distinct
        user subgroups as identified in the user profile analysis (which was created during the system analysis effort).
        Discrepancies between actors and user profiles are noted and resolved. Users who have disabilities may span several
        user subgroups and should be included in focus groups as appropriate.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Identify User Groups for Participation in the Study</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The user profile analysis creates profiles of the intended user subgroups of the new system. The different user
    profiles are built on the basis of the expected tasks to be completed, the physical environment of the new system, the
    end userâ€™s prior knowledge and experience with the legacy system (if it exists), and end user cognitive characteristics
    and aptitudes.
</p>
<p>
    Users that match these profiles are then selected randomly to participate in the focus group sessions. Separate focus
    group sessions should be conducted for each user profile set if the system affects large subgroups of users. A focus
    group session should have approximately 12 to 15 participants. This focus group should represent a diverse population
    and should include persons who have disabilities. If the focus group includes people who have disabilities, the method
    for conducting interviews and any surveys needs to accommodate the special needs (large print, sign language
    interpreter, etc.) of the participants. If the potential population of users who have disabilities is large, a focus
    group based on these users may be appropriate given the need for technical accommodation.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conduct a User Focus Session to Capture Group Metrics</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In a user focus session, the list of use cases is validated with end users serving as focus group session participants.
    The list is provided to the participants, and the participants are asked to review and revise the list, if necessary,
    to reflect the activities they perform on their job. Specifically, this is done by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Participants determine whether there are tasks that are no longer performed on the job. If there is unanimous
        consensus, then the requirements are dropped from the list.
    </li>
    <li>
        Participants are then asked to rate the remaining requirements from high to low based on how often the user tasks
        identified in the use case are performed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Participants are then asked to rate the requirements based on their current level of satisfaction with the user
        activities identified in the requirement. For requirements that rate low on satisfaction, participants are asked to
        identify reasons for their low satisfaction and brainstorm ways that might improve it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Participants are then asked to identify functional requirements that may be missing from the list of requirements.
        Participants should be asked to focus on accessibility requirements as a subset of functional requirements. These
        functional requirements are then phrased in terms of a new requirement which&nbsp;is then rated on the basis of
        satisfaction and frequency of use.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Analyze Focus Group Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The satisfaction and frequency of use scores provided by focus group participants can be weighted and combined to form
    a composite score. The composite scores can then be ranked to show relative significance between requirements scores.
    If a new requirement is identified or there are requirements that are questionable in terms of whether they are needed
    for the new system, this information is to be shared with the requirements team for further analysis and discussion.
