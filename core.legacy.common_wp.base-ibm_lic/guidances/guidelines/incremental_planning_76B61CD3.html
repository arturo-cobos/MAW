    1&nbsp;Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Working software gives a really reliable indication of progress. There is little scope for error or over-optimism.
</p>
<p>
    Decisions about what should be included in each increment, that is in each programming cycle, each Build cycle, and if
    appropriate each Release cycle, are consequently very important. On the one hand we want to make quick and visible
    progress on important parts of the system. On the other we want to ensure that the project is built on good
    foundations, that we do not just create the illusion of progress, and that we build first those parts that make the
    overall project go fastest.
</p>
<p>
    Incremental planning is about the choice of what to build in each programming cycle, build cycle and release.
</p>
<p>
    There is a fundamental tradeoff between the short and the long term, between:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Building the easiest, most valuable functionality (biggest bang for the buck), and
    </li>
    <li>
        Building a base for the harder functionality and the harder nonfunctional requirements that demand more
        infrastructure and more components (mitigating risk).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The right balance depends on the circumstances of the project. Sometimes it is necessary to deliver or at least
    demonstrate valuable functionality to help justify the project. Sometimes the clear priority is to build a solid
    long-term base. It is almost always necessary to do some of each.
</p>
<p>
    Incremental planning is done top down. First the contents of a release cycle are defined, at least in outline. Then as
    each release cycle starts, the number and goals of the build cycles are defined, and then as each build cycle starts
    the number and goals of the programming cycles.
</p>
<p>
    A release (unlike a build cycle) has to be useful to some users, so functionality plays a bigger role. We give no
    further guidance here except to note the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Sometimes the date some functionality has to be delivered is more important than the exact contents of a release.
        In this case, plan a fall back position and define the early build cycles so that they establish the fall back.
    </li>
    <li>
        Especially when under pressure, consider the needs of different categories of user separately. The three
        requirements with the highest priorities may be for different users. Yet supplying all three may not really satisfy
        anyone. Each needs their top priority plus some other lesser items. It may be better to gear a release to a single
        category of users.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Assuming the first release is defined, or there is only one release, here is a simple procedure, which gives some
    guidance in choosing what to build first. The first three steps can be done in parallel.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    2.1&nbsp; Risk Mitigation
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        List and prioritize the risks on the release (or the project if there is only one release).
    </li>
    <li>
        For each risk, identify what could be built that would mitigate the risk.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each case, identify prerequisite components.&nbsp; For example, suppose risk A would be completely removed if X
        could be built and demonstrated.&nbsp; But perhaps X cannot work unless Y and Z are in place.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.2&nbsp; Early Desirable Functionality
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        List and prioritize desirable early functionality.&nbsp; (What would look good at the management review?&nbsp;
        Which use cases? Which nonfunctional requirements?)
    </li>
    <li>
        For each item, identify prerequisite components.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.3&nbsp; Team Learning
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        List and prioritize the gaps between the experience of the project team (both individually and as a group) and the
        needs of the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each gap, identify what could be built early to close the gap.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    (Even if everyone in the team is experienced they may not have worked together before.&nbsp; It can be valuable to go
    through a small build cycle simply to practice working together as a team and to familiarize everyone with the
    development procedures.)
</p>
<h4>
    2.4&nbsp; Choose the Increment Goals
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Establish what it is possible to build early.
    </li>
    <li>
        Taking the possibly conflicting priorities in points 1-3 into account, choose the goals for the first build cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Try to meet several goals with each component.&nbsp; For example, it is very rare to build a component solely to
        close a gap in the experience of the team.&nbsp; Almost always this is a contributing factor in the choice of a
        component that has some other value.&nbsp; Or it may result in an extension to the definition of a component that
        has some other justification.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Projects vary in the precision with which they can specify later build cycles.&nbsp; In some the requirements are
    deliberately left open and this has an obvious effect on the goals of later build cycles.&nbsp; In others, the
    requirements are defined early and put under change control.&nbsp; The number and goals of the build cycles can be
    determined with fair precision.
</p>
<p>
    Full incremental planning depends on the architecture of the system.&nbsp; Only when the structure of the system is
    reasonably understood can detailed dependencies be understood and a sensible progression through successive subsystems
    be proposed.&nbsp; The architecture also influences whether it is more sensible to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Build breadth first, establishing skeleton versions of all the subsystems and then elaborating each in successive
        build cycles, or
    </li>
    <li>
        To progress by successively adding more or less complete subsystems.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both are possible within the managerial framework defined by the delivery process.&nbsp; The architecture also
    determines how and to what extent large pieces of work can be done in parallel.&nbsp; Generally though, given knowledge
    of the architecture and the relative importance of the functionality, an obvious order of construction suggests itself.
</p>
<p>
    At all levels it is valuable to characterize the goals of an increment by a few short phrases, as well as giving more
    detailed references to use cases, nonfunctional requirements, subsystems, and error reports. The phrases help
    stakeholders and developers alike to grasp the essential goals of the increment.&nbsp; For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Make the read-only data connection to the (legacy) customer information system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add a printing subsystem, so that complete invoices can be printed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Extend the claims subsystem so that it covers health claims.
    </li>
    <li>
        Build one use case end-to-end.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fix all errors reported up to end January.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Sometimes the short phrases sum up the real target of the increment more honestly than a more detailed document.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, ensure that the goals of build cycles and programming cycles are completed. Incremental development means we
    finish building part of the system, and then finish building another part.&nbsp; It does not mean leaving everything
    half finished.
