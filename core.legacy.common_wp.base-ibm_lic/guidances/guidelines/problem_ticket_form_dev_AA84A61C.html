    This work product is a multi part form that is completed at various stages of the problem lifecycle.<br />
</p>
<p>
    1. When a problem is first reported to the helpdesk the Problem ID is allocated in accordance with the problem
    management system procedures. The Caller information, the General Information and the Recording Information are
    completed. In many IBM sites and helpdesks an automated problem management tracking system may be used in which case
    the Recording Information may be completed automatically.<br />
    2. The Update Summary Information is partly completed by the helpdesk. The assignee details are entered, the status and
    current severity are also completed and the date and time of alteration is completed. With an automatic system the date
    and time will be entered by the system.<br />
    3. The assignee group is responsible for completing the remainder of the Update Summary Information. This includes the
    resolver group name, resolver name, telephone number, and date and time accepted. The resolver will complete the cause
    code, fix change number and century-21 flag, if the error is a result of a Year 2000 change.<br />
    4. The Resolution Information is completed by following the instructions provided in Resolution Actions section given
    below.<br />
    5. When the resolver has completed all the work necessary to fix the problem the helpdesk is informed and the Closure
    Information is completed.<br />
    6. At any time the user can add additional information to the user Information field.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Resolution Actions<br />
</h4>
<p>
    <b>Performing Immediate Action</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    The Problem Resolution is initiated almost as soon as the developer takes ownership of the emergency fix when it is
    used to document the problem impact. After completing the Change/Problem /Date/Time information the Application
    Developer gathers information to assist in determining where the error occurred and documents the resolution in this
    work product to keep a record of all significant information, this will include a brief description of the
    problem.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The resolution section is next updated once the Developer has decided upon the changes that have to be made to resolve
    the emergency. In effect this acts as the documented design of solution.<br />
</p>
<p>
    This work product is next used to record information whilst completing the following tasks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Make System Change Components – Updated to reflect the component changes.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Test Changes – Record test results
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Implemented Changes – Record details of who was contacted to assist in implementing changes, times, etc.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Arrange Production Run/System Restarts - Record details of whom were contacted to assist in implementing
            changes, times, etc.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The work product is then used to record the results from production output and to update it to say who was contacted,
    and any other information that may be necessary for follow-on action to be taken.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Performing Follow-on Action</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    To perform any follow-on action the developer will need to review the solution section of this work product to
    understand the problem. It can then be used to assess the effectiveness of the emergency fix and to record identified
    Job Log errors, Output errors, and System Data errors.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The work product is then updated when identifying the problem cause. This involves a more thorough investigation of the
    problem than was possible whilst the immediate fix was being implemented. As a result it will be possible to determine
    if any other changes to the system are required and if they are then the work product should be updated to say what
    they are.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Finally during this activity, potential data recovery action should be identified, and if there is any, then what it is
    should be recorded.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The work product is next used to notify appropriate organisations of any follow-on action during the following tasks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Where the need for a Change Requirement has been identified and is either a separate problem within the current
            system or from another one, then the Developer raises a new Problem Ticket Form.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            When the original problem has been identified as being a separate problem within the current system or being
            from another one, then the developer should raise a new Problem Ticket Form.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            When creating appropriate communication, the details of who was contacted in the course of resolving the Fix
            and other information necessary for retrospective action to be taken should be recorded.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In order to provide a permanent fix for the problem and ensure that the system runs as it is supposed to, a number of
    tasks have to be completed.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Initially the Problem Ticket Form is used when confirming the scope of the project or work to be undertaken, developing
    a work plan and assigning appropriate resources and assets, when it is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Reviewed to confirm the nature of the problem and what follow on work is required.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Used as an input to enable a work plan to be produced.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The problem is then recreated, reviewed, and the cause of the problem is identified. An assessment of the defects is
    carried out and an impact analysis statement is produced.
</p>
<p>
    Any temporary programs that were written to assist in these tasks are then removed from the system. The Problem Ticket
    Form is used to both provide and record information associated with this work as defined below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The description of the problem contained within the Problem Ticket Form is used to enable the developer to try
            to recreate the original problem. Any steps or extra resources used are recorded in the Problem Ticket Form.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The problem cause recorded in the Problem Ticket Form is reviewed and verified. If the cause is not that
            recorded then the Problem Ticket Form is updated to reflect this.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The emergency fix developer will have recorded the impact of the problem on the system, other systems, and work
            in progress in the Problem Ticket Form. This is reviewed and the Problem Ticket Form is updated accordingly.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Problem Ticket Form will contain information as to the nature of the problem and what was done about it.
            The developer will check to ensure that there is a problem that does require corrective maintenance. If it does
            not, then a service request is submitted to Program Management for further action.
