            The vision, aims and goals regarding metadata. This artifact clearly delineates client plans and intentions
            regarding metadata management and use. It is used to document and describe the steps the organization desires
            to undertake to reach their ultimate goals. For example, this artifact could be used to describe an incremental
            strategy where the metadata capabilities are implemented&nbsp;in a series of progressive, incremental steps
            starting with a Business Information Directory and proceeding toward a full repository that embraces the entire

                            data element cross-references, etc).

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            support both the client’s operational systems environment and their informational (business
                            intelligence) environment.
                        </div>
                    </li>

            <li>
                <div>
                    It is possible that the organization intends to do nothing—that is, the organization does not intend to
                    have a metadata facility of any sort. This kind of decision, its implications and the rationale should
                    be documented in this work product.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The intended high-level functional tasks that a metadata management facility would be used to perform—describe
            at a high-level what the metadata facility is envisioned to do. Typically these capabilities are categorized as
            business tasks, operational/administrative tasks or technical tasks. Examples of technical tasks which a
            metadata management facility would be used for include: designing BI solution data stores (ODS, DW, Data marts,
            etc.), designing/developing data capture/conversion/transformation systems and facilities, or managing the
            definition and description of the contents of the BI solution data stores. Examples of
            operational/administrative tasks include creating data warehouse access/usage statistics, defining production
            system environment schedules and configurations. Examples of business tasks where a metadata management
            facility would be used include: discovering what data exists, determining how to use the data, creating
            decision support queries or reporting objects.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The critical success factors and implications of introducing a metadata management facility—define what
            organizational, business process, policy or practice changes are likely to be needed given a metadata
            management facility is established.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Typically the most significant consequence of a metadata management facility is its impact on the way the
            business organization manages the gathering, definition, maintenance and sharing of its metadata. With the
            introduction of a metadata management facility comes the creation of a metadata management organization
            framework. This framework is used to establish the context for collecting metadata, maintaining its accuracy
            and integrity and making it available to authorized technical and business users. Collecting metadata is an
            on-going activity. Metadata is captured during all stages of systems development.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>
                    A metadata management organization framework consists of the following elements:
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            The description of the organizational responsibilities for metadata; the lines of
                            responsibility, accountability and authority.
                        </div>
