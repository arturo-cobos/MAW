needed, during the Build Cycle for a specific release. Modifications may also be made while developing one release that may
apply to the solution as a whole or to its future releases.

the complexity of the solution as a whole and as pertains to a specific release of the solution; and the solution’s
requirements. Consequently, testing defined and conducted for the overall solution and per each of its releases may entail
all or some of the testing levels listed in the table below and may for some projects be expanded to include those not
listed, for example, Stress Testing. From this perspective all test levels listed in the table can be considered optional
as their specific applicability varies per each project and its defined scope.

</table>The concept of completeness of a work product instance depends largely on whether the work product will be finished
in this phase of the project, or iterated for additional work in later phases. If the work product is to be iterated later,
it will only be partially complete at the end of this phase. Regardless of whether each work product instance is fully or
partially completed at this time, the content of the work products should be fully included in the deliverable being
produced.
