    This document will be comprised of information formatted for delivery to the client extracted from the following work
    products:
</p>
<p>
    <u>Business Rules Catalog</u> – used to define the business rules that must be implemented in the system.&nbsp; This is
    typically provided as a list of rules with at most a short description at this point.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Change Cases</u> – are optionally included and are typically identified as out of scope requirements so there is no
    confusion if the circumstances arise where they will actually have to be implemented.&nbsp; Not all change cases need
    be included if client involvement will not be needed to resolve them.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Non-functional Requirements</u> – identifies the basic requirements related to performance, scalability,
    availability and other technical issues that the system is required to meet.&nbsp; Additional business constraints may
    also be included in this section.&nbsp; This section consists of a list of the non-functional requirements and a short
    description, measurable criteria is not required at this point.
</p>
<p>
    <u>System Context</u> – provides a graphical representation of the various other systems that the new system will need
    to interact with in order to function.&nbsp; All other systems need to be identified as well as the types of
    information that will be passed back and forth.&nbsp; Optionally different user types may also be shown on this
    diagram.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Usability Requirements</u> – identifies requirements related to usability which may impact system design or cause
    other non-functional requirements to be established in order to meet these requirements.&nbsp; The usability
    requirements are represented as a list that mirrors what the users have been requesting regarding the user
    interface.&nbsp; Details should be provided beyond “the system is easy to use” but need not provided down to a
    measurable level yet.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Use Case Model</u> – identifies the functional requirements the solution needs to provide.&nbsp; The initial set of
    use cases is typically developed as a list showing subject area, actor, use case name and description.&nbsp;
    Definitions for all actors should also be included and the scope of the overall list should be as complete as
    possible.&nbsp; The use case model may optionally include a graphical representation showing the relationships between
    uses cases as well as which actors can execute each use case.
</p>
<p>
    <u>User Profiles</u> – provides details on the various types of typical users of the system.&nbsp; Categories should be
    established that cover the entire expected user population with general characteristics identified for each
    group.&nbsp; Although it not necessary to fully document each group at this time the minimum of computer experience,
    subject matter expertise, language and other special needs should be document at this time.
</p>
<p>
    The final document will be delivered to the customer in a reproducible format.&nbsp; The final report may also be
    delivered in hard copy format printed in a single, bound document.
