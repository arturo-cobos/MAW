<p>
    According to UML,a Class is a subtype of both EncapsulatedClassifier and metaclass Class, which brings to a Class the
    capability to have an internal structure and ports. Also, a component is defined by UML as a subtype of Class.
    Therefore, within RUP context, we refer to both <strong>components</strong> and <strong>classes</strong> as being
    structured classes.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Part" name="Part"></a>Part
</h5>
<p>
    An instance of a structured class contains an object or set of objects corresponding to each part. All such instances
    are destroyed when the containing structured class instance is destroyed.
</p>
<p>
    The example below shows two possible views of the Car class:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        In figure (a), <strong>Car</strong> is shown as having a composition association with role name
        <strong>rear</strong> to a class <strong>Wheel</strong> and a composition association with role name
        <strong>e</strong> to a class <strong>Engine</strong>. Any instance of class <strong>Engine</strong> can be linked
        to an arbitrary number of instances of class <strong>Wheel</strong>.<br />
        <br />
         In figure (b), the same is specified. However, in addition, in figure (b) it is specified that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>rear</strong> and <strong>e</strong> belong to the internal structure of the class
                <strong>Car</strong>. This allows specification of detail that holds only for instances of the
                <strong>Wheel</strong> and <strong>Engine</strong> classes within the context of the class
                <strong>Car</strong>, but which does not hold for <strong>wheels</strong> and <strong>engines</strong> in
                general.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                within the context of class <strong>Car</strong>, the instance playing the role of <strong>e</strong> may
                only be connected to two instances playing the role of <strong>rear</strong>. In addition, the instances
                playing the <strong>e</strong> and <strong>rear</strong> roles may only be linked if they are roles of the
                same instance of class <strong>Car</strong>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
            In other words, additional constraints apply on the instances of the classes <strong>Wheel</strong> and
            <strong>Engine</strong>, when they are playing the respective roles within an instance of class
            <strong>Car</strong>. These constraints are not true for instances of <strong>Wheel</strong> and
            <strong>Engine</strong> in general. Other <strong>wheels</strong> and <strong>engines</strong> may be
            arbitrarily linked as specified in the figure (a).<br />
            <br />
        </li>
    </ul>

    Example: Parts playing their roles inside a structured class
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Connector" name="Connector"></a>Connector
</h5>
<p>
    A connector is an instance of relationship between two parts in a structured class. It is a link to allow
    communication. Connectors may be implemented by ordinary associations or by transient relationships, such as procedure
    parameters, variables, global values, or other mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
    The internal "wiring" of a structured class is specified with assembly connectors and delegation connectors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Within the implementation of a structured class, <strong>assembly connectors</strong> connect ports of different
        parts. A message sent on a port of one structured class is received on a connected port of another structured
        class. A set of parts may be wired together through their ports. A part need not know anything about other parts,
        except that they exist and satisfy the constraints on connected ports. Communication among structured classes is
        modeled by their ports.
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A <strong>delegation connector</strong> connects an external port of a structured class with a port on one of its
        internal parts. A message received by the external port is passed to the port on the internal part; a message sent
        by the internal port is passed to the external port and then to the structured class connected to it.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Port" name="Port"></a>Port
</h3>
<p>
    A port is a structural feature of a structured class. Encapsulation can be increased by forcing communications from
    outside the structured class to pass through ports obeying declared interfaces, which brings additional precision in
    specification and interconnection for that structured class.
</p>
<p>
    The required and provided interfaces of a port specify everything that is necessary for interactions through that
    interaction point. If all interactions of a structured class with its environment are achieved through ports, then the
    internals of the structured class are fully isolated from the environment. This allows such a structured class to be
    used in any context that satisfies the constraints specified by its ports.
</p>
<p>
    There is no assumption about how a port is implemented. It might be implemented as an explicit object, or it might be
    merely a virtual concept that does not explicitly appear in the implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of ports are provided below:
</p>
<h5>
    Example 1
</h5>
<p align="center">
    &nbsp;<img height="226" alt="Ports" src="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/guidances/concepts/resources/ports.jpg" width="548" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Port of an Engine being used by a Car and a Boat
</p>
<p>
    The figure above shows a class <strong>Engine</strong> with a port <strong>p</strong> and two interfaces:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A provided interface <strong>powertrain</strong>, which specifies the services that the engine offers at this port
        (i.e., the operations and receptions that are accessible by communication arriving at this port).
    </li>
    <li>
        A required interface <strong>power</strong>, which specifies the services that the engine expects its environment
        to provide.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At port <strong>p</strong>, the <strong>Engine</strong> class is completely encapsulated; it can be specified without
    any knowledge of the environment the engine will be embedded in. As long as the environment obeys the constraints
    expressed by the provided and required interfaces of the engine, the engine will function properly.<br />
    <br />
     To illustrate that, two uses of the <strong>Engine</strong> class are shown in this example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>Car</strong> class connects port <strong>p</strong> of the engine to a set of wheels by means of the
        <strong>axle</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Boat</strong> class connects port <strong>p</strong> of the engine to a propeller by means of the
        <strong>shaft</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As long as the interaction between the <strong>Engine</strong> and the part linked to its port <strong>p</strong> obeys
    the constraints specified by the provided and required interfaces, the engine will function as specified, whether it is
    an engine of a car or an engine of a boat.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, even if <strong>Engine</strong> had other declared ports, such as a port <strong>f</strong> for
    <strong>Fuel Consumption</strong>, the wheels of a car and the propeller of a boat would still access the
    <strong>Engine</strong> through port <strong>p</strong>. Port <strong>f</strong> would be of interest of a fuel meter,
    regardless of what kind of fuel is being used and what kind of fuel meter cars and boats might have.
</p>
<h5>
    Example 2
</h5>
<p>
    This example of ports is based on Java Logging API, which is a package that provides the following classes and
    interfaces of the Java 2 platform's core logging facilities, among others:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Logger</strong> is the main entity on which applications make logging calls. It is used to log messages for
        a specific system or application component
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Level</strong> gives a guide to the importance and urgency of a log message
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Filter</strong> provides fine grain control of what is logged, beyond the control provided by the log
        levels
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Handler</strong> takes messages from a Logger and exports them to different destinations (memory, output
        streams, consoles, files and sockets)
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Formatter</strong> provides support for formatting log records
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Those classes and interfaces are involved in two important kinds of collaborations. Some classes and interfaces are
    used to write to the log while others are used to administrate the log. The figure below shows two different
    collaborations that clients and administrators have with the log, modeled as UML collaborations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Writing</strong> collaboration, where the <strong>LogClient</strong> role connects to the
        <strong>LogWriter</strong> role in order to write to the log.
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Administration</strong> collaboration, where the <strong>LogAdministrator</strong> role connects to the
        <strong>LogController</strong> role in order to access the log and change log settings.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
    &nbsp;<img height="92" alt="Collaborations" src="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/guidances/concepts/resources/collaborations.gif" width="592" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Different collaborations that clients and administrators have with the log
</p>
<p>
    One possible UML 2.0 representation to model the logging services and its collaborations would be using a component
    with ports and declared interfaces, as shown in the figure below:
</p>
<p align="center">
    &nbsp;<img height="165" alt="Ports" src="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp-ibm/guidances/concepts/resources/ports1.gif" width="533" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Java Logging API package being implemented as a component with provided interfaces grouped into ports
</p>
<p>
    In the Java Logging API specification, some of the logging services were implemented as classes and others as
    interfaces. In this example, we model each of those services as provided interfaces, which could be realized by parts
    inside the component. The two different kinds of behavior related to <strong>Writing</strong> and
    <strong>Administration</strong> collaborations mentioned above could be represented by interfaces logically grouped
    into ports. Therefore, we have:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Logger</strong> and <strong>Level</strong> interfaces grouped into <strong>LogWriter</strong> port. Those
        interfaces are accessed by log clients to write to the log<strong>.</strong>
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <strong>Handler</strong>, <strong>Filter</strong> and <strong>Formatter</strong> interfaces grouped into
        <strong>LogController</strong> port. Those interfaces are accessed by log administrators to access the log and
        change log settings.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This modeling alternative brings a separation of concerns, by logically grouping interfaces into different ports. We
    have additional precision for the component specification and the interconnection it can have with the external world.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Modeling" name="Modeling"></a>Modeling
</h3>
<p>
    During design, classes and components may be decomposed into collections of connected parts that may be further
    decomposed in turn.
</p>
<p>
    A <strong>composite structure diagram</strong> can be used to show the decomposition of a structured class. As an
    example, the figure below shows a composite structure diagram for the box office in the ticketing system. This class is
    decomposed into three parts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A ticket seller interface
    </li>
    <li>
        A performance guide that retrieves performances according to date and other criteria
    </li>
    <li>
        A set of databases that contain the data on the performances and the tickets.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each part interacts through a well-defined interface specified by its ports. The entire box office interacts with the
    outside through a port. Messages on this port are dispatched to the ticket seller class, but the internal structure of
    the box office class is hidden from outside clients.
