    The level of business process detail that is initially created by a team of business analysts might be insufficient for
    follow-on work that focuses on realizing the business process.&nbsp; In that case, the process must be further
    decomposed until it is fit for the required purpose.&nbsp; This guideline provides some advice regarding approaches to
    process decomposition.
</p>
<p>
    As is&nbsp;discussed in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/business_process_decomposition_70D1DA00.html" guid="_0XDGMEozEd6D_7XK49c0nw">Concept: Business Process Decomposition</a>,&nbsp;business process decomposition can
    result in a hierarchy of processes and sub-processes, which eventually end in leaf-level sub-processes that&nbsp;leave
    us dealing with&nbsp;fine-grained user actions.&nbsp; The following figure is duplicated from that concept to
    illustrate&nbsp;a possible process hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img alt="" src="./../../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/bus_proc_decomp_2.gif" width="549" height="262" />
</p>
<p>
    Each level of process decomposition&nbsp;can involve&nbsp;a drill-down through the organizational functional structure
    that was used to describe the previous level of the process.&nbsp; So, a process description might involve the
    interaction between business domains, which are the largest concepts used to describe business functional
    structure.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the next level, the sub-process that is the responsibility of a given domain might be
    analyzed in terms of the interactions between the functional areas/business systems that comprise the domain.&nbsp; Yet
    another round of decomposition might find us examining how the sub-sub-process which is the responsibility of a given
    business system might be realized by interactions between the business workers the business system owns.
</p>
<p>
    The recursive nature of the process decompositional drill-down calls out for a system-of-systems approach, where the
    behaviors (processes) at each level of the overall system (that is, the business) are discovered using a consistent
    method.&nbsp; Further, the transition from one level of the process to the next needs to be managed consistently.&nbsp;
    Rational's <a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247368.html?Open" target="_blank">Model Driven Systems
    Development</a> (MDSD) method is a useful&nbsp;approach for achieving a high degree of consistency in representation
    and technique as you progress through your process decomposition.
</p>
<p>
    As we decompose the business processes, there are several things to consider and document:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Actors</strong> -- Each level of process description potentially will&nbsp;have a different set of
    actors.&nbsp; At the top-most level, the actors are the actors which interact with the enterprise as a whole.&nbsp; At
    the next level down, as we isolate (for example) a given domain to understand how its functional areas interact to
    realize the sub-process for which it is responsible, the enterprise actors remain -- but the other domains also become
    actors!&nbsp; Upon isolating a functional area for the next round of process analysis, the actors (for that specific
    analysis) become the actors the domain dealt with -- plus the other functional areas within the domain!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Events</strong> -- We need to identify the events that trigger a process or sub-process.&nbsp; Identifying a
    process (or certain of its steps)&nbsp;as being event-driven can provide hints&nbsp;regarding requirements that any
    automated implementation support (for example) publish-and-subscribe&nbsp;event notification.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Business entities</strong> that are involved in, or transformed by, the business process.&nbsp; This knowledge
    is important for subsequent specification of service messages and service operation signatures.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Opportunities for automation.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; All steps in a business process are not well-suited for
    automation, and others certainly are.&nbsp; Be focused on discriminating between these two.&nbsp; Lack of
    discrimination can lead to wasted effort on the one hand, and missed opportunity on the other.&nbsp; One caution,
    though -- be aware that what might not be a good candidate for automation today, might be a great candidate
    later.&nbsp; Be sure to flag manual process steps that are particularly costly or error-prone.&nbsp; They might be good
    candidates for consideration at a later time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Geographical distribution</strong> among the entities that are involved in executing a process.&nbsp; Spatial
    distribution of processing elements can impose more taxing non-functional requirements on process elements.&nbsp; The
    sooner this is realized, the better.
