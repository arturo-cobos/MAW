    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Traditionally, business activities have been planned and measured with a very strong focus on financial performance. On
    the one hand, managers might define both financial and nonfinancial objectives, while on the other hand they might be
    interested only in the outcome of the financial measures.&nbsp;This misalignment between objectives and measures leads,
    sadly, to undesirable yet predictable behavior.
</p>
<p>
    The modern enterprise does not only have to be competitive financially, but to be so on a variety of different fronts.
    Business goals must define more than just financial measures. They must also focus on, for example, employee
    satisfaction or customer success. Simply defining different business goals is not enough to ensure success, because
    certain goals might be measured or enforced more than others.
</p>
<p>
    Modeling business goals provides a technique for considering how the business strategy can be implemented in the short-
    and long-term and for defining a balanced set of measures to ensure that business processes support the strategy.
</p>
<p>
    The question that arises from this issue is: How do you implement strategy, particularly one that could require radical
    change?
</p>
<h3>
    Business Strategy and Business Goals
</h3>
<p>
    Business strategy defines the manner in which the organization needs to interact with its environment, so as to fulfill
    its purpose. As such, business strategy is essentially focused on the external perspective of the organization, rather
    than internally managing the organization. Business strategy and business goals are closely related: Business goals
    define what needs to be achieved to realize a higher-level goal, while business strategy provides the boundaries within
    which these goals will be defined. Strategy does not, however, prescribe specific goals.
</p>
<p>
    Strategy is about <b>positioning</b>. In business, strategy describes the desired competitive position of the
    organization. The organization can fulfill its purpose once it finds itself in a sustainable competitive position.
    Business goals describe what must be achieved to reach that desired competitive position. Both business strategy and
    business goals are concerned with <b>what</b> must be achieved and not how it will be achieved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Business goals should&nbsp;focus on what provides competitive advantage to the organization, for only this is
    strategic. We can conclude that business goals must define what must be achieved in order to reach a sustainable
    competitive position.
</p>
<p>
    <font size="4"><strong>Business Goal Hierarchy</strong></font>
</p>
<p>
    Business goals are usually high level and have a long-term focus. However, business goals need to be translated to a
    concrete, measurable level before they can be used to manage the activities of the business. Such a measurable and
    time-constrained business goal is often referred to as an objective. Business goals therefore need to be arranged in a
    hierarchy, with each business goal (or objective) traced back to the higher level goals it&nbsp;supports. Without such
    linkage, individuals and departments can optimize their local performance but not contribute to achieving strategic
    objectives.
</p>
<p>
    It is imperative to obtain clear insight into this hierarchy of business goals and how it is supported by the
    activities of the business. This allows for rapidly propagating changes in direction from the strategic level downward.
    This ability to rapidly change the direction of the entire operation is called <b>strategic agility,</b> and it allows
    the organization to react to changes faster than its competitors.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example of a business goal hierarchy in a payment services organization:
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="./../../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/bgo1.gif" width="515" height="291" />&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Figure 1.&nbsp; Sample business goal hierarchy
</p>
<p>
    The high-level business goal Customer Intimacy has been translated to business goals at a lower level, which are more
    recognizable to individual departments within the organization. By defining these more concrete business goals, the
    problem of objectively measuring customer intimacy is solved. Sometimes it is necessary to translate one or more of
    these lower goals further.
</p>
<h3>
    Business Processes and Business Goals
</h3>
<p>
    Goals are useless in themselves. They must be translated into action in order to be meaningful. Every business goal
    needs to be directly supported by at least one business process.&nbsp; If not, it needs to&nbsp;be further defined in
    terms of more concrete subgoals.
</p>
<p>
    It has always been difficult to define a business strategy and then derive objectives in support of this strategy for
    different parts of the organization. Business processes in the modern enterprise are integrated and cross-functional,
    and this actually makes the process of allocating business goals easier than before. Business goals are allocated to
    parts of the organizational in terms of these integrated business processes, which add value to stakeholders of the
    business. The contribution of one particular part of the organization to customer satisfaction, for example, can be
    defined and measured.
</p>
<h3>
    Balanced Scorecard
</h3>
<p>
    The answer to the question posed above must be sought in a method that gives the user insight into the course of action
    taken. The method must also&nbsp;indicate to the user the consequences of any action taken. One such method is the
    Balanced Scorecard (BSC) by Kaplan and Norton [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">KN96</a>]. The BSC defines a technique for translating business strategy into business
    goals and measures, thereby ensuring a balanced focus on achievement of all goals.
</p>
<p>
    Kaplan and Norton write: "Front-line employees must understand the financial consequences of their decisions and
    actions; senior executives must understand the drivers of long-term financial success. The objectives and measures of
    the Balanced Scorecard are ... derived from a top-down process driven by the mission and strategy of the business."
</p>
<p>
    The theory behind the BSC is quite logical:
</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
    <li style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in"     class="MsoNormal">
        Know where you want the organization to be in the future (desired competitive position).
    </li>
    <li style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in"     class="MsoNormal">
        Know the business and the sort of organization required to reach that position (purpose, or mission).
    </li>
    <li style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in"     class="MsoNormal">
        Define the relationship between the mission and the activities of the business (business goals).
    </li>
    <li style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in"     class="MsoNormal">
        Define more precisely what is to be achieved and when the results are to be accomplished (operational objectives).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Business goals are scored using four perspectives. It could be concluded that there are only four types of business
    goals. However the method of scoring and thus the types&nbsp;of business goals is arbitrary. An organization is free to
    define more types as they are required.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Financial Perspective</b>-Indicates what has happened in the past and measures what needs to be&nbsp;performed to
    achieve the financial objectives and check the performance.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Customer Perspective</b>-Looks at the present and indicates what needs to be accomplished to improve customer
    relationship.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Learning and Growth Perspective</b>-Looks at the future and what must be achieved to maintain growth and achieve
    further improvement.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Internal Process Perspective</b>-Looks at the present and indicates which internal processes must be performed with
    excellence for customer and shareholder satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
    An important feature of the BSC is that there needs to be a cause-and-effect relationship between all the perspectives
    and hence also between all the identified business goals. The following simple but effective example illustrates this.

</div>
<p>
    <br />
    This is an iterative process, because maintaining or improving profitability will enable the organization to keep
    employing sufficient qualified staff. As Kaplan and Norton indicate, "If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage
    it."&nbsp; It is imperative therefore that business goals can be measured objectively, either quantitatively or
    qualitatively. (See the next section.)
</p>
<h3>
    Measuring Goal Achievement
</h3>
<p>
    Just the intention to achieve goals is not enough to ensure that the business strategy will be executed. People must
    receive feedback on their actions in order to learn and improve.&nbsp; By measuring the achievement of business goals,
    business activities can be increasingly aligned with strategy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Measurements are useful for a number of reasons. First, measurements provide an indication of how successfully the
    business strategy is being implemented at various levels of the business. Second, measurements give insight into the
    effectiveness of goals. Finally, measurements provide a feedback mechanism with which minor adjustments can be made to
    the strategy based on operating conditions. This feedback can also be accumulated and aggregated over a long period
    with which the strategy can be adjusted more significantly.
</p>
<p>
    If business goals are not translated to sufficiently measurable levels within the organization, they might remain too
    abstract for employees to relate to, which will make it very unlikely that people will strive to achieve the goals in
    their daily tasks.
</p>
<p>
    The current definition of&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm_lic/workproducts/business_goals_DA209FA6.html" guid="_dVZo0ExAEeCVDLd4OF5QmQ">Artifact: Business Goal</a>&nbsp;includes the details to measure the goal in the future
    whereas a more complete model commonly used in strategy modeling is shown in Figure 2.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="./../../../core.bus.common.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/goal_kpi_metric.gif" width="220" height="236" />&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Figure 2.&nbsp; Goal-KPI-metric model
</p>
<p>
    <b>Goal or sub-goal</b>: Organizations define goals to meet their mission and to set strategic direction. In SOMA, the
    term goal denotes a business aspiration starting at a high level. For example a high level goal could be to increase
    revenue. This goal can be decomposed into sub-goals such as "increase revenue from &lt;x&gt;", and "increase revenue
    from &lt;y&gt;".
</p>
<p>
    <b>KPI's</b>: KPIs are used to determine how well a business is meeting its goals, or to assess the level of
    performance of business processes. For example, for the goal "increase revenue", a specific KPI could be "increase
    revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year". This provides a specific way to determine if the goal has been met.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Metrics:</b> Metrics identify the type of measurements that need to be collected to assess the state of the KPIs.
    For a KPI such as "increase revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year", a metric could be "record the revenue from all
    revenue generating transactions". Measurements would then need to be taken of each relevant transaction, across all
    systems that support those transactions. An implication of this is that all of the individual measurements dictated by
    the metric would need to be aggregated and reported in a meaningful way so that it can be determined if the related KPI
    has been met.
</p>
<h3>
    Resolving Goal Conflicts
</h3>
<p>
    Due to the diverse nature of business goals, they might appear to conflict with one another. A typical example is for
    call-center employees to service many customers in a specific time (throughput), yet deliver high quality of service to
    each customer (which takes time). If the call-center manager rewards the employee with the most calls, the service
    level will drop. On the other hand, if the manager rewards the employee with the most satisfied customers, the
    throughput will drop. Volume versus time or quality versus cost are recognizable goal-conflict patterns to which
    Eriksson and Penker refer. They also described a technique, using an association stereotyped
    &lt;&lt;contradictory&gt;&gt;, for explicitly modeling conflicts between business goals.
</p>
<p>
    Managers must be aware of this very common dilemma when setting business goals. However, the strategy of an
    organization does not stand or fall on any single business goal, much the same as a war is not wan or lost by a single
    battle. The direction of the organization is derived from the sum of all actions taken. It might therefore seem that a
    business goal is counter-productive, but when the goal is measured as one part of the whole, the sum is actually
    positive. This means that localized inefficiencies might actually contribute indirectly to the business strategy.
    Nonetheless, not performing a minor "course correction" (because for example, somebody is more interested in the bonus
    as a result of the performance of his or her own department) can put the organization as a whole at a disadvantage.
</p>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    An organization has a vision, which is translated into a strategy.&nbsp; The strategy&nbsp;must be met by the business
    goals that are ultimately measured in the operations of the organization. The vision is implemented by business workers
    and business actors interacting to realize the business use cases. Business goals are the "glue" between the business
    strategy and business use cases. If they are correctly defined, they will give the organization the required insight to
    keep on course or to change course as required.
</p>
<p>
    Business goals must be defined at a sufficiently high level in order to focus the entire organization on the vision.
    Objectives and measures must be defined at a sufficiently low level within an organization in order that employees can
    identify themselves with them. Business goals must be measurable to be effective, either quantitatively or by the sum
    of subgoals (qualitatively).
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of techniques for defining and measuring business goals, one of which is the Balanced Scorecard.
    Whatever technique is used, however, it needs to&nbsp;be applied as a management tool and not solely as a measurement
    instrument.
