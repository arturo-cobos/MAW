    This task is based on the WWPMM work pattern S3: Expand work plans.
</p>
<p>
    Normally, the project work plans have been developed when shaping the project, in order to prepare a proposal for
    project execution, which is now transformed into a sponsor Agreement. However, these plans were most often only
    "outlined" or developed to a level which was sufficient to prepare the Agreement, but they are not sufficiently
    detailed to control project execution. It is now time to "expand" these plans to a level of detail relevant for
    enabling work allocation and progress tracking.
</p>
<p>
    The Project Manager should finalize the project plan(s) for use in controlling the progress of the project team.
    Project Plans (regardless of project size) must be validated and finalized to expand and complete the Work Breakdown
    Structure (WBS), project effort, cost, and schedule baselines, and other project management plans so that they fully
    address the scope and requirements of the SOW.&nbsp; Any impact to the project plans should be incorporated. If
    necessary, a Project Change Request should be considered if the scope, costs or schedule are materially changed.
</p>
<p>
    The elementary work products, or components, that need to be produced and assembled into the operational work products
    and deliverables which were identified when shaping the project are fully identified, paying particular attention to
    components that are common to several work products.
</p>
<p>
    The tasks involved in producing preliminary work products, such as models and detailed specifications, or involved in
    decision making, in assembling and validating work products, or in delivering and deploying the solution, are refined
    to the level which is appropriate to confirm their estimates and the profile of the team members for undertaking them.
</p>
<p>
    As a result, the work units that were identified when shaping the project (now part of the baseline defined in the
    Agreement) are expanded into work items that are suitable for the purpose of tracking progress, and the chronology to
    produce these work items is refined.
</p>
<p>
    The work items are bundled into work packages which are assigned to individuals, the detailed effort estimates are
    adjusted to take into account the availability and capability of those individuals, and the resulting Operational
    Schedule is reconciled with the baselines of the Project Management Schedule. This reconciliation process may lead to
    adjustments in the staffing plans, and even require discussion with the project sponsor about scope and timeframe
    revisions.
</p>
<p>
    Review the high level Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that were produced when
    shaping the project and identify any change that may have been introduced in the final Agreement, and then refine the
    breakdown of the high level PBS and WBS until it is possible to identify work items that constitute a sound basis for
    confirming the estimates. Then, using a bottom-up technique, refine the profile of the team members for producing the
    work items.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the size of the work items that are considered here, and the metrics used to estimate them, should be
    relevant for both estimating and tracking purposes. Supplement, as necessary, the Work Product List to make sure each
    work product that is a final outcome for an activity is included.
</p>
<p>
    Also note that the technical work patterns that were used when performing the method adoption workshop (MAW) during
    project shaping activities should be looked at again, and will likely help identifying a number of these work items.

<p>
    Note that when the project organization is made of several project organizational units (POUs), the activities
    described above would be performed by each POU, and be reconciled, across all levels of the project Organizational
    Breakdown Structure (OBS) to ensure a global consistency.
</p>
<p>
    The key outputs of this task are the Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) of the operational work products, Work Breakdown
    Structure (WBS), the expanded Work Product List, Project Management Schedule and Operational Schedules, and the
    financial measurement baseline (part of Financial Plan which may be part of the Project Management System
    Summary).&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; All plans in the GBS PM Minimal (WWPMM) delivery process are documented within the Project
    Management System Summary (PMSS).
