    Integration Contracts represents a specification independent of concrete implementation, consistent with the Interface
    design pattern, and when defined represent the list of operation signatures that the Integration Mediator Function will
    need to request.&nbsp; Defining the Integration Contract as a specification is critical to afford the caller the
    flexibility to implement according to its architectural needs.&nbsp; When implemented, the Integration Contract
    represents an independent object that encapsulates the answers to these requests and is passed to the Integration
    Mediator Function by the caller.
</p>
<p>
    Defining the Integration Mediator Function to reference an Integration Contracts, a specification rather than a
    concrete implementation, enables the Integration Mediator Function to service any number of requestors without becoming
    coupled to them or having to change to support them.&nbsp; It also provides the requestors flexibility in the way they
    architect the concrete implementations of the Integration Contract to support their unique architectural needs.&nbsp;
    This allows the Integration Mediator Function to serve SOA consumers in the same manner it serves Java application
    clients.

    Integration Mediators encapsulate the business domain from the knowledge of the enterprise integration process being
    used for data storage and retrieval.&nbsp; The Integration Mediator is responsible for making Data Objects that are not
    related work together to provide a complete Integration Mediator.&nbsp; By encapsulating this logic from the domain,
    the integration technologies and the physical transactions can change with reduced impact to the requestor.&nbsp;
    Additionally, other domains can leverage the Integration Mediator Functions to gain access to the SOA services,
    operational systems and data store(s) it encapsulates.
</p>
<p>
    The Integration Mediator should be written in such a way to provide the data needs for a business process, so that the
    requestor doesn’t know the number of data sources and enterprise applications that are being touched to manage the data
    for that business process.&nbsp;

    The primary responsibility of the Integration Mediator Function is to manage the logical unit of work that spans the
    physical transactions of the disparate back-end systems and provides roll-back services in the event that one of those
    physical transactions fail.&nbsp; The logical unit(s) of work and all physical transactions must be started, executed,
    exceptions handled including rollback, and the unit of work closed within the process of the Integration Mediator
    Function.
</p>
<p>
    Each Integration Mediator Function must take an Integration Contract as its’ only parameter.&nbsp; Requestors will only
    be able to access Integration Mediator Functions by providing the appropriate Integration Contract.&nbsp; The
    Integration Mediator Function will query the provided Integration Contract for information it needs to complete the
    requested operation, and will not forward the contract to objects out of the Integration Mediator layer.&nbsp; The
    Integration Mediator Function may use Data Objects and other Integration Mediator Functions to deliver its’
    operation.&nbsp; The Integration Mediator Function is responsible for knowing the functions that need to be called and
    the order in which they must be called.&nbsp; If a Data Object’s function needs to be called and parameters passed, the
    Integration Mediator Function is responsible for either passing information it has gathered from services it has
    triggered or requesting information from the instance of the Integration Contract that was passed to it.&nbsp; If
    another Integration Mediator Function is to be called, the calling Integration Mediator Function is responsible for
    instantiating the appropriate Integration Contract and populating the contract with the information it has from
    processes it has performed or from the Integration Contract that was passed to it.&nbsp; A Integration Mediator
    Function must return one of the following to its’ users:&nbsp; void, a Integration Exception, an Immutable Data Object
    Interface, or a collection of the same type of Immutable Data Object Interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    The Integration Mediator Function is responsible for handling all exceptions that are returned from Data Objects and
    other Integration Mediator Functions it leverages to deliver its’ process.&nbsp; In the case that a recovery
    alternative does not exist for the caught exceptions, the Integration Mediator Function is responsible for delivering
    the technology and product (e.g., data source, middleware, and enterprise application) independent exceptions to the
    caller that triggered it.

    1. Mapping the data contained in its attributes to the format required by the integrated APIs.<br />
    2. Mapping the response data back to its’ attributes and aggregate Data Objects.<br />
    3. In the case that multiple operational systems, middleware components, databases are required to retrieve or persist
    data for a Data Object, the Data Object is responsible for managing the logical unit of work for its data integration
    within its’ operation execution.

<p>
    Each Data Object must have and implement an Immutable Data Object Interface.&nbsp; Aggregate whole Data Objects should
    hold onto their aggregate part Data Object references as the parts Immutable Data Object Interface.&nbsp; Aggregate

    The Immutable Data Object Interface is a immutable specification for a Data Object independent of concrete
    implementation, consistent with the Interface design pattern, and when defined represent the list of inquiry operation
    that the Data Object will provide.&nbsp; The Immutable Data Object Interface has two primary responsibilities:
</p>
<p>
    1. provide access to inquire (e.g., getter access) but not change (e.g., no setter access) the public internal state of
    a Data Object domain<br />
    2. decouple the layers of the architecture from a Data Model object’s specifics
</p>
<p>
    The Immutable Data Object Interface represents the list of method signatures that a requestor can access in order to
    receive information about the public state of a Data Object without becoming coupled to the Integration Data model.

    which if centralized would greatly streamline the code base, as well as ensure consistency.&nbsp; From an SOA solution
    stack perspective, the Integration Adapter is responsible for managing the communication with the Operational Systems
    layer, Integration layer, and Data Architecture layer.&nbsp; The Integration Adapter is responsible for:
</p>
<p>
    1. Open the communication channel and connect to the back-end applications.<br />
    2. Managing the physical transaction (Open, execute, handle exceptions including rollback, and close) within it’s
