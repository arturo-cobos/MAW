    The primary user of the Business Contract is the Business Mediator Function.&nbsp; It is defined to capture the
    information requests needed by the Business Mediator Function to fulfill its function.&nbsp; Business Contracts
    represents a specification independent of concrete implementation, consistent with the Interface design pattern, and
    when defined represent the list of operation signatures that the Business Mediator Function will need to request.&nbsp;
    Defining the Business Contract as a specification is critical to afford the Provider Router the flexibility to
    implement according to its architectural needs.&nbsp; When implemented, the Business Contract represents an independent
    object that encapsulates the answers to these requests and is passed to the Business Mediator Function by the Provider
    Router.
</p>
<p>
    Referencing a Business Contracts, a specification, by the Business Mediator Function, rather than a concrete
    implementation enables the Business Mediator Function to service any number of requestors without becoming coupled to
    them or having to change to support them.&nbsp; This allows the Business Mediator Function to serve SOA consumers in
    the same manner it serves Java application clients.<br />

    The Mutable Interface is a specification for a Business Object independent of concrete implementation, consistent with
    the Interface design pattern, and when defined represent the list of operation signatures that the Business Object will
    provide.&nbsp; The Mutable Interface has two primary responsibilities:
</p>
<p>
    1. Provide access to inquiry and modify the state of a Business Object<br />
    2. Decouple the layers of the architecture from the Business Object’s concrete implementation
</p>
<p>
    The only users of the Mutable Interface are:&nbsp; Business Mediator/Business Mediator Functions and Business Objects.
    The Mutable Interface defines a view on the Business Model (Model) that the Business Mediator/Business Mediator
    Function (Controller) uses to modify the state of the Business Model. The Business Objects use the Mutable Interfaces
    to decouple themselves from the specific implementations of other Business Objects in the model.&nbsp; The aggregate
    whole Business Object will hold reference to and modify the state of its aggregate part Business Objects through the
    Mutable Interface, rather than directly through the Business Object.<br />

<td><p>
    The Immutable Interface is a specification which limits the user to operations to inquire about the state of a Business
    Object, but not change the state.&nbsp; As a specification, the Immutable Interface is independent of concrete
    implementation, consistent with the Interface design pattern, and when defined represent the list of operation
    signatures to inquire the state of the Business Object.&nbsp; When compared to the Mutable Interface, the Immutable
    Interface reduces the visibility to inquiry only operations, which allows this component to be returned to Views (as
    defined in Model View Controller terminology) and ensure compliance with the MVC framework.
</p>
<p>
    The Immutable Interface has two primary responsibilities:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    1. provide access to inquire (e.g., getter access) but not change (e.g., no setter access) the public internal state of
    a Business Model object<br />
    2. decouple the layers of the architecture from a Business Model object’s specifics
</p>
<p>
    The Immutable Interface represents the list of method signatures that the user can request in order to receive
    information about the public state of a Business Object without becoming coupled to the domain. Immutable Interfaces
    are implementations of the Interface design pattern and when defined represent the method signatures for the requests
    without their concrete implementations.
</p>
<p>
    The primary user of the Immutable Interface is the Provider Router component.&nbsp; The Immutable Interface defines a
    view on the Domain Model (Model) that can be returned by the Business Mediator Functions(Controller) to the Provider
    Router (View) to preserve the integrity of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Other users of the Immutable Interface include:&nbsp; Business Contracts, Business Mediator/Business Mediator
    Functions, Business Objects, and Integration Contracts.&nbsp; All of these objects should make inquiry requests to the
    Immutable Interface of a Business Object, rather than talk directly to the Business Object<br />

    The Business Mediator is the “brains of the operation”.&nbsp; A Business Mediator encapsulates the business process
    logic and rules of the Functional Component processes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Business Mediator is responsible for making
    Business Objects, that are not (coupled) related, work together to provide a complete logical unit of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    To accomplish this, the Business Mediator works with the Business Model; however, we do not want the Business Mediator
    to become tied directly to the concrete Business Model, so we have the Business Mediator Functions interact with the
    Mutable Interface of the Business Model objects.&nbsp;

    Business Mediator Function on a Business Mediator&nbsp; (i.e. each operation&nbsp; on the Business Mediator) must take
    a Business Contract as a parameter.&nbsp; Provider Routers will only be able to access Business Mediator Functions by
    providing an implementation of the appropriate Business Contract.&nbsp; The Business Mediator Function will query the
    provided Business Contract for information it needs to complete the requested service, and will not forward the
    contract to objects out of the Business Controller Layer.&nbsp; The Business Mediator Function integrates Mutable
    Interfaces and other Business Mediator Functions to deliver its’ business process.&nbsp; The Business Mediator Function
    is responsible for knowing the functions that need to be called and the order in which they must be called.&nbsp; If a
    Mutable Interface function needs to be called and parameters passed, the Business Mediator Function is responsible for
    either passing information it has gathered from services it has triggered or requesting information from its’ Business
    Contract.&nbsp; If another Business Mediator Function is to be called, the calling Business Mediator Function is
    responsible for instantiating the appropriate Business Contract implementation and populating the contract with the
    information it has from work it has performed or from its’ Business Contract.
</p>
<p>
    The Business Mediator Function is responsible for handling all exceptions that are returned from Mutable Interfaces,
    The Contract Validator, and other Business Mediator Functions it leverages to deliver its’ business process.&nbsp; In
    the case that a recovery alternative does not exist for the exceptions, the Business Mediator Function is responsible
    for delivering business exceptions to the Provider Router that triggered it.
</p>
<p>
    In order to eliminate data compatibility exceptions that may arise as a result of inappropriate input data, the
    Business Mediator Function may choose to leverage a Contract Validator to confirm the state of the Business Contract
    implementation’s data prior to using the data in it’s processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The Business Mediator Function rules focus on the business logic that pertains to the process and the interoperation of
    the unrelated Business Objects.&nbsp; Any logic that is specific to a particular Business Object only should not be
    moved to the Business Mediator Function domain.
</p>
<p>
    A Business Mediator Function encompasses a complex business process, can integrate other Business Mediator Functions
    and Business Object operations in delivering its’ process, maintains its own internal state during the process, and
    manages a logical unit of work which once completed must terminate.

    contract must adhere to this validation or an exception will be raised. The Contract Validator is invoked by the
    Mediator Function, when needed/desired.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the validation is to confirm that the minimum input data has been provided.&nbsp; The Contract Validator
    should not become a single source for all rules validation.&nbsp; Process oriented rules should remain in the Mediator
    Function, while rules internal to the Domain Object should remain within the Domain Object.

<td>The Domain Factory is in place to provide complete encapsulation of the Process Mediator/Mediator Functions from knowledge

pattern, which is used by the Mediator Functions to request new instances of the Domain Objects.&nbsp; The Domain Factory
is responsible for providing the requestor with an instance of the Domain Object, but preventing the requestor from
directly accessing the instance of the Domain Object by returning only access to the Controller View.&nbsp; By providing
only access to the Controller View, the Mediator Function will remain independent of the implementation of the Domain
Object, which will allow greater flexibility for the Domain Object to change without change to the Mediator Function.&nbsp;
Only in the event that the public interface of the Controller View changes might the Mediator Function be affected.</td>
