<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    It is not uncommon that a client engagement has a number of phases and sometimes, several Statement of Works (SOWs) or
    Project Change Requests (PCRs). A lot can happen from one PCR to the next; the client’s management can change; they may
    react to a threat or market opportunity; they may re-prioritize their objectives and in all these cases, funding may be
    compromised or want to be redirected.
</p>
<p>
    To be dedicated to every client’s success, means in this context, to be sure we are building the right service
    portfolio for the client; that has the highest relevance to what they do, what their objectives are, and what they
    aspire to achieve. Therefore, we need to periodically pause and review the service model as it stands: infant or mature
    and validate its relevance from a client’s perspective.This process is called rationalizing the service model (or
    portfolio). This review can lead to changes (called refactoring) in the service model due to a re-prioritization. Some
    services will become more important; others will sink in priority. At any event, refactoring of this service model may
    be required. Thus we have the Service Re-factoring and Rationalization (SRR) capability pattern. In Service
    Re-factoring and Rationalization, we review the service model, re-factor and refine the service portfolio and service
    hierarchy, make exposure decisions, and finally rationalize the service model and its constituent parts based on the
    re-factoring and exposure decisions. In this capability pattern, we leverage another technique that is called the
    Service Litmus Test (SLT). This test or series of criteria are customized for relevance to the client. Services are
    tested against these criteria. The result is a re-factored service model.
</p>
<p>
    This Service Refactoring and Rationalization is executed opportunistically in SOMA life cycle and at the beginning and
    end of every phase. In SOMA, we progressively elaborate the service model and gain more insight about the services both
    in terms of functional and qualitative aspects. The additional elaboration specified and insight gained in the SOMA
    life cycle since previous execution of the capability pattern is considered as input during re-factoring and
    rationalization.<br />
    <br />
    Having eliminated duplicate services during the rationalization and refactoring we are in a better position to conduct
    SLTs as we have already eliminated some redundancy.
</p>
<p>
    In SOMA, complimentary techniques are applied to identify candidate services and these complimentary techniques may
    result in duplicate services thereby confirming the need and value of the service.<br />
    <br />
    In addition, overlapping or duplicate services are added in the service model in a typical engagement when multiple
    teams are working on service identification and each team is focusing on a technique or specific areas of concern
    within a technique. Teams may be unaware of the services identified by others.<br />
    <br />
    For example, when project scope includes multiple business process groups to analyze, typically a team of 1-2 business
    analyst and architect work on Process Modeling and Decomposition focusing on a process group. This capability pattern
    allows us to confirm the need and vale of a given service and to eliminate duplication and overlap in the service model
    by re-factoring and refining it.<br />
    <br />
    All the services that are identified in SOMA are initially designated are “candidate services” representing a business
    aligned capability and decisions on building, deploying and publishing (aka exposing) the services are postponed till
    the execution of SRR. Although, in theory, any candidate service could be built, deployed, and published (aka exposed)
    by exporting its interface as a service description but it may not be economical and practical (non-functional
    requirements may be compromised) feasible to do so. In particular, the native decision to expose “all methods from all
    classes” will result in an overwhelming and often unmanageable number of services leading to the “Service Proliferation
    Syndrome”. Reviewing and ensuring the service granularity is essential to control this proliferation syndrome.<br />
    <br />
    Moreover, exposing all candidate services will be a daunting financial commitment for an enterprise because building
    and managing the service life cycle includes additional cost and resources over and above just building the business
    functionality encapsulated by the candidate service. Additionally, there is cost associated with every service in terms
    of its governance and underlying infrastructure (its security, performance, maintenance, monitoring & management,
    other SLAs). In SOMA, a set of gating criteria is introduced to select the service for exposure meaning for building,
    deploying, and publishing for discovery by consumers.<br />
    <br />
</p>
<h4>
    Service Granularity
</h4>
<p>
    Service granularity is essential characteristics of the Service Model. Services that are identified during
    Identification represent business capabilities and placed in a service hierarchy in the Service Model if functional
    areas are known and Service Hierarchy is already defined. If service hierarchy is not defined during the time of
    identification of the services, then the services are placed in service hierarchy later when Functional Area Analysis
    is conducted and functional areas are identified. Service Hierarchy in a Service Model represents service granularity.
    As you we go deeper in the hierarchy, granularity of the services is finer grained. The hierarchical Service Model
    provides a business oriented perspective of SOA representing a list of business capabilities organized and categorized
    in a hierarchy and relationship among these business capabilities in the hierarchy. Service granularity helps in
    transforming identification level Service Model representing business oriented perspective on SOA to specification
    level Service Model representing IT concerns.
</p><br />
<h4>
    Service Litmus Test (SLT)
</h4>
<p>
    The set of gating criteria to select and filter a set of (candidate) services from the service portfolio for exposure
    is called Service Litmus Tests. These Service Litmus Tests help decide whether to expose a service and most
    importantly, whether to fund the creation of the service component that will provide the functionality of the service
    as well as the maintenance, monitoring, security, performance and other service level agreements of the service. This
    decision making process is referred to as the “Service Exposure Decisions”.<br />
    <br />
    On the one extreme, every business use case might be considered to be a candidate service. On the other, only a few
    services are selected for exposure. Applying the SLT usually gives something in the middle: a manageable set of
    services that the business wants to expose and that can later be used within compositions. The Service Litmus Test
    metaphor is used to denote a set of tests, that when applied, will determine if a given service should be eligible for
    exposure using a service description. These tests are employed together and help answer questions such as – “From the
    list of candidate services, which ones should be exposed? And thus, which ones should we fund? Which ones have business
    value?”<br />
    <br />
    We apply these tests at the beginning and end of every phase and opportunistically in SOMA to the list of candidate
    services to rationalize on which of the candidate service may be exposed as services. These tests are applied first
    time at the end of SOMA Identification phase. While doing so, being very early on in the SOMA life cycle there are
    going to be certain litmus tests that may not be possible to be applied to the candidate services owing to the
    non-availability of information that is commensurate with the requirements of the test. However, as and when we go
    through the phases in SOMA life cycle we should expect to readdress the service litmus tests with the assumption that
    more information is available in subsequent phases to execute more aspects of the litmus test. The additive
    understanding of services that needs to be exposed will change as and when we get more information.
</p>
<p>
    There are currently six universal Service Litmus Tests which collectively form the “gating criteria” for service
    exposure.<br />
    1. Business Alignment<br />
    2. Composability<br />
    3. Externalized Service Description<br />
    4. Redundancy Elimination/Reusability<br />
    5. Technical Feasibility<br />
    6. Business Entity based Information Services<br />
    <br />
    <em><strong>SOMA Tip:</strong> In addition to this universal SLT, we may define project or client specific SLT for an
    engagement to support the needs of the project or client.</em><br />
    <br />
    Each of Service Litmus Tests has set of questions which help decide whether a service passes the SLT. A negative
    response to any of the questions under a SLT results in a candidate service failing the SLT. A candidate service must
    pass all the universal and project or client specific SLT to be exposed. In certain cases, the client may override the
    exposure decision made systematically by applying the SLT. In cases where client override the exposure decision we must
    document the reason for the override by the client.<br />
    <br />
    <em><strong>SOMA Tip:</strong> Candidate services that do not meet the SLT and hence are no exposed will still have to
    be implemented in some fashion as they are often required to fulfill business needs. They may be implemented as methods
    on service components and will not require the generation of WSDL or other forms of service definitions; or they may be
    used as non-exposable entities.</em>
</p>
<h4>
    Service Exposure Assessment Toolkit (SEAT)
</h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Based on field experience, simple yes/no answer to SLT questions not always sufficient to make exposure decision. In
    SOMA 3.2, we have devised a <strong><em>Service Exposure Assessment Toolkit (SEAT).</em></strong> This tool kit has key
    three main components<br />
    <br />
    <strong>SLT Rating (SLTR)</strong> – The SLT Rating is the relative importance/priority that client/organization
    assigns to a SLT. It indicates how important a given SLT is for the client. It is a relative ranking of SLTs; one SLT
    is more important than the other. The recommended values for this rating are 1-5 where 1 = low priority, 3 = medium
    priority, 5 = high priority.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Scoring Table</strong> – Field experience shows that simply answering yes or not to a SLT question is not
    workable and that we need a scale to answer these questions. In SOMA 3.2, we have defined a scoring mechanism for
    answers to the questions similar to Analytic Rubrics used for making assessments in the industry. We have defined when
    to score 0 – 5 in the Scoring Table for each of the questions for the SLTs. The Scoring Table provides guidance how to
    answer the questions in a scale of 0-5 and can be adapted to meet client’s need.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Service Rating (SR)</strong> – The Service Rating is the assessed applicability of the given SLT to a service.
    It indicates how to assess a service as satisfying the SLT. It is determined based on the answers and scoring given
    against the recommended values are 0-5; 0 = no applicability, 1 = low applicability, 3 = medium applicability, 5 = high
    applicability. It is calculated by taking average of the scores for each of the questions.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Weighted Service Rating (WSR)</strong> – Weighted Service Rating is service rating weighted by SLT priority as
    captured by SLT Rating (SLTR).<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Total Weighted Service Rating (TWSR)</strong> - Total Weighted Service Rating of a service is the sum of
    Weighted Service Rating for all the SLTs.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Service Rating Threshold</strong> – It is threshold used to filter services for exposure based on Total
    Weighted Service Rating of the services. Any services having TWSR greater than the threshold are exposed. Best
    practices on how determine the threshold using medians and standard deviation is documented later in this document.
</p><br />
<h4>
    Service Exposure Scope
</h4>
<p>
    Designation of service exposure is not adequate to specify who can use the service. In addition to service exposure
    decision, we need to specify at what level of scope the service is being designed to be exposed. Service exposure scope
    identifies the scope of the exposure for the (exposed) services. The exposure scope affects the non-functional
    requirements e.g. security requirement of the services. The exposure scopes that are predefined in the method are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Division/Department: Services that are exposed to only a division or a department of an enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>
        Line of Business: Services that are exposed to a line of business of an enterprise
    </li>
    <li>
        Enterprise: Services that are exposed to enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ecosystem: Services that are exposed to entire ecosystem including enterprises and their trading partners.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
</ol></td>
