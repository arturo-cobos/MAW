    This task is being performed to identify the principal information entities, which we are calling as Business Entities.
    These Business Entities provides a business-users view of the process information. Identifying them provides a two-fold
    advantage – (a) business users are quite familiar with these Business Entities and are able to articulate their
    business operations in terms of the BE lifecycle and content and (b) the Business Entity perspective brings information
    as a first class notion into process design.

    Business entities are the information structures that in essence are the key drivers to the functional area in which
    business process modeling is being performed. In most cases, these business entities are quite evident eg. the 'Claim'
    in an Insurance Claim Process, the 'Trouble Ticket' in a Telecom Service Assurance Process, the 'Service Order' in a
    Service Delivery Management process etc.
</p>
<p>
    If Functional Area Analysis has been conducted then we have already established the 'scope' in which the business
    entities will be identified eg. 'Customer Service Account Opening Business Process'.
</p>
<p>
    Goal Service Modeling on the other hand provides the focus. Typically a business goal or objective can be directly
    correlated to a set of metrics around one or more key business entities eg. 'cost reduction of Account Application
    process'.
</p>
<p>
    Some useful characteristics to keep in mind when identifying business entities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Familiar: business people should not have difficulty recognizing business entities (should make 'business sense';
        not necessarily a data model)
    </li>
    <li>
        Should have a lifecycle: The lifecycle models are specified using finite state machines, where each state of the
        machine corresponds intuitively to a business-relevant milestone, or operational objective, that might be achieved
        by a Business Entity instance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Relationship to Goal: should be clear as to which goal is being tracked
    </li>
    <li>
        Owned and controlled by the business: a business does not send its business entities outside its boundaries
    </li>
    <li>
        Means for coordination of goals: in most businesses progress towards related goals need to be coordinated
    </li>
    <li>
        Identity: uniquely identifiable
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    'Document' is an accurate metaphor for business entity. Thus a business 'form' or 'document' used in the process are
    potential BE candidates. For example, the 'Guest Check' is a key business entity to model the business operations of a
    restaurant.
</p>
<p>
    Next partition the conceptual data model 'rooted' around the key business entities. This is a logical partitioning to
    group the non-key business entities (also known as contextual data items) around the key ones. Typically, these
    contextual data items are information that gets added or referenced by the key business entities though its life.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Finding a family of useful BE types for a given scope of an enterprise typically requires a taking a fresh look at the
    enterprise. It is important to clear one’s mind and ask questions about the fundamental objectives of the enterprise
    and the high-level activities used to achieve them. It is essential to avoid getting distracted by the current modus
    operandi, which in most cases evolved from a largely process-centric perspective, and may also be deeply siloed.
</p>
<p>
    When searching for the key BE type or types within a scope, it is useful to focus on the following kinds of questions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <em>What is your business producing?</em> Enterprises are typically set up to perform certain activities, or
        produce certain goods, in a repeatable manner. The repetitions typically correspond to BE instances and the classes
        of similar activities or goods typically correspond to BE types. Each time the activity is performed or the good
        produced, this corresponds to one instance of a conceptual entity that evolves as it passes through the business.
        In many cases, a BE type will have a lifecycle that has a definitive end (for example, servicing an insurance claim
        ends with a settlement payment or a denial), while others may have a very long life (for example, customer history
        in a loyalty program). In some cases, one BE type might have multiple children of another BE type (for example, an
        academic conference might have numerous submissions, or there might be BE types for both conference and submission;
        a customer loyalty program typically has reward redemptions, and so there might be BE types for both customer
        history and redemption). There can be other patterns of the relationship between BE types. In an e-commerce
        scenario, for example, one might focus on order and shipment as two main BE types, where a single order might be
        broken into multiple shipments. If parts of two orders might be combined into a single shipment, then it may be
        useful to consider line item as a BE type along with both order and shipment. In most cases, there are between one
        and five BE types in a typical department or division of a larger enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>What are the key goals, and how do you measure them?</em> Often, the goals, including key performance
        indicators (KPIs), are closely correlated with the over-arching BE types of an enterprise. These goals and KPIs are
        often conceived by a team of business leaders, who are not thinking about, or even aware of, the details of how
        processes are being implemented. The kinds of data collected for the KPIs often suggest important attributes of the
        BE type information models.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>How do you measure progress towards the goals?</em> Are there key sub-goals? Often the steps or sub-goals that
        are monitored during the progression towards a goal correspond the business-relevant milestones, for example,
        states in the BE type lifecycle state machine. If there are different ways to achieve a major goal, these may
        correspond to different possible paths in the state machine.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Are there different stages of your activity that work on the same underlying entity, even if different
        documents are used to describe it, or different parts of your enterprise are performing the work?</em> One of the
        more subtle challenges in identifying BE types is deciding what should be grouped into a single BE type vs.
        separated into two or more BE types. As a general rule of thumb, it is helpful to make each BE type span as far as
        possible across an enterprise, even if it cuts across several divisions or silos. In this way, you enable a focus
        on conceptual entities that retain their identity as they progress through the enterprise. For example, consider
        the process of making a loan and tracking the repayments over time. In some cases it will be useful to combine
        these two aspects into a single BE type. This facilitates communication between the loan creators and the loan
        trackers, reducing hand-off problems between these two sides of the overall business. In other cases it might be
        useful to separate these into two BE types, for example, if the loans might be bundled together after creation.
        Often, it is the possibility of one-to-many or many-to-many relationships that leads to breaking related notions
        into two or more BE types.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Philosophically there are two approaches to finding Business Entities – the concrete and the conceptual. In the
    concrete approach, the existing data domain is analyzed to come up with the logical view of the BE types. This can be
    equated to traditional data modeling, in which disparate information sources (databases, applications, content, and so
    on) are analyzed and the logical view created to capture the key structures (data and metadata) and their
    relationships. Unlike traditional data modeling, however, here one is most interested in finding BE types whose
    instances follow a somewhat predictable lifecycle as they flow through the business. In doing so, one could identify
    the BE (the key data structures of importance) and its child data used by the BE instance during its lifetime. Thus in
    the concrete view, the BE actually has an existing physical representation.
</p>
<p>
    The conceptual approach begins with talking to the business SMEs to understand in a top-down way what the key dynamic
    conceptual business-relevant entities that underlie their operations are. These are typically already manifested in a
    fragmented manner in the existing IT systems. For example, in a typical restaurant, the concept of Guest Check can
    serve as a key BE type. This is because a Guest Check typically records all the necessary information about restaurant
    operations, from customer ordering, to the kitchen preparing meals, to payment, to accounting. However, its IT
    representation is likely fragmented into finer data structures like an Order, Kitchen Order, Payment, and so on. In
    this case, the Guest Check BE type is a discovered conceptual entity that aggregates all necessary information in its
    lifecycle. By following the Guest Check the restaurant has end-to-end visibility of its operations. So Guest Check is
    identified as a BE type and gets formally added to the logical view of the data model as a container for other data
    structures (the children).<br />
