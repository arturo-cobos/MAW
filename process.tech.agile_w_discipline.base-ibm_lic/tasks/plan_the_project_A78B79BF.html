    On Agile With Discipline projects, the project is planned at two levels:
</p>
<p>
    Level one project planning
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Is first conducted at the end of the open phase, before starting the solution definition iteration (during an IBM /
        Client sales cycle or as part of the clientâ€™s governance process) to the level required to acquire and assign key
        staff to facilitate and conduct the definition iteration. If enough information is provided, or some level of
        assumptions can be made, multiple development iterations can also be estimated by creating an agile tops-down
        estimate, which involves estimating the development staff that will be needed for n iterations of a fixed
        time.&nbsp;The leads estimate how much scope can be completed in each iteration to set a range of estimate about
        how much scope can be completed in each iteration, so that some level of expectation can be set with the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        Is conducted throughout the solution definition iteration, as the requirements, architecture and planning elements
        are elaborated on. This allows the team to set stakeholder expectations (Time, Cost, and Scope), develop teaming
        scenarios to meet the business needs, and then gain commitment for multiple development iterations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Includes the initial allocation of functionality to iterations when there is enough information available, or
        reasonable assumptions can be made.&nbsp;For instance, how many iterations, how much functionality is allocated to
        each and how many (parallel?) teams are needed based on the estimated amount of work.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Level two project planning:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Is conducted at the start of each iteration and considers reflections from the past iteration (definition or
        development). These details are addressed in the iterative development practice and tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate the functionality allocated to the iteration.&nbsp; Refer to "Define and estimate the iterations and
        scenarios " in steps section.

    Responses may include avoiding or mitigating risks, exploring opportunities, or increasing the probability and positive

    responses will be prioritized and handled by the team along with other project work. Because it is not feasible to plan
    responses for all identified risks, the team may decide to accept some of them.

    three to five weeks is a good starting range. Then, at that point, for a larger initiative, based on business
    priorities, a second iteration of definition work can begin, in parallel with the first iteration of development.

    </li>
    <li>
        Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) â€“ This is a hierarchical decomposition of the phases, activities and tasks that the
        AWD Team must complete, and aligns with the standard AWD process or is copied from another like-project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Shows timeboxed iterations and key milestones that are key to the project team including any demands on external
        teams that are not part of the core agile team.

<td><p>
    Develop iteration goals, completion criteria and a timebox end date, and document them in the accelerator plan.
</p>
<p>
    Based on the priorities, and estimates developed during Story Driven Development activities, use the iteration column
    of the AWD Accelerator Plan to group prioritized-requirements into iterations that align to the iteration goals, or if
    there is not a theme that is aligned with each iteration, break them into equal-sized iterations of two to six weeks (a
    guideline of four week iteration time boxes is recommended for new applications).
</p>
<p>
    The team forecasts the number of iterations required to complete the project, using the known or anticipated velocity
    of the team to estimate roughly how much work can be done in the given time-frame. Based on the constraints of time
    (key business milestones), cost (resources) and scope (prioritized requirements), the team can develop scenarios of how
    the stories iterations can be decomposed into multiple parallel agile teams to deliver more scope in a shorter period
    of time. Additional resources may be needed to provide guidance and integrate the efforts of the two or more agile
    teams.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever possible, the team should consider deploying small releases (release cycles of three to four months at most).
    Releasing software into production frequently is a good way to get early feedback from the users, in order to enhance
    the overall product quality. Frequent releases may cause more churn in the application than some stakeholders may want,
    so the main driver should be to release based on key business value milestones, which are specific to each project.

    The end-to-end integrated iteration plans become the release plan.

constraints of the project, and to help stakeholders decide whether it is worth moving forward with the project or not. If
necessary, propose options to decrease costs, such as removing low-value and high-cost work items from the scope. Some
stakeholders may be willing to be more flexible than others, but the key argument to make is it is better to quickly arrive
at a ballpark number, begin work, then validate those assumptions through execution.</td>

    <li>
        When there are multiple teams and multiple iterations, consider the dependencies among components, data, or
        requirements which impact the ability to schedule parallel work among teams.&nbsp;When dependencies exist, the
        Agile team needs to analyze different scenarios (e.g., specialized teams, re-allocate functionality) to determine
        the best staggered delivery model to minimize the impact of the dependencies and integration effort between
        teams.&nbsp;The idea is to empower each team and minimize cross-team communication links while assuring
        communication occurs.&nbsp;Multiple streams of agile teams require a small, dedicated team of specialists to manage
        cross-team communication, integration and standards.
