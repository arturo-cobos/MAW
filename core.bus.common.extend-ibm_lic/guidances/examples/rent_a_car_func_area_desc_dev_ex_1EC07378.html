    An example based on a real customer situation can be used to illustrate the creation of an instance of a Functional
    Areas Description work product.
</p>
<p>
    The customer is a major car rental company, called “Rent-a-car” in this paper. The example scenario covers three
    business processes: Reservation, Check-in Vehicle, and Check-out Vehicle.<br />
    <br />
    This example happens to use CBM as its source of input. Although Functional Area Analysis does not require CBM as the
    source of inputs, the componentized and service oriented view that CBM takes makes it a natural fit. Remember that if
    CBM artifacts are not available, look for input from equivalent information in other artifacts that capture the results
    of a business analysis activity (refer to the Advice and Guidance section for more information). This example assumes
    that a CBM component map with descriptions of competencies and business components is available as input to the
    creation of an instance of the Functional Areas work product.<br />

    Hot Components in the Rent-a-car CBM Heat Map indicate competencies that will be the focus of Functional Area
    Analysis.shows four “hot” components – the key components for the current SOA initiative:<br />
    <br />
    · Customer Service<br />
    <br />
    · Promotions Management<br />
    <br />
    · Rentals & Reservations<br />
    <br />
    · Fleet Management.<br />
    <br />
    The CBM competencies associated with these components become the focus area domains for Functional Area Analysis
    (Figure 2). The competencies are:<br />
    <br />
    · Marketing and Customer Management (Customer Service is a hot component)<br />
    <br />
    · Products (Promotions Management is a hot component)<br />
    <br />
    · Rentals Management (Rentals and Reservations is a hot component)<br />
    <br />
    · Rental Fleet Logistics (Fleet Management is a hot component).<br />

<p>
    CBM provides a description for each component. Component descriptions provide insight into the functional
    responsibilities of domain focus areas and facilitate decomposition of domains into functional areas. As is often the
    case, CBM components map well to the functional areas that need to be identified.<br />
    <br />
    <strong><font size="3">Decomposing Business Domains into functional areas<br />
    </font></strong><br />
    Each domain is analyzed to identify the major functions it is responsible for. Each major area of functional
    responsibility that is relevant to the SOA initiative is identified as a functional area. Analysis results can be
    captured in a domain decomposition diagram that groups functional areas by domain (Figure 3) and a functional Area
    Description table (see Rent-a-car Functional Area Description Table example).<br />
    <br />
    Based on analysis of input provided by a previous CBM engagement, the following business domains have been identified
    as within scope for analysis for the Rent-a-car project:<br />
    <br />
    · Marketing and Customer Management Domain<br />
    <br />
    · Products Domain<br />
    <br />
    · Rental Fleet Logistics Domain<br />
    <br />
    · Rentals Management Domain<br />
    <br />
    Initial analysis of these business domains has identified the functional areas shown in Figure 7 as falling within the
    scope of this project.<br />

    Figure&nbsp;3: <i>Rent-a-car</i>&nbsp; Domain Decomposition Diagram</a>
</p><br />
Functional areas and functions are described in the Rent-a-car Functional Area Descriptions table example.<br />
<br />
<strong><font size="3">Rationale for choosing these domains and functional areas</font></strong><br />
<br />
CBM competencies are equivalent to business domains for the purposes of Functional Area Analysis. Hot Components in the CBM
Heat Map indicate competencies (business domains) that will be the focus for this project. The CBM competencies are: <br />
<br />
· Marketing and Customer Management (Customer Service is a hot component)<br />
<br />
· Products (Promotions Management is a hot component)<br />
<br />
· Rental Fleet Logistics (Fleet Management is a hot component)<br />
<br />
· Rentals Management (Rentals and Reservations is a hot component)<br />
<br />
Domains are broken into functional areas by identifying major functional responsibilities for each in-scope domain:
Marketing and Customer management, Products, Rental Fleet Logistics, and Rentals Management. CBM Components provide the
starting point for this analysis and in many cases can be considered as functional areas. <br />
<br />
A major functional area of the Marketing and Customer Management domain is Customer Service. Since Customer Service
directly pertains to the running example (it can play a direct role in rental-related activities), it will be further
analyzed by the Functional Area Analysis. Other functional areas of this domain may be of interest to a different
initiative. Since they do not play direct role in this specific example, they will not be analyzed in detail at this
time.<br />
<br />
For the Product domain, Promotions Management is a major functional area identified for further analysis, since promotions
affect rental pricing (note the Pricing Management CBM Business Component in the related CBM Competency). Once again,
although there are other functional areas that fall within this domain, the focus area for Functional Area Analysis will be
on the functional areas that are directly relevant to this SOA initiative.<br />
<br />
Fleet Management is a major functional area for the Rental Fleet Logistics domain that plays a role in the reservation
process, for example where vehicle availability information is important. <br />
<br />
Rentals Management has been decomposed into three major functional areas: Rental, Reservations, and Pricing. In this case
the hot component “Rentals and Reservations” does not map one to one to functional areas as was the case for the other
domains. The Reservation and Rental functional areas provide the most customer visible aspects of the car rental
experience. Pricing is a key function for completing a reservation, as well as for completion of the vehicle rental at
check-in (note that the function being referred to here is not the same as Pricing Management – Pricing in this domain
involves setting a price for a specific reservation or rental based on a number of factors such as type of vehicle, type of
customer, etc.). These will be the core functional areas for the next steps in the running example.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><font size="3">Functional Area Interactions and Dependencies</font></strong><br />
<br />
Functional areas interact as business processes are being carried out. This section describes each in-scope functional area
identified in the previous section. Descriptions of functional Areas are organized by business domain. (Note that this
could alternatively have been represented using the table shown in the notation section).<br />

<p>
    <strong><font size="3">Mapping Functional Areas to Subsystems</font></strong><br />
    <br />
    Functional areas are mapped to candidate subsystems in the Rent-a-car Functional Areas to Subsystem Cross Reference
    example. There will typically be a close match between business function and subsystems, enhancing the traceability
    from business context to IT context.
