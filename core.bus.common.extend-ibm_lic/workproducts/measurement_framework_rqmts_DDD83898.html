    <b><font size="2" face="Arial">Process Measurement</font></b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>A growing number of enterprises are adopting some form of a balanced scorecard to communicate strategic plans and to
    identify both leading and lagging measurements critical to realizing those plans.</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>A basic principle of the balanced scorecard is that measurement targets are identified for different perspectives.
    These are:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Financial Perspective <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">–</font> <font size="2" face="Arial">the top
        perspective that focuses on measuring whether an organization is achieving its financial goal</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">Customer Perspective</font> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">–</font> <font         size="2" face="Arial">focuses on what must be done, what</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">’</font><font         size="2" face="Arial">s most important, from the customer</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">’</font><font         size="2" face="Arial">s perspective to achieve the Financial Perspective</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">Internal Process Perspective</font> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">–</font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">focuses on what an organization must be doing well to meet the customer needs defined
        in the Customer Perspective</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">Learning & Growth Perspective</font> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">–</font>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">focuses on how an organization is improving its ability to innovate, improve, and learn
        in order to support success with the critical operations and processes defined in the Internal Process
        Perspective</font>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">Developing a balanced scorecard can take several months and involve a number of levels of
    management. To achieve the measurements identified in the scorecard will more than likely require initiating new
    business initiatives and numerous projects. This is outside the scope of this work product and should be viewed as a
    management process focused on strategic planning. However, developing metrics for an end-to-end process may be driven
    by measurement targets identified in a balanced scorecard or other well define measurement program within the
    enterprise. It is extremely important to leverage these when defining a Performance Framework.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">Whether a balanced scorecard exists or not, it is extremely important to identify the
    metrics for core strategic drivers and then decompose those into operational metrics that can be allocated to
    end-to-end business processes.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">For business processes, the Measurement Framework defines the method in which metrics will
    be applied to measure business results for end-to-end processes. It translates the high-level business performance
    objectives of an end-to-end process into an integrated set of lower-level metrics and targets for each of the component
    processes that may be performed in different organizations to ensure that individual process performance contributes
    optimally to the achievement of the end-to-end process objectives.</font>
</p><font size="2"><br />
</font> 
<p>
    <b><font size="2" face="Arial">Organizational Measurement</font></b>
</p>
<p>
    When considering performance measurements you should also consider developing measurements for the organizations that
    support processes. The idiom <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">"</font><font size="2" face="Arial">people do what
    they</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">’</font><font size="2" face="Arial">re paid to do</font><font size="2"     face="Times New Roman">"</font> <font size="2" face="Arial">can result in negative process performance results if
    organizational measurements are not aligned with process measurements. Therefore, it is important that organizational
    (people) measurements, with appropriate incentives and rewards, motivate process performers in a way that supports the
    goals and objectives of the end-to-end processes.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">Since process performers may have a functional responsibilities unrelated to their process
    responsibilities, you may need to consider proportioning measurements between more than one perspective, e.g. process
    results and function unit results.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">An enterprise typically sets a structure of incentives and rewards to motivate employees to
    behave in a way that helps the enterprise achieve certain business goals or objectives. However, this structure is
    often focused on behaviors that are associated with the objectives of specific organizations within the enterprise that
    may have little or nothing to do with end-to-end process performance.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">Once processes have been restructured and integrated to deliver end-to-end business
    results, the incentives and rewards of the people performing those processes should be examined, and, where
    appropriate, realigned with the end-to-end results. This realignment should encourage the types of behavior that helps
    the enterprise achieve its end-to-end process performance targets.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">For example, a customer support center may decide that it</font><font size="2"     face="Times New Roman">’</font><font size="2" face="Arial">s important to handle as many customer calls per day as
    possible and recognize and reward those individuals with the highest call volume (even if the same customer has to call
    multiple times to resolve a problem). However, if the goal of the end-to-end customer relationship management process
    is to achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, the customer support process may contribute more effectively by
    focusing on the number of customer problems resolved on the first call. This might lead to longer calls and fewer calls
    by customer service representative, but a higher level of customer satisfaction.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">Rewarding the right behavior will, in many cases, mean redefining what the right behavior
    is in light of the higher level business objectives and measures.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <b><font size="2" face="Arial">Service Level Agreements</font></b>
</p>
<p>
    Each process has certain performance and nonfunctional requirements that have to be met by the organizations that
    execute or enable the process (e.g., IT, 3<sup>rd</sup> party service providers, etc.). These requirements need to be
    defined, documented, communicated, accepted and then managed by those involved in order to maintain satisfactory
    performance of the processes.
</p>
<p>
    Service Level Agreements (SLAs) serve as a clear and unambiguous definition of the responsibilities of all the
    participants in a process and are used to manage ongoing performance and respond to process execution problems and
    issues.
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">Internally, within the enterprise, process managers depends on others to meet their
    performance commitments in order to maintain the effective operation and performance of the processes under his or her
    control. These commitments may define the required performance of other process areas that provide services to one
    process area or they may define the required performance of the technology that enables the process. In either case,
    the explicit definition, communication and commitment to performance requirements and objectives is critical to the
    operation of an enterprise.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">When dealing with 3<sup>rd</sup> party providers (e.g., payroll service providers), the
    SLAs define the relationship and the responsibilities of the parties and serve as the basis for assessing and managing
    the performance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> party providers.</font>
