    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service
    portfolio or service model.
</p>
<p>
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.
</p>
<p>
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;
    </li>
    <li>
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;
    </li>
    <li>
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The IT Services Strategy could potentially lead to significant changes to the set of IT services provided and the way
    in which they are sourced and delivered. As a consequence it could have far-reaching implications for the IT
    organization, it's skills, processes and tools.
</p><p/><p>
    It is therefore important that the work product be reviewed and accepted by the client sponsor. The recommendations and
    their implications should be fully discussed, understood and signed off. The “strategic fit” of the recommended
    services strategy and solution approach can often be validated by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Deriving from the service definitions the characteristics of the processes, organization and tools necessary to
            enable creation and delivery of the required services.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Deriving from the IT Services Assessment an indication of the maturity of the enablers and analyzing the gap
            between the current and required states.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Assessing the ability of the client IT organization to make this required transformation.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If it is suspected that the strategic IT services portfolio will entail a substantial transformation of the client’s
    current IT capabilities, then all the necessary planning, design and implementation activities should be called out at
    this stage and reflected in the transition plan.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Defining IT Services</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    The level of granularity at which the IT services are defined will depend upon the scope and objectives of the
    engagement.<br />
    The perspective one takes when discussing services has a profound impact on the result. Different roles in the
    discussion provide different perspectives. One can take the provider’s perspective, for example, and get one view. If,
    however, one takes the customer (or consumer) view, one can get an entirely different perspective on the topic of
    services. Neither is right or wrong, but definitely yield different results. Further complicating the perspective issue
    is the fact that it isn't always easy to determine the role of customer/provider, and the roles can change.
</p>
<p>
    This leads into the second important issue, context. The only means to resolve the specific question of
    customer/provider is to put the discussion in some context. For example, an IT organization can supply a 'service' to a
    business unit, which then bundles that capability with skills / resources of their own to supply a service to an
    external consumer. From the perspective of the IT organization, they are supply a complete service to the business
    unit. From the business unit's perspective, the IT component is simply one element in a service they supply to the
    consumer. In addition, from the consumer's perspective, the 'service' supplied by the business unit is one element in a
    complete range of services provided by the enterprise.
</p>
<p>
    The last issue, scale, is just as confusing. It is difficult to develop a consistent means to identify a complete
    service, versus some fragment of a service - what might be called a service element, or component. The difficulty is
    that, once again, this changes with perspective and context. In the world of tangible products, one company might
    manufacture a complete assembly, made up of subassemblies. This complete 'assembly,' however, is viewed by another
    manufacturer as a 'subassembly' of an even larger product. So, is the original product an assembly or subassembly? That
    depends on your client and their perspective.<br />
    <img height="530" alt="IT Services Strategy3" src="./../../core.tech.common.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/it_services_strategy_03.jpg" width="764" /><br />
    <br />
    Services provide yet one more viewpoint from which to focus on that, which is important to the successful delivery of
    IT, capability, in a given context. A service perspective does not replace, or compete, or conflict with other enablers
    such as functional processes, organization or tools. One can’t implement a service without consideration of the process
    activities, organization elements and tools required to do so.
</p>
<p>
    What is most important is the view of our customers/clients, WHICH WILL CHANGE BASED ON THEIR CONTEXT AND PERSPECTIVE.
    While we need to demonstrate some measure of leadership and understanding of the topic, more importantly, we need to be
    adaptable enough to alter our viewpoint of the subject of services to fit that of our clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Strategy</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    The term “strategy” can be interpreted in many different ways and frequently the client will have a slightly different
    view of what constitutes a strategy. There will generally be agreement though that a strategy says something about the
    client’s desired future strategic position, the way they will operate, and the way they will achieve that position.
</p>
<p>
    In agreeing the scope of “strategy” with the client, it may be useful to think of “the strategy” as a deliverable which
    may encompass several components according to the wishes of the client. From an IT services perspective these could
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            (IT) future state vision
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            (IT) strategic business scenarios
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            IT services strategy
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            principles, policies and guidelines
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            IT infrastructure management model
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            IT services sourcing decisions
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            IT services transition plan&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The IT Services Strategy should also be validated against other related work products to ensure that they are
    consistent and that the strategy does indeed address the business requirements, moves the client towards their desired
    strategic vision and is aligned with the client’s governance model. In particular, the IT Services Strategy should be
    validated against:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            the client’s future state vision
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            IT principles, policies and guidelines
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            current IT assessment
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
