    The project repository can be a central point of failure for all assets, and therefore needs to be reliable, fault
    tolerant, scalable to accommodate mode data and have high performance so as not to impede product development. The key
    hardware considerations (in order of priority) for the project repository are the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Memory Requirements</strong>: Memory is one of the cheapest ways to improve the performance of a CM Tool. A
        rule of thumb for how much main memory is required in the server machine is to add all the database space used by
        the project repository, and divide by two. For example, 1MB of main memory should be sufficient to allow for
        caching and background data writing for 2MB of database space. The assumption is that half of the data in the
        project repository will be actively accessed at any given time. Server machines should have a minimum of 256MB. On
        the client side, each developer's machine should have a minimum of 128MB of main memory.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Disk Input / Output Requirements</strong>: The second most likely performance bottleneck in the CM
        environment is the speed at which the data can be written to disk. Read/write intensive operations are check-in,
        check-out and baseline creation. It is a good idea to have a dedicated controller and channel per disk.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Network Bandwidth</strong>: Since the CM tool is usually a distributed application, adequate network
        capacity and reliability are required for good performance. The recommendation is to put machines hosting the
        project repository and views on the same subnet. And if the local area network (LAN) is too saturated as indicated
        by time outs and poor response, the idea is to increase network capacity or add a subnet for the CM tool hosing
        machine.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Project Repository Disk Space</strong>: Depending on the size of a project there could be multiple project
        repositories, and each project repository could contain tens of thousands of files and directories. The number of
        files in any given project repository will depend on the size of the machine on which the repository server is
        running, and the number of users expected to concurrently access data. An active read/write code development
        project repository can hold less elements than a less volatile repository that does not have the same level of user
        traffic. For a software development project repository expect to hold approximately 3000 to 5000 elements in the
        repository. A good rule of thumb is to allow disk space for growth, and have about 50% free space by allocating 2
        giga-bytes of storage per project repository.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The project repository should be on a dedicated server. This means the project repository server should <b>not</b> be
    used for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        compiles, builds or testing
    </li>
    <li>
        running other third party tools
