    This artifact’s terminology is defined within the System Description Standard R3 Semantic Specification (see Guidance
    for link) which includes definitions for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Actors (and workers) – the roles a user or an external system play with respect to the target system
    </li>
    <li>
        Components - modular units of functionality, which make this functionality available through an interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment Units – a grouping of facets of a component that have similar characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connectors – enable the exchange of messages (interactions) between resource containers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interactions – identify the messages exchanged between one or two resource containers in the context of a
        collaboration, and the sequencing of these messages via their associated send/receive events.
    </li>
    <li>
        Nodes - a collection of components fulfilling a specific responsibility with a certain quality of service within
        the target system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connections - supports the required connectivity between connectable model elements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Zones – an aggregation of a number of model elements with a common (sub-) set of values for a particular
        non-functional requirement and/or non-functional characteristic.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A deployment unit (DU) is used to represent the various operational facets of <em>components</em> including their
    non-functional requirement’s and service level characteristics.
</p>
<p>
    Deployment units may represent both <em>application</em> and <em>technical</em> components.
</p>
<p>
    A deployment unit is considered as a single unit for requirements analysis and placement considerations.
</p>
<p>
    A deployment unit associates or references additional information with the different facets of a component (e.g.,
    resource requirements, service level requirements, and technical dependencies) that are either relevant or related to
    the placement of the component onto the nodes of an IT System.
</p>
<p>
    Components defined within the functional aspect of the architecture of an IT system have four different operational
    facets:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Presentation; the presentation between the IT system and its users and/or between the IT system and IT systems, as
        delivered by the components responsible for presentation to these external actors.
    </li>
    <li>
        Execution; the operational execution of the component within the IT system (i.e where the execution code that
        implements the component will be loaded as a process and run on an IT platform central processing unit) and the
        associated resource demands such as “transactions per second” or “required response time”.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Data; the data the component uses together with it’s persistence characteristics such as “size of record”, “number
        of records”, rate of change”, or “currency”
    </li>
    <li>
        Installation; a component’s installation files, such as its .EXE and .INI files (i.e. where its executables and
        configuration/context data will be stored), together with its installation characteristics such as “executable
        size”.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A component may have any one or all of the above facets depending on what the component does.&nbsp; But, all components
    must have an Execution facet since all components perform at least one action when implemented in an IT system.
</p>
<p>
    Deployment units (DUs) are groupings of these operational facets. The deployment units aggregate the requirements and
    characteristics of the grouped component facets.
</p>
<p>
    Groupings are made for a particular facet type and therefore deployment units are associated with a specific facet:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Presentation DU; groupings of the presentation facets of components.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Execution DU; groupings of the execution facets of components
    </li>
    <li>
        Data DU; groupings of the data facets of components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Installation DU; groupings of the installation facets of components.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the development approach adopted and/or the context, it can be very helpful to create levels of this
    artifact.&nbsp; The two basic levels of this artifact are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Logical</strong>:&nbsp; This level describes the characteristics and capabilities of deployment units in a
        <strong>technology independent and product neutral</strong> manner.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physical</strong>:&nbsp; This level describes characteristics and capabilities of deployment units in a
        <strong>technology and product dependent</strong> manner.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both levels of this artifact may be further described at three different sub-levels relating to the degree to which the
    level has been sized:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Unsized</strong> (or unranged) – the technology and products are specified to support the components
        deployed but not sized and without detailing how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Ranged</strong> – the technology and products are specified to support a bounded range of requirements for
        a defined range of circumstances.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sized</strong> – the technology and products are specified and sized to support the components deployed and
        details how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.&nbsp;
    </li>

    The non-functional requirements and the characteristics for a deployment unit may not necessarily be the same as for
    the individual components represented by the deployment unit.&nbsp; They may be more or less demanding – although it is
    recommended that an explanation of the difference between requirements and characteristics be provided.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    If there are no differences, and component splitting and/or grouping has been simple, a reference to the appropriate
    component description will suffice.
</p>
<p>
    Generally, an IT system’s non-functional requirements and, in particular, its service level characteristics of
    performance, availability and security may be associated with a particular type of deployment unit, representing the
    facet of the individual components from which the solution’s architecture is constructed.&nbsp; For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A required workload, described in terms of “transactions per second” or “visits per hour” is associated with an
        execution DU, representing the execution facets of the involved components, and helps in deriving the CPU sizing of
        nodes
    </li>
    <li>
        The need to support a specific number of customer records, each of a certain size, is associated with a data DU,
        representing the data facets of the involved components, and helps in deriving the disk capacity of nodes
    </li>
    <li>
        The need to provide a mobile user with a graphical user interface is associated with a presentation DU,
        representing the presentation facets of the involved component(s), and helps in deriving the selection of a hand
        held terminal (HHT).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The placement of deployment units on nodes is within the operational aspect of the architecture of the IT system.&nbsp;
    In order for an operational model to achieve the functional and non-functional requirements for the IT system, it is
    invariably necessary to locate:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The various facets of each component in different locations.&nbsp; For example, the data facets of a component may
        be held centrally, while its execution takes place on a workstation and its executables are stored on a
        departmental file server.
    </li>
    <li>
        A particular facet of a component in multiple locations and/or location types.&nbsp; For example: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                under normal circumstances a component may execute on a server, but in the event of network failure the
                same component may be required to execute on the workstation,&nbsp; or
            </li>
            <li>
                the primary copy of a component’s data may be held on a central server, but an operational copy – or
                replica is available on the workstation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Generally, this placement relates to all (application and technical) components, and therefore all deployment inits.
</p>
<p>
    Deployment units need to address placement to address security requirements.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Components may need to be separated by zone boundaries to address risk management concerns e.g., highly trusted
        componets may be separated from low trust level components or separation may be required to address the Privacy
        implications of storing specified data together.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment units for flow control may be required to secure data flows separated across different zones.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Different deployment units may also be needed for different trust environments to fullfill the functional security
    requirements within the different trust environments.
