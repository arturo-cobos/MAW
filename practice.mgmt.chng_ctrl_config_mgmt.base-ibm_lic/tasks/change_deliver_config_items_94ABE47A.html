    The work order from project management is a stimulus to any work being performed on a project. On being given a work
    order, team members will typically plan their work by creating "to do" lists with due dates that meet the "contract"
    outlined in the work order.
</p>
<p>
    The next step is for the responsible role to get or create the necessary work products that need to be worked on or
    added to source control.
</p>
<p>
    Projects usually maintain controlled versions of work products in a central, restricted access, repository.
    <em>Check-In</em> and <em>Check-Out</em> are the operations that enable development staff to obtain a particular
    version of a work product, make changes to it, and re-submit it to become the latest controlled version. The purpose of
    this step is to ensure that developers follow 'check-in and check-out' procedures to make changes to version controlled
    work products.
</p>
<p>
    The primary&nbsp;configuration management&nbsp;operations performed by any member of the development staff are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a id="XE_configuration_item__check-out" name="XE_configuration_item__check-out"></a><b>Check Out</b> - Grants
        permission to change an element
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a id="XE_configuration_item__check-in" name="XE_configuration_item__check-in"></a><b>Check In</b> - Stores a new
        version of the changed element and makes changes available for <em>Check-Out</em> by other team members. A
        recommended policy is that every check-in be accompanied by a brief comment describing the change.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Add to Source Control</b> - Places a new file or directory under version control, creating the initial version
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Deliver</b> - Submits changes to the integrator.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rebase</b> - Makes changes made by other developers available to your view.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    An&nbsp;developer will typically work in the following manner:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Checks out the files that need to be changed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Makes the changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Performs unit tests to verify the changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gets the changes approved.
    </li>
    <li>
        Checks in the changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Promote the changes.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <br />
    <b>Different Kinds of Check-Out</b><br />
    <br />
    By default, checking out an element grants the exclusive right to create a new version of it. This is called a
    R<i>eserved Check-Out</i>. Another user who attempts a reserved checkout of that element is prevented from doing so.
</p>
<p>
    In parallel development situations, an <i>unreserved checkout</i> is a mechanism to checkout a file even if someone
    else has already checked it out.<br />
    <br />
    Some organizations routinely use a first-come/first-served style of development, in which multiple users perform an
    unreserved <em>Check-Out</em> of the same element. Any one of them can subsequently perform a <em>Check-In</em>, to
    create the next version of that file. Each of the others must <i>merge</i> these changes with previously checked in
    changes before creating a subsequent version.

    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Delivery addresses the notion of integration of work from streams of implementers. As such, delivery is an
        important step and a 'quality gate' of reviews and approvals need to be passed before work can be accepted into a
        higher level 'staging area'.
    </p>
    <p>
        A good project policy is to require developers to rebase their development workspaces to the project's current
        recommended baseline before accepting their work into the project's integration workspace. The goal of this policy
        is to have developers build and test their work in their development areas against the work included in the most
        recent stable baselines before they deliver to the integration workspace. This practice minimizes the amount of
        merging that developers must do when they perform deliver operations.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        Another good project policy is to ensure that all files are checked-in prior to delivery. This avoids the situation
        of having orphaned files that are not included in a build and might be needed for subsequent updates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Delivery is an important step that implies that a developer considers his work to be of sufficiently high quality
        to be incorporated into the overall product.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should be part of the project policy on who is to review given work products, and what level of quality they are
        to have achieved before being acceptable for usage by the rest of the project team members.&nbsp; Many of the work
        products in have an associated '<i>checklist</i>' that can be used to assess the quality of that work product. For
        instance, if an work product is found to be deficient on more than a given number of checkpoints it is submitted
        for re-work, and thereby not eligible for 'promotion'.

</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        A common project policy is to require the developer to merge his/her changes with those made by other developers.
        This is typically done in a private integration workspace, so that the merged changes may be tested prior to final
        delivery to the project integration workspace. The delivery is complete when all merge changes have been checked-in
        and delivered.

    It is an essential part of any&nbsp;configuration management&nbsp;system to ensure that work products are under version
    control, and that team members have access to approved baselines. The idea of updating views to ensure access to the
    most recent collective body of work is obvious. This task needs to be easy to do and occur on an ongoing basis.
</p>
<p>
    Each team member having updated a view, can work on any work product through the standard process of 'check-out, edit,
    build, unit test, and check-in' as outlined in the configuration management procedures.
