        The Use Case Model which defines the identification-level use cases for the solution and their high level

    This deliverable expands upon the work outlined in previous requirements by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Adding detailed interface characteristics to the existing system context diagram for number of instances, available
        access time, type of communication, hardware brand/model, operating system brand, volume and frequencies.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Defining the actor-system interactions for the use cases included in this Release, document the expected usage and
        behaviors of the system, and restructure and layer the use case model to separate out commonality and avoid
        redundancy.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Refining the non-functional requirements, which define the service level requirements, system constraints, and
        other technical properties for the solution, to produce a complete description of the defined minimum and maximum
        acceptable criteria for the system.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Refining and extending the usability requirements identified during the earlier phase, as needed, to further
        identify the requirements for the solution and to add measurement details.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Documenting the business rules in order to communicate policy issues relative to the scope of the solution.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The customer will provide input to the IBM team to define/refine the requirements.&nbsp; This includes providing input
    regarding use cases, non-functional requirements, usability requirements, and potential business and I/T changes for
    the IBM project team refining the requirements.&nbsp; Additional information regarding information exchanges that will
    be required between the new solution and the external entities that will need to interface with the solution, including
    the information that must be input and/or output in the exchanges.

    This document will be comprised of information formatted for delivery to the client extracted from the following work
    products:
</p>
<p>
    <u>Business Rules Catalog</u> – provides the detailed business rules that need to be enforced by the system.&nbsp; Each
    business rule that is to be implemented by the system needs to be explicitly defined along with any necessary formulas
    or criteria.&nbsp; Business rules that are not implemented in code but may affect the system should also be documented
    here with a brief description explaining how conformance will be achieved.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Change Cases (optional)</u> – defines any additional possible changes to existing requirements.&nbsp; For each
    change case it will be necessary to clearly document whether it is or out of scope.&nbsp; For in scope change cases the
    likely-hood of each changes case including conditions for the change, as well as it’s expected impact need to be fully
    documented.&nbsp; Any assumptions on which this information is based need to also be included in the change case.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Non-functional Requirements</u> – defines the technical requirements and business constraints that will affect the
    development of the system.&nbsp; Business constraints need to be clearly defined along with their expected impact to
    the development effort.&nbsp; The technical non-functional requirements such as items dealing with performance and
    capacity need to be defined to a measurable level so that it is possible to judge whether each requirement has been
    met.
</p>
<p>
    <u>System Context</u> – is a graphical representation of all other systems that will interact with the new
    solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; For each system the exact calls that will need to be supported along with the expected data
    volumes and any limitations on availability need to also be documented.&nbsp; Any other criteria related to these
    systems that may have a limiting affect on the new solution or require additional work should also be documented.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Usability Requirements</u> – defines the requirements in relation to the user experience of the new system.&nbsp;
    Each usability requirements must be tied to a specific user profile and defined to a measurable state.&nbsp; Any
    assumptions or pre-conditions should also be identified along with the expected task, completion time, completion
    criteria and number of errors.&nbsp; The goal is to provide a set of requirements that can be measured during usability
    testing with candidates that match the specified user profile.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Use Case Model</u> – details all necessary functions the system needs to support from an end user or external system
    perspective.&nbsp; The use case model should include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Full list of actors and definitions for each along with any other required information
    </li>
    <li>
        Full list of use cases including: subject area, actor, use case name, description, triggering event, preconditions
        and associated usability information
    </li>
    <li>
        Termination outcomes for each use case (these may optionally be represented in a decision table)
    </li>
    <li>
        Use case scenarios (minimum of optimal with alternative paths being shown for all major areas of functionality and
        typical error conditions)&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Flow of events or system sequence diagram
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The final document will be delivered to the customer in a reproducible format.&nbsp; The final report may also be
    delivered in hard copy format printed in a single, bound document.<br />
