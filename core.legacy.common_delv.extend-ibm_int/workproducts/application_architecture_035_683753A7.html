<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The content of this deliverable is used in several different ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The application principle component is used to tie the content of the application architecture back, initially to
        the previously defined business architecture and, finally to the desired business strategy, directions and
        capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        The application architecture components are used to clearly define an enterprise-level framework of application
        functions, packages and solutions, which will ensure the desired processes, information, events and business
        structure previously defined, are implemented effectively from a business perspective.
    </li>
    <li>
        The chosen set of one or more ‘reference architectures’ will provide known, proven combinations of application
        architecture components, which will improve the productivity of future design activities. They also drastically
        improve the opportunities for implementing rationalized architectural components, which can be effectively reused.
    </li>
    <li>
        These application architecture components in turn, will be subsequently used as a direct input to defining the
        framework of data and technology/infrastructure (an IT Architecture) components that need to be implemented to
        support the identified application functions, if the business is to achieve its desired strategy.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Subsequent engagements/projects will take subsets of the business and application architecture deliverables, plus the
    chosen reference architectures, as inputs to defining, designing and implementing specific solutions, for example, CRM,
    ERP, e-Procurement, etc.

    <li>
        At an enterprise-level (Conceptual Architecture as defined in the IBM Architecture Description Standard) - where
        the focus is on understanding all the application functions which will need to be defined and implemented across
        the enterprise. This includes documenting the inter-relationships and dependencies and opportunities for
        standardization and sharing of components across various divisional and organizational groups - could include
        future partners and joint ventures if required.
    </li>
    <li>
        At a solution level (Conceptual and Functional Architectures as defined in the IBM Architecture Description
        Standard) - where the focus is on understanding the application functions, inter-dependencies and sharing of
        components possible for a given business area. Examples would include CRM, ERP and e-Procurement. A solution level
        Application Architecture is a subset of the enterprise-level Application Architecture, often produced to a more
        detailed level.

</ul>
<p>
    This definition of both these levels has been included here for clarification.
</p>
<p>
    In this DCD, we will focus on the Application Architecture deliverables produced at the enterprise level, as an output
    from phase 4 of the Business Architecture - Quickstart engagement model.
</p>
<p>
    This content of this deliverable should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A reminder of the overall scope, objectives and deliverables of the engagement
    </li>
    <li>
        An overview of the application principles, which will underpin all subsequent application design and package and IT
        acquisition decisions. This includes a matrix of principles to desired capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        A high-level application model showing the major ‘application groups’ defined their functional boundaries and the
        relationship between the groupings. These application groups are linked back to the business architecture
        components defined in the previous phase, to show how they support and implement the desired capabilities. The
        degree, to which these application groups are decomposed will be governed by the time, resources and skills
        available.
    </li>
    <li>
        A chosen set of one or more ‘reference’ architectures, which will be used to guide application design, package
        evaluation and solution implementation activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        An overview of how this application architecture deliverable forms a key component part of an overall
        enterprise-wide IT Architecture and feeds into subsequent IT Architecture definition activities (could be defined
        using the IT Architecture - Quickstart engagement model)
    </li>
    <li>
        A summary of any key issues relating to the above application architecture components, which need senior management

    The above description and purpose statements provide a summary of suitable words for inclusion in any client documents.
</p>
<p>
    Experience has shown that there is no single agreed industry definition of the content of an application architecture
    (AA) - the following provides a generic definition of an AA at the enterprise level, which is useful as a base point
    for discussing and agreeing the scope and content of business architecture definition activities within a specific
    client engagement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> An Application Architecture provides a classification of applications and the set of
    rules, which govern how applications will interoperate, distribute function and share information across an
    organization. It will normally be based on the business process/data model and will provide a framework that defines
    the structure and design of the functional components of the business systems and their inter-relationship with each
    other.
</p>
<p>
    An Application Architecture would normally include the following:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Application design principles - these principles will act as fundamental rules and provide guidance for the
        development of the application structure and the relationships between applications.
    </li>
    <li>
        An application function model – highlights the key groupings of application function required by the business,
        based on the previously defined business processes and activities. These application groups are linked back to the
        business architecture components defined in the previous phase, to show how they support and implement the desired
        capabilities. The level, to which these application groups are de-composed will be governed by the time, resources
        and skills available.
    </li>
    <li>
        Application computing standards and models - sets of rules that allow individual applications to communicate,
        coexist, share data, and to be developed and enhanced without mutual disruption: - Rules for how applications will
        communicate with each other, including application interface standards - Rules for how different applications will
        coexist across one or more systems These models often come from reference architectures for example, the
        Business-to-Business computing models specified in the IBM ‘Patterns for e-Business’.
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        Company strategy for the distribution of processes and function (not developed in this BAQ engagement model, but
        additional guidance is available in the IT Architecture – Quickstart engagement model if required)
    </li>

        Catalog of current applications (for example by type/function, structure, application model, data organization,
        processor type, storage and I/O requirements) – captured as part of the Current IT Environment WP.

<p>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong> An Application Architecture is a constituent part of an overall Enterprise Architecture. It
    is used, along with the Data Architecture, to define the application and data functional components, which will meet
    the business requirements and, which must be supported by the Technical Architecture, which underpins it. Note: see the
    IT Architecture – Quickstart engagement model for further details on how to define the Data and Technical Architecture
    components of an overall IT Architecture.<br />

    The Application Architecture deliverable assembles the work product outputs into a format, which is suitable for the
    client. The format typically includes two parts:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Specific entries in a database or web application – as defined and agreed as part of the Architecture Delivery
        Environment – see the DCD for Architecture Management Framework for further details
    </li>
    <li>
        Presentation material, which summarizes the content of each of the component parts.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The content of the deliverable and its (associated) presentation material is used to educate and inform key client
    business and IT stakeholders, at a more detailed level, of the future application environment, as known and defined so
    far. This is to ensure that they are sufficiently knowledgeable, motivated and engaged in the subsequent development of
    solutions to specific business problems or issues, for example, more detailed application design and package evaluation
    and selection activities.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, the key business users and IT stakeholders will have been heavily involved in developing the content of
    this deliverable. The objective here is to summarize the material produced into a form, which is suitable for senior
    client executives, to provide them with a clear perspective of the overall application environment required by the
    business. In particular, the Application Principles that have been defined will have far reaching effects, in terms of
    business and IT management and the way application component and package selection decisions will be made in future.
    For example, it will probably no longer be the prerogative of individual divisions/divisional management to make
    package selection decisions in isolation.
</p>
<p>
    Combine the work product inputs/outputs using the following structure and guidance:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Use ENG 315 to provide an overview of the overall scope, objectives and deliverables of the engagement and remind
        key stakeholders of the value of these activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a summary of the Business Architecture Context and Business Architecture deliverables produced in previous
        phases to remind stakeholders of the work that has been completed so far. Confirm their understanding of what the
        enterprise is and aspires to become, how it intends to achieve its goals and make the desired transition, and by
        what means.
    </li>
    <li>
        In particular, show how the key business processes and information flows produced using BUS 312 Process
        Identification, ARC 307 Enterprise Information Model and APP 112 Process – Data Usage, in previous phases, have
        been used as inputs to defining the Application Architecture components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the application principles defined using ARC 309, and the matrix of principles to key capabilities, to
        highlight both how these principles link back to and support, the previously agreed business directions and desired
        capabilities. Show how they will be used to drive future business and IT acquisition and design decisions. Use
        examples of their associated motivation and implication statements to demonstrate the impact of the decisions made
        so far and to maintain the support of key stakeholders – many of these principles will raise cultural and
        management style changes, which will inevitably challenge certain stakeholders – these issues are raised so they
        can be addressed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a combination of the models and diagrams produced using ARC 101 Architecture Overview Diagram and ARC 302
        Application Function Model to show the main component parts of the application architecture and the linkages, flows
        and interfaces between application groups. Emphasize how these outputs will be used to drive future IT and solution
        rationalization activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the outputs from the ARC 102 Reference Architecture Fit –Gap Analysis to highlight the chosen reference
        architectures. Identify any additional follow-on actions required to establish these reference architectures as
        standard design ‘patterns’ for all future application design/development project activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the outputs from BUS 005 Critical Issues – Opportunities and Recommendations to focus on any major issues,
        which have been highlighted by these application architecture definition activities. Highlight any assumptions made
        which need to be validated by senior business and IT executives, or any key observations/insights which are already
        apparent and which senior management need to start considering, in their day-to-day business management/decision
        making activities.
    </li>
</ul>

    Summarize the results and detailed content of this deliverable in BUS 321 Executive Briefing Package, ready for
    presentation to senior executives and key stakeholders.<br />
