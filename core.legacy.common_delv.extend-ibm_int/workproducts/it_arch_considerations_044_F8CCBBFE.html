    The contents of this deliverable provide a clear foundation for the prioritization and funding of future initiatives
    and projects, to further develop and implement the IT Architecture which has been defined. The content of this
    deliverable is used in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To build on the work done so far by initiating projects to further define and implement the newly defined IT
        Architecture and the associated governance framework
    </li>
    <li>
        The gaps highlighted between the current environment and the newly defined architectures, will enable the business
        to make conscious decisions about how it wants to move forward
    </li>
    <li>
        The outputs from the gap analysis activities are also used to identify ways in which future and ongoing development
        projects can be refocused (without necessarily changing development budgets) to conform to the architectures and
        thus more effectively support the long-term business strategy
    </li>
    <li>
        The rationalized set of transition initiatives is prioritized and incorporated into a transition strategy, based on
        business need, enabling the business to make prompt decisions, regarding future investment, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        To make recommendations on short-term management decisions and actions (to be taken in the next 3 months), which
        will help to ensure that the activities started during the engagement are continued, with appropriate levels of
        management sponsorship. This includes recommendations for follow-on IBM involvement

    The above description and purpose statements provide an excellent summary of suitable words for inclusion in any client
    documents.<br />
    However, the following words may be useful for positioning the content of this deliverable as part of a proposal, or
    during engagement planning activities.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>GAP ANALYSIS ACTIVITIES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Gap Analysis component of the IT Architecture Transition Considerations deliverable focuses on new projects (either
    under development, or in plan to be implemented within the next 3 years). It documents the gaps between the components
    of the newly defined IT Architecture and the ‘default IT Architectures’ used in each development project. In this
    instance, the analysis looks at criteria like support for future business directions, implementation of desired
    business capabilities and the functional and technical fit of these new projects. The outputs are used to guide
    requirements gathering, design and product/package selection decisions (which often happen early on in the development
    lifecycle). The key here is to ‘catch’ individual projects, before major design and acquisition decisions are made,
    which may not be in line with the overall business objectives and desired key capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    In these gap analysis activities, the principles, desired business capabilities and future architecture models
    (application, data and technology/infrastructure) defined in the IT Architecture Context and IT Architecture DCDs are
    used as key inputs.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>TRANSITION ACTIVITIES - TRANSITION INITIATIVES, TRANSITION STRATEGY and TRANSITION PLAN</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Note: in this ITA-Q engagement model, only transition initiatives are normally defined. If the scope of a specific
    engagement needs to include the definition of a transition strategy and a plan to implement this, additional time and
    resources will be required.
</p>
<p>
    Transition activities, from an enterprise-wide architecture perspective, are focused on identifying the key elements of
    the business and I/T environment, which must change in order to implement the target architectures. During the previous
    phases of this engagement model, various transition issues and requirements will be identified. These are combined
    here, into a prioritized set of transition initiatives, which will deliver and implement the desired business and IT
    environment. The transition initiatives are subsequently used as a basis for defining transition scenarios that
    evaluate alternative ways of achieving the desired transformation within acceptable time frames. The chosen transition
    scenario is encapsulated in a transition strategy and finally in a transition plan with a prioritized, budgeted,
    sequenced set of projects, which can be implemented.
</p>
<p>
    Some simple definitions may help here:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Transition Initiative activities:</strong>
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Define the various initiatives needed to help the business move towards its desired business and IT environments
    </li>
    <li>
        Group initiatives so they can be tied back to the desired distinctive capabilities
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
    <strong>Transition Strategy activities:</strong>
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Define various transition scenarios – alternative ways of combining the transition initiatives and projects
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider timescales, benefits, costing and resource options, risk and availability of skills
    </li>
    <li>
        Match each scenario to the desired distinctive capabilities and business priorities
    </li>
    <li>
        Define a recommended transition approach, normally with a 1 to 3 year timeframe
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
    <strong>Transition Planning activities:</strong>
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Take the chosen transition scenario and strategy and consider the costs and sequencing of initiatives in more
        detail
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a cost plan/timeline for implementation activities over the next 12 months
    </li>

    The IT Architecture Transition Considerations deliverable assembles the work product outputs into a format, which is
    suitable for the client. The format typically includes two parts:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Specific entries in a database or web application – as defined and agreed as part of the Architecture Delivery
        Environment – see the Architecture Management DCD for further details
    </li>
    <li>
        Presentation material, which summarizes the findings of the Gap Analysis and Transition definition activities for
        use with briefing executives and stakeholders alike
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The content of the deliverable and its (associated) presentation material is used to educate and inform key client
    stakeholders of the outcomes from the Transition Considerations phase. This is to ensure that they are sufficiently
    knowledgeable, motivated, support and see business value in the transition recommendations and any associated business
    funding required.
</p>
<p>
    Whilst some key client executives and stakeholders may have been involved in developing the content of this
    deliverable, for most this will be the first time they have seen all the material summarized in a way, which provides
    them with a clear perspective of the transition options and implications of what they are aiming to achieve.
</p>
<p>
    Combine the work product inputs/outputs as follows using the following structure and guidance:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use ENG 107 and ENG 315 to provide an overview of the overall scope, objectives and deliverables of the engagement
        and remind key stakeholders of the value of these activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarize the contents of deliverables from previous phases of the IT Architecture – Quickstart engagement model,
        for example the IT Architecture Context DCD, the IT Architecture DCD and the Architecture Management DCD. Use this
        summary to highlight the major issues and key insights, which the engagement activities have already given.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the outputs from ARC 004 Infrastructure Gap Analysis, ARC 302 Application Function Model, ARC 306 Data Stores,
        ARC 308 Enterprise Technology Framework, ARC 309 Principles, Policies and Guidelines and ARC 312 Architecture
        Management Framework to:

    </li>
    <li>
        Show the combined list of BUS 005 Critical Issues, Opportunities and Recommendations, and how they have been
        rationalized. Focus on the key issues which have been incorporated into transition initiatives – these are the ones
        that you want executive management to recognize, relate too and understand. None of these should be a surprise as
        most, except those identified during gap analysis activities, will have been seen in previous executive level
        presentations BUS 321 Executive Briefing Package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the outputs from ORG 305 Transition Initiatives to show how the identified issues and transition requirements
        can be effectively combined into a few key initiatives that have business benefit. The deliverable should document
        each of these transition initiatives to a level/format, which shows the detail available behind the summary
        information/foils.
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstrate how the outputs from BUS 318 Capability Model, BUS 319 Capability Scenario and BUS 323 Strategic
        Direction have been used to prioritize the Transition Initiatives and to define the various transition scenarios
        captured in ORG 306 Transition Management Strategy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use all the above inputs as necessary to justify, from both a business and IT perspective, the recommendations made
        in ORG 306 Transition Strategy – the objective is for the business benefits to be clearly articulated and seen, so
        executive management can make conscious decisions, based on all the facts now available to them. Remember, the
        business won’t stop making decisions whilst these architecture engagements are in progress, but you will want to
        help influence as many as you can, based on the additional insights obtained.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarize the results and detailed content of this deliverable in BUS 321 Executive Briefing Package, ready for
        presentation to senior executives and key stakeholders.
