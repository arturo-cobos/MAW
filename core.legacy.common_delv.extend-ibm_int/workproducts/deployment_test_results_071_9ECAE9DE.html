    The Deployment Tests Results deliverable provides a means to verify proper execution of the software including
    interfaces with other applications and to gain client acceptance of the tested solution release.&nbsp; Additionally, it
    verifies the security of the solution.
</p>
<p>
    This deliverable documents the results of the following actions as pertain to the scope of a specific release for a
    solution.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Execution of the test cases defined to be conducted in the Deployment phase for a solution release’s Build
        verifying the solution’s system interfaces and interactions are functionally correct and operationally sound,
        ensure the solution created is secured, refining the goals for future release Builds based on identified errors,
        and documenting testing results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluation of the development and testing results conducted in the Build Cycle phase for the release’s completed
        Build along with adjustments and refinements to the goals and estimates for future solution release Builds, if
        needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Refinement of the specifications for acceptance testing based on feedback from the system and integration tests
        conducted for the release during the Build Cycle phase.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assisting the client’s staff identified to perform and participate in executing the defined test cases for the test
        levels planned and conducted in the Deployment phase to verify that the system is functionally correct and
        operationally secure and sound.
    </li>
    <li>
        Definition and management of the problem reporting process for acceptance testing.&nbsp; This includes defining and
        communicating the process for reporting errors, tracking all errors reported by the users during the acceptance
        testing, correcting errors, and notifying the users when the errors have been corrected.
    </li>
    <li>
        Definition and management of the problem reporting process for penetration testing.&nbsp; This includes defining
        and communicating the process for reporting security holes, status tracking of fixing these holes, correcting them,
        and notifying the client when they have been corrected.
    </li>
    <li>
        Documenting the results obtained for all tests conducted.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The tested solution release is deemed acceptable for client receipt provided Acceptance Test results fall within the
    criteria and tolerances specified in the Acceptance Test Plan.<br />

    The following work products contribute to the various deliverable topics or sections.
</p>
<p>
    The testing specifications work products identified for each testing level are fully defined at a detailed level for a
    specific release during Micro Design. They may each be revised, as needed, during the Build Cycle and Deployment phases
    for a specific release. Modifications may also be made while developing one release that may apply to the solution as a
    whole or to its future releases.
</p>
<p>
    Some work products may also contain detailed descriptions of prior solution releases and high-level descriptions for
    future solution releases that are discrete to those releases and not pertinent to the release undergoing the Deployment
    phase. Such work products will be iterated and more fully developed in later phases of the engagement as the need for
    greater detail is identified and required per each solution release. In this regard, work products input to this
    deliverable may be extensions and/or revisions to previously generated work products while others may be separate and
    distinct instances specific to this project and/or phase.

<p>
    The concept of completeness of a work product instance depends largely on whether the work product will be finished in
    this phase of the project or iterated for additional work in later phases. If the work product is to be iterated later,
    it will only be partially complete at the end of this phase. Regardless of whether each work product instance is fully
    or partially completed at this time, the content of the work products should be fully included in the deliverable being
    produced.
