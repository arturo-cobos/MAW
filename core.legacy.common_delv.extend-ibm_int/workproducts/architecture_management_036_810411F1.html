    The Architecture Management deliverable is used to document how changes to the desired business and IT environment will
    be implemented, managed and updated in response to changes in business needs and available technologies.
</p>
<p>
    The content of this deliverable is used in several different ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In organizations where the outsourcing of certain capabilities is being considered, this deliverable will provide a
        direct input to the documentation of partner responsibilities, roles and interface requirements. It will also
        heavily influence the definition of joint architecture management processes and responsibilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides a complete framework of processes to manage and evolve both enterprise and solution-level architectures,
        iteratively, over-time, as further levels of detail are defined during solution design and implementation
        activities. This includes processes, which all business, application development and IT operations staff will need
        to use, conform to and implement. It also includes processes to manage and evolve the chosen set of one or more
        ‘reference architectures’, which provide known, proven ‘default’ patterns for the design and implementation of
        business systems, application systems, packages and their associated infrastructure. These reference architectures
        drastically improve the opportunities for implementing rationalized architectural components and the architecture
        management framework provides processes for their effective reuse and promotion within the IT organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        As a framework for documenting and managing the key resources (process, information/knowledge, organization and
        technology) required to implement the desired business model and its associated capabilities. The detailing of
        these component resources will take place over time, as various business, architectural and organization
        projects/activities are undertaken. The deliverables from these engagements will be documented in a component of
        this Architecture Management DCD called an ‘Architecture Delivery Environment’ (Note; that the name of this
        deliverable will change, dependant on client focus and preferred nomenclature), which will be accessible to all
        business and IT stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides a central source of rules and guidelines for how the various resources in general and the architectures in
        particular, will be used and implemented in practice.

    This DCD is produced either as an output from phase 6 of the Business Architecture - Quickstart engagement model, or
    phase 4 of the IT Architecture - Quickstart engagement model. The content of this deliverable should include:

    The above description and purpose statements provide a summary of suitable words for inclusion in any client documents.
    The rest of this section contains additional wording, which may be of use in proposals, etc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> An Architecture Management deliverable documents how changes to the desired business and
    IT environment will be implemented, managed and updated in response to changes in business needs and available
    technologies. Experience has shown that most architectures fail, due to the lack of a robust architecture management
    framework. Without a proper set of management processes, and agreed roles and responsibilities, any architecture will
    become simply a set of reports and recommendations gathering dust on a shelf. Implementing and managing new roles,
    responsibilities and management processes is not easy, especially when they challenge ingrained management and cultural
    styles.
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of CSF’s to implementing effective architectures:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Sponsorship of the architecture - must be at the correct level in the organization. Experience has shown that the
        minimum should be a Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Finance Officer (CFO) or Chief Executive. The sponsor
        must be in a position to ensure all business and IT users are motivated to conform to the architecture and will
        contribute positively to its successful implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stakeholders and participants who come from both business areas and IT – must come from all parts of the company,
        not just the strategists – this includes business users, application development and service delivery. Many
        architectures fail because of a lack of direct line management involvement and responsibility.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clear ownership of the architectures – someone who will drive the definition and implementation of these
        enterprise-level architectures and who will leave a ‘successful, living legacy’ behind them when they move on –
        which they always do!
    </li>
    <li>
        Clearly defined processes, roles and responsibilities to manage these enterprise-level architectures as they grow,
        evolve and change (to reflect changes in both the business requirements and advances in technology). This includes
        processes for review, change, conformance, deviation and communication of the content of the architectures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Skilled senior support staff – people with a broad skill base, with no technology bias, who are highly respected
        across the organization and have good communications skills. These are the individuals who will form the core
        architecture team and work directly with development teams helping future solutions and systems to conform to and
        implement the chosen architectures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Easy access to the content of these enterprise-level architectures and the dissemination of information – document
        in a tool or delivery environment which is easy to access and maintain, for example, as a Lotus Notes database, or
        HTML pages on a company-wide intranet. All business and IT users must have a positive reason to use the information
        available.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clear communication of the content to both business and IT users and stakeholders – as the architectures are
        defined, clear, concise models will be key to getting acceptance, and business investment to ensure the they are
        implemented and managed on an ongoing basis. Visibility drives culture and organizational change.
    </li>
    <li>
        When companies decide to outsource all or part of an IT organization, particularly application development or
        service delivery, the impact of these CSFs is multiplied.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The deliverable would normally include the following:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Architecture Management principles (optional) if appropriate· Defined and agreed Architecture Management processes,
        integrated into the business, IT planning and procurement cycles
    </li>
    <li>
        Defined and agreed Architecture Management roles and responsibilities
    </li>
    <li>
        An overview of the Architecture Delivery Environment within which the contents of these enterprise-level
        architectures will be maintained
    </li>
    <li>
        List of any architecture management initiatives including a more detailed definition of appropriate processes,
        roles and responsibilities – part of the Business Architecture Transition Considerations DCD
    </li>
    <li>
        Architecture Management transition issues (may be captured as part of Critical Issues, Opportunities and
        Recommendations WP) – part of the Business Architecture Transition Considerations DCD<br />

    The Architecture Management deliverable assembles the work product outputs into a format, which is suitable for the
    client. The format typically includes three parts:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        The Architecture Delivery Environment – provides a complete environment (Notes database, web application, or
        external tool) for capturing and disseminating all the deliverables and outputs produced from one or more
        engagements, or internal client projects.
    </li>
    <li>
        The architecture management processes, roles and responsibilities components, stored in the Architecture Delivery
        Environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Presentation material, which summarizes the content of each of the component parts and the structure, benefits and
        objectives of the Architecture Management DCD.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
    The content of the deliverable and its (associated) presentation material is used to educate and inform all client
    business and IT stakeholders and users of:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        The detailed outputs which have been produced, both in the course of this engagement and other associated projects.
    </li>
    <li>
        The processes, roles and responsibilities involved in managing the architectures over time, as individual solutions
        are designed and implemented and further levels of detail are added
    </li>
    <li>
        The structure of the database/web application which holds the outputs, how it is used and how to access the
        information it contains
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In practice, key business users and IT stakeholders will have been involved in defining requirements for the
    architecture delivery environment and will have provided feedback as it develops. In addition, some key stakeholders
    will have been involved in defining and agreeing the new processes, roles and responsibilities captured in the
    Architecture Management Framework.
</p>
<p>
    Combine the work product inputs/outputs as follows using the following structure and guidance:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Use ENG 315 to provide an overview of the overall scope, objectives and deliverables of the engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a summary of the Business Architecture Context, IT Architecture Context, Business Architecture, Application
        Architecture and IT Architecture DCDs previously produced, to remind stakeholders of the work that has been
        completed so far. Confirm their understanding of what the enterprise is and aspires to become, how it intends to
        achieve its goals and make the desired transition, and by what means.
    </li>
    <li>
        Show how the ARC 309 Principles, Policies and Guidelines have been incorporated into the Architecture Management
        Framework and will directly underpin how these assets are used and evolved over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a summary of the ARC 312 Architecture Management Framework and ORG 006 Future Organization Design outputs, to
        highlight the new processes, roles and responsibilities, which have been defined and how these will be implemented
        across the organization structure. Organizational and process changes always take a long time to assimilate
        effectively, and the sooner you can get senior management support for the changes which have been agreed, the
        sooner the new management framework can be effectively implemented.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the Architecture Delivery Environment, which has been defined and implemented as part of this engagement, to
        demonstrate the contents, usability, access and benefits of the technical environment, which has been established
        (originally defined in ENG 359 Technical Environment Inventory).
    </li>
    <li>
        In particular, stress how this deliverable will support the business goals - remind key stakeholders of the value
        of these activities and the benefits of providing/implementing a governance framework, which will evolve over time
        as business and IT requirements evolve and change.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use BUS 005 Critical Issues, Opportunities and Recommendations to highlight any major issues, which have become
        apparent during these architecture management activities. Highlight any assumptions made which need to be validated
        by senior business and IT executives, or any key observations/insights which are already apparent and which senior
        management need to start considering, in their day-to-day business management/decision making activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarize the results and detailed content of this deliverable in BUS 321 Executive Briefing Package, ready for
        presentation to senior executives and key stakeholders.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The inputs used to provide the component parts of this Architecture Management deliverable include:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Outputs from phase 3 of either the Business Architecture – Quickstart engagement model, or the IT Architecture –
        Quickstart engagement model, specifically the Initiate Business Architecture/Initiate IT Architecture activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        General knowledge and awareness of the outputs from previous phases, which could include the contents of the
        Business Architecture Context DCD, the Business Architecture DCD, the Application Architecture DCD, IT Architecture
        Context DCD and the IT Architecture DCD. Note that the activities and tasks that produce this deliverable are run
        in parallel with other phases in the engagement model (s.)
