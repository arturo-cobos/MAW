    Integrating the Practice with a Delivery Process
</h3>
<p>
    The Systems Engineering practice focuses on the six technical baselines that are created. The six baselines are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customer Baseline&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            System Baseline&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Component Baseline&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Design Baseline&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Test Baseline&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Production Baseline
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When integrating the Systems Engineering practice with delivery processes, the first step is to determine which
    baselines are applicable to the project. Some baselines may be not needed; for example, the Test Baseline may not be
    applicable if the project does not include a system, integration, performance, or acceptance test that is separate from
    the component test. An example of such a project could be a minor functional upgrade to a single application. Other
    baselines may be combined due to schedule issues and/or lack of system complexity. In all cases, it is important to
    verify that the necessary baseline information is captured in some form.
</p><br /><p/><p>
    &nbsp;These baselines are shown in the figure below. Baseline details and tailoring guidelines are also provided.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<a href="./../../../practice.tech.sys_eng.extend-ibm_int/guidances/roadmaps/resources/integrating_the_systems_eng_cap_pattern_img.JPG"><img height="611"     alt="System Engineering Roadmap" src="./../../../practice.tech.sys_eng.extend-ibm_int/guidances/roadmaps/resources/integrating_the_systems_eng_cap_pattern_img.JPG" width="700" /></a>
</p>
<p>
    Of the six baselines, three of them are created by the Systems Engineering team or the customer to provide the
    technical solution details to the development, test and Service Management teams. These baselines provide the business,
    system, and component requirements for the project. These baselines are 1) the Customer Baseline, 2) the System
    Baseline, and 3) the Component Baseline. As shown in the figure below, these baselines provide the development, test,
    and service management teams with the requirements to enable the teams to effectively build and test the system. Also,
    the project’s technical baseline has been defined such that the project manager can effectively manage the project.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<img style="WIDTH: 735px; HEIGHT: 611px" height="562" alt=""     src="./../../../practice.tech.sys_eng.extend-ibm_int/guidances/roadmaps/resources/integrating_the_systems_eng_cap_pattern_img3.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    The other three baselines, the Design Baseline, the Test Baseline, and the Production Baseline, are created by the
    development organizations, the test organizations, and project manager. These baselines describe how these
    organizations will implement (or have implemented) the requirements that were created by the first three baselines.
</p>
<p>
    As with all practices, there are external inputs (work products) to the practice that must be provided from the base
    delivery process or other practices and there are work products and deliverables that are created by this practice that
    will be used as inputs to the base delivery process and other practices. When integrating the Systems Engineering
    practice with a delivery process, it is vital to make sure that the inputs and outputs between the practice and the
    delivery process are in synch. While it is optimal if the input/output work products and deliverables exactly match,
    this is not essential. It is essential that the necessary information within the input work product is created by the
    output work product; it is not essential that the exact work product is provided as input. Thus, when there is a
    ‘mismatch’ of input / output work products between the practice and the delivery process, the practitioner must
    determine whether the information needed as input (by the practice or the delivery process) is actually provided by
    another work project that is output (by either the delivery process or practice).
</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
    Tailoring the Practice
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    T<a>ailoring involves determining the particular needs of each work effort and ensuring that the activities are
    performed at the level necessary to ensure quality work is performed, while meeting the needs of the particular work
    effort. The size and complexity of the project, along with other factors considered for each project and each customer
    help to determine the appropriate tailoring when creating the project's defined software process. The baselines may be
    tailored when processes, documents, and reviews are held external to the practice that replaces the baseline created
    within the&nbsp;practice.</a>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Note: When combining reviews/baselines or tailoring a baseline out of the practice, ensure that all components of all
    reviews are incorporated into the reviews that are held for the project. Standard review items may only be excluded if
    not applicable to the project; they should not be excluded based on a particular standalone review not being held. The
    practice may be tailored in several ways:
</p>
<ol dir="ltr">
    <li>
        <div>
            Tailor individual work products to be produced
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Tailor individual activities or tasks to be performed
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Tailor baselines defined
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    When tailoring individual work products to be produced by the practice, the practitioner must verify that either the
    work product is not needed by the project or that the relevant work product information is being provided by another
    work product within the practice or within the overall delivery process.
</p>
<p>
    When tailoring individual activities of tasks to be performed by the practice, the practitioner must verify that the
    activities/tasks and the work products created by the tailored activities/tasks are not needed by the project or that
    the activities/tasks and the work products created by the tailored activities/tasks are replaced by other
    activities/tasks/work products. Since work products created by one activity/task are used in subsequent
    activities/tasks, the practitioner must verify that the necessary information is created within some project task.
</p>
<p>
    When tailoring the technical baselines of the practice, the practitioner must verify that the outputs of the baselines
    are created by some other project activities. The output of one baseline is used as inputs to the subsequent baselines.
    This provides the traceability from customer needs through system design, system test, acceptance test, and the
    delivered system.
</p>
<p>
    The following examples show tailoring that can be performed to the capability pattern and reasons for the tailoring.
    There may be other tailoring reasons for specific projects.
</p>
<h4>
    Combining the BRR and the SRR
</h4>
<p>
    If the Business Requirements Review (BRR) is held, then the customer business requirements are reviewed at the BRR, and
    any changes to the requirements baseline since the BRR will be reviewed at the System Requirements Review (SRR).
</p>
<p>
    If the Business Requirements Review (BRR) is <b>not</b> held, the customer business requirements are reviewed and
    approved as part of the System Requirements Review (SRR). The customer business requirements are listed and traced to
    the system requirements in the SRR. The SRR template provides guidance on how the gathered requirements are defined and
    reviewed.
</p>
<p>
    Customer business requirements and system requirements are typically two different sets of requirements, but may be one
    set of requirements if the customer provides system-level requirements or if the project is small or not complex.
</p>
<h4>
    Combining the PDR with the SRR and/or the CDR
</h4>
<p>
    The PDR may be excluded and its material covered within the project’s SRR and CDR. When the PDR is excluded, the
    project’s requirements are completely defined in the SRR and the design is completely defined in the CDR. Reasons for
    conducting the reviews this way include:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        No separate component requirements baseline is necessary because the project is not complex, the system
        requirements are equal to the component requirements and no further decomposition is needed (for example, the
        system requirements are all allocated to a single component, application or module, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The customer provides requirements at the component level. In this case, the component requirements are already
            defined when they are received from the customer. Validation of these customer requirements is done and is
            already at the component level.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The project is small and is not complex.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    There may be other reasons to combine these reviews for a specific project.
</p>
<p>
    System and component requirements may be one set of requirements if the project encompasses only one component or
    application, and the project team decides not to allocate requirements to a lower level than the application. In this
    case, the system requirements are all allocated to a single component, and the system requirements are equal to the
    component requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the project size, scope, and team structure, the system requirements document may be updated with
    component requirements or a separate component requirement document may be created. If the requirements are combined in
    a single document, then a ‘Consolidated Requirements Document’ is created that contains all requirements rather than
    having a separate System Requirements Specification and separate Component Requirements Specification(s). If a
    ‘Consolidated Requirements Document’ is created, then the project team should consider adding the business requirements
    to the document in order to consolidate all levels of requirements into a single document.
</p>
<h4>
    Combining the TRR and the PRR
</h4>
<p>
    If there is not a separate Systems Integration Test (e.g., in small projects all testing may be performed by the
    development teams), then the TRR may be skipped and the relevant TRR information is reviewed at the PRR. For example,
    the PRR would review the development test results rather than the Systems Integration Test results.
