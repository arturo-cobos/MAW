    The component model describes the structure of a system in terms of its software components with their
    responsibilities, interfaces, relationships, and the way they collaborate to deliver the required functionality. The
    component model is the main artifact documenting the functional view of the architecture and serves as an abstraction
    of the design. Components identified may be decomposed into further component models before they complete the
    specification required for detailed design.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Component models help define and document:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The structure of the system
    </li>
    <li>
        The recurring interactions and dependencies between sets of components
    </li>
    <li>
        The components present within an enterprise, each of which may be made up of smaller components.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Component models are documented at 2 levels:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The logical level - focuses on specifying the components' responsibilities and characteristics required to deliver
        the requirements. These specifications are technology and product neutral.
    </li>
    <li>
        The physical level -focuses on how to implement the components to meet the previously established specifications.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You may transform logical components into physical components via custom development, the purchase of products, or the
    reuse of assets.<br />
</p>
<p>
    It may be important to maintain a separation between logical and physical components on larger projects. However,
    smaller or less complex projects may evolve a single logical component model into a physical model, and end up with
    only a physical model.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Examples of components at the logical level are a 'Message Bus' or a 'Customer Relationship Manager' component.
    Components at the physical level that implement these logical components might be 'IBM WebSphere Message Broker' or
    'Siebel Contact Center.'<br />
</p><p/><p>
    The Subsystem sits at the transition point between business and IT aspects. Subsystem analysis validates and completes
    the mapping of high level business functions to high level IT functions that started during Functional Area
    Analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Subsystem represents a large-grained organizing&nbsp;construct that provides logical grouping of
    functions and functionally-cohesive, business aligned services.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    During this process of elaboration, mapping is taken from the subsystem level down to the service component
    level.&nbsp; Service components identified during Subsystem Analysis are elaborated and specified during Component
    Specification. Service Components are initially associated with subsystems that are functionally aligned with business
    domain functional areas. This relationship provides traceability and justification for their inclusion in the solution.
</p>
<p>
    A Service Component is a large grained unit that acts as a container of functionality provided by functional and
    technical components. A characteristic of Service Components is the use of several key design patterns: fa√ßade,
    composite, mediator and rule objects.
</p>
<p>
    Services used in an SOA based solution are realized through Service Components which belong to a specific business
    function aligned subsystem. Each Service Component will have the responsibility of ensuring the QoS of the services it
    will realize. As an enterprise-scale asset, each Service Component qualifies for funding, governance and maintenance
    associated with it. Infrastructure management must be in place to ensure availability, load balancing, security,
    performance, versioning and overall health of the Service Component that will be responsible for implementing the
    functionality of a set of services and ensuring its quality of service. Functional components and technical components
    can be used across several Service Components.
</p>
<p>
    In an SOA project, this artifact progresses through a more detailed elaboration of the model that originated with the
    subsystem analysis. Key differentiating aspects of the service Component Model are the use of the Enterprise Component
    pattern in the elaboration of Service, Functional and Technical Components, and a technique that focuses on concise
    modeling at the component level.

<div class="sectionContent">
<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Points to consider when deciding whether to use a Component Model:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A Component Model is useful when you must design the system for multiple target environments, with separate design
        architectures. The Component Model is an abstraction, or a generalization, of the system design. It omits most of
        the details of the design in order to provide an overview of the system's functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Component Model provides value when the design is complex, such that new team members need a simplified,
        abstracted model to understand it. A well-defined architecture can serve the same purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
        Balance the extra work required to ensure that the component and design models remain consistent against the
        benefit of having a view of the system that represents only the most important details of how the system works. It
        can be very costly to maintain a high degree of fidelity between the Component Model and the system design. A less
        ambitious approach might be to maintain the Component Model with only the most important components and the key
        abstractions in the design. As the complexity of the Component Model increases, so does the cost to maintain it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you no longer maintain the Component Model, its value decays rapidly. At some point, it no longer accurately
        reflects the current functional design of the system. Deciding to no longer maintain the Component Model may be
        appropriate, as it may have served its purpose, but the decision should be a conscious one.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Component models tend to be useful in companies where systems live for decades, or where there are many variants of the
    system.<br />
</p>
<p>
    To ensure the successful development of a component model on a project, your team should:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Create a stable and coherent structure
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus on the right levels of abstraction
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop relationship and interaction diagrams in parallel
    </li>
    <li>
        Select architecturally significant requirements as inputs to the Component Model
    </li>
    <li>
        Plan how your team will leverage the Component Model throughout the project lifecycle
    </li>
</ul><p/><h5>
    Create a Stable and Coherent Structure
</h5>
<p>
    The main purpose of a component model is to create a stable and coherent structure for the design level activities so
    that a seamless integration of the design level artifacts can be achieved.&nbsp; However, the responsibilities of and
    relationships between components are very dependent on the scope of the IT System for which the component model is
    built.&nbsp; The broader the scope, the more the responsibilities of the components have been factored out (and the
    more components have been defined).&nbsp; To avoid having to restructure the component model, a sufficiently broad
    scope needs to be defined before starting the drive out the required components. This scope can initially be defined
    broader than the one for which the system is being developed, this to ensure that all functionality (even the future
    one) will have been factored out properly.&nbsp; Also by engineering the component model for low coupling, the
    likelihood of their being many impacts as a result from changes, will be reduced.
</p>
<h5>
    Pay Attention to the Level of Abstraction
</h5>
<p>
    The biggest challenge in creating the component model is to find the right level of abstraction.&nbsp; A very abstract
    model could potentially express everything, but is of little value in a concrete situation, while an extremely detailed
    treatment of the problems would be overwhelming to work through and would not help in establishing the overall
    structure of the system.&nbsp; The model should express the main structure and characteristics of the system both at a
    technical and an application level.
</p>
<h5>
    Leverage the Component Model
</h5>
<p>
    Once properly specified, a component can be treated as a self-contained system and can be put to different uses:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        as a unit of work allocation to a development group.
    </li>
    <li>
        as a unit for version and release control purposes
    </li>
    <li>
        as a scope for testing at an intermediate level in between unit and system integration level testing
    </li>
    <li>
        as a measure for project progress
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Develop the Interaction Diagrams and the Component Relationship Diagram in Parallel
</h5>
<p>
    The best results are obtained starting from the architecturally significant use cases and deriving the component
    interaction diagrams which implement them. Such an approach gives a much better feel for the way the component
    responsibilities are factored out across the identified components. Also, the component relationship diagram can be
    easily derived from this (limited) set of component interaction diagrams.
</p>
<h5>
    Select Architecturally Significant Use Cases
</h5>
<p>
    Focus on those use cases that require either system-wide mechanisms or illustrate key (application level)
    functionality.&nbsp; The key objective is to drive out component responsibilities and specifications which in turn give
    us a clear understanding of how the system will support the requirements. Working through all use cases would not
    deliver an increased insight into the system, at least if the selection of the architecturally significant use cases
    has been performed properly, and is, from a practical point of view, unfeasible any way.&nbsp;&nbsp;
