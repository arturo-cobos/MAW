<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    A Method Adoption Workshop (MAW) is the approach used to customize the delivery process, to select work products and to
    establish the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to meet the requirements of a specific project. We use the term
    "adoption", to suggest the process of "adopting" or determining the components of the method to be used for a specific
    circumstance. The guidance on conducting a Method Adoption Workshop is not intended as a rigid set of rules, but rather
    a flexible set of guidelines and recommendations. This approach allows you to determine the requirements of your
    specific client circumstance and tailor the Method to define the scope and approach of the solution to be proposed and
    implemented.
</p>
<p>
    The Method Adoption Workshop will familiarize the project team with the method, tailor the method to the needs of the
    project and contributes to the understanding and expertise on the use of methods by the project team. The Method
    Adoption Workshop will establish the base delivery process to be used, the set of work products that will be produced
    by the project, the WBS and an initial project plan, an initial resource plan and initial project risk assessment.
</p>
<p>
    Two events typically drive the need for a Method Adoption Workshop, a proposal and initiating a phase of an project.
    When the purpose of the Method Adoption Workshop is to formulate a response to a request for proposal, we refer to the
    activity as a Proposal Method Adoption Workshop. There are no major differences in the framework or facilitation of a
    Proposal Method Adoption Workshop and a Method Adoption Workshop other than the timing and purpose for which it occurs.
</p>
<p>
    A Method Adoption Workshop can range from half a day to five days in duration, and is typically two to four days. The
    size, risk level, complexity of the proposal/project, along with the skills and expertise of the delivery team, will
    determine the duration and requirements for a Method Adoption Workshop. In some instances, the Method Adoption Workshop
    may be completed via teleconference if it meets the requirements of the&nbsp;requesting organization and the
    delivery&nbsp;team.
</p>
<h3>
    Objectives and Results
</h3>
<p>
    The Method Adoption Workshop is the keystone of method deployment and requires preparation, education, leadership and
    follow-on mentoring.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Objectives of a Method Adoption Workshop include:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understand the proposal/project
    </li>
    <li>
        Tailor the method to meet the proposal/project requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select techniques and tools to be used on the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assess Risks
    </li>
    <li>
        Assess project team skills and readiness to deliver
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Expected results from a Method Adoption Workshop include:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A tailored method via a defined delivery process that will be used to deliver the project　　
    </li>
    <li>
        Work products to be produced for the project
    </li>
    <li>
        Work Breakdown Structure and initial project plan
    </li>
    <li>
        A project team that understands the method to be used
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Participants
</h3>
<p>
    Participants involved with a Method Adoption Workshop will vary and is determined by the requirements, purpose and
    timing of the workshop. For example, a Method Adoption Workshop should be conducted at Solution Design (proposal) and
    again at the beginning of each phase of the project, although for later phases this may be just a quick validation. The
    proposal team may be a different group than the delivery team, however, for some key roles (such as Project Manager,
    Architect or Method Champion), the same persons should be involved for both MAW instances.
</p>
<p>
    Most commonly the Method Adoption Workshop is for the delivery team, but as appropriate a Method Adoption Workshop may
    also include customers. The results and output of a Method Adoption Workshop should always be reviewed with the
    sponsor.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A typical list of attendees to the MAW may include, but is not limited to:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Proposal Team Leader
    </li>
    <li>
        Project Manager
    </li>
    <li>
        Architect
    </li>
    <li>
        Team Leads
    </li>
    <li>
        Subject Matter Experts
    </li>
    <li>
        Method Champions
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Typical customer participants may include, but is not limited to:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project Sponsor
    </li>
    <li>
        Project Manager
    </li>
    <li>
        Project Team Members
    </li>
    <li>
        Key Stake Holders
    </li>
    <li>
        Key Users
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Consideration to the size, expertise and decision-making ability for the group should be given. Too large a group may
    inhibit effective decision-making. Attendees without decision-making authority or expertise may also impact overall
    success of the workshop. If specific expertise is expected in the adoption of the Method to the specific circumstances,
    appropriate resources should be included in the Method Adoption Workshop. For example, if a large content of Business
    Transformation and Change is anticipated and that knowledge does not reside in the proposal/project team, appropriate
    resources should be included in the Method Adoption Workshop and considered as mentors to the project.
</p>
<p>
    Participants should be knowledgeable with the method and work products, understand the business goals and scope of work
    of the project and be familiar with the support tools to be used.
</p>
<h3>
    Key Roles and Responsibilities
</h3>
<p>
    Results and overall success of a Method Adoption Workshop are determined through the contributions and commitment of
    each of the participants. To help maximize results, there are three primary roles to fulfill for a Method Adoption
    Workshop. They are:
</p>
<h4>
    Method Champion
</h4>
<p>
    A Method Champion has expertise and experience with the Method. A Method Champion is a role, not a profession. A Method
    Champion role is responsible for promoting understanding of the Unified Method Framework, leading and facilitating
    Method Adoption Workshops, mentoring delivery teams on the use of the method during a project, reviewing work products
    harvested from projects and harvesting "best of breed" experience.
</p>
<p>
    The skill guideline for a Method Champion is a senior level practitioner with expertise in using the method developed
    through formal education, self-study and practical experience. Most often, a Method Champion has a high level of
    proficiency with the method for which they are a champion, working knowledge of the core method and working knowledge
    of the tools used with to support the method.
</p>
<p>
    The Method Champion facilitates the Method Adoption Workshop and may be a member of the project team, or a mentor to
    the project team. The Method Champion is responsible to work with the Proposal Manager and/or Project Manager to plan
    and prepare for the Method Adoption Workshop, as well as facilitate the Workshop. A Method Champion may continue beyond
    the Method Adoption Workshop as a project team member or as a mentor to the project team.
</p>
<h4>
    Project Manager
</h4>
<p>
    The Project Manager is responsible to work with the Method Champion to set clear objectives for the Method Adoption
    Workshop, identify scope issues and delivery issues, risks, cost strategies and other delivery issuses. The Method
    Adoption Workshop is not intended to resolve all issues, it is an opportunity to identify and establish an initial
    strategy with the team using the method. The project manager remains responsible for the delivery of the project, day
    to day direction for the delivery team, project management and project administration.
</p>
<p>
    It is beneficial to the success of the Method Adoption Workshop to have a dedicated resource capturing decisions and
    documenting outcomes throughout the workshop.
</p>
<h3>
    Agenda
</h3>
<p>
    The Method Adoption Workshop is a framework that allows you to adopt the method to meet your specific project
    circumstances using an efficient and effective process. There is no single way to conduct a Method Adoption Workshop.
    The agenda, duration and content of the Method Adoption Workshop can and should be tailored to meet your specific
    circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    It is recommended that you begin the MAW with an overview of the Method Adoption Workshop process, an overview of the
    project/proposal, the business goals and business problem to be solved, budgets and schedules for the project, and an
    overview and education on the method as required.
</p>
<p>
    A typical agenda could include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Method Adoption Workshop Overview, Objectives and Expected Results
    </li>
    <li>
        Overview of Proposal/Project, Project Circumstances, Environment, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Overview of the Method
    </li>
    <li>
        Tailoring the Method to the Project 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Delivery process selection/verification
            </li>
            <li>
                Practice selection/verification
            </li>
            <li>
                Work product selection/verification
            </li>
            <li>
                Completion criteria
            </li>
            <li>
                Updating the Work Breakdown Structure
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop the Initial Project Plan including estimates, resources and milestones
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk identification and analysis
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Preparing for the Method Adoption Workshop
</h3>
<p>
    To maximize results and duration of a Method Adoption Workshop, several activities can be completed with a smaller
    group of participants prior to the MAW. These activities could include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Determining the delivery process that most closely matches the project circumstances and document your decision to
        be reviewed with the team in the MAW Overview. To do this, follow the steps in the "Basic Tailoring Procedure"
        section.
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing the participants prerequisite materials for review prior to the Method Adoption Workshop. Examples would
        include an RFP, Agreement, Project Charter, and any relevant documents that would help the team prepare for the
        workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
        Completing a preliminary risk assessment for review and validation during the workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessing the knowledge and expertise of the planned attendees to ensure appropriate expertise to meet the
        requirements. Invite additional participants with special skills as required to ensure expected results at the
        completion of the Method Adoption Workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing as much advance notice as possible to requested participants to maximize attendance.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Completing logistical planning to contribute to the overall success of the workshop, this includes consideration to
    location (onsite or offsite), technology requirements for the workshop, including recommendations to participants as to
    what to have loaded on their laptops, etc.
</p>
<h3>
    Conducting the Method Adoption Workshop
</h3>
<h4>
    Method Adoption Workshop Overview, Objectives and Expected Results
</h4>
<p>
    These are the goals to be achieved during and after the workshop and well as a brief overview of how the MAW will be
    conducted.
</p>
<h4>
    Overview of Proposal/Project, Client Circumstances, Environment and Politics
</h4>
<p>
    The Project/Proposal Manager describes the scope and objectives of the project or proposal and its characteristics,
    setting out what is to be achieved, any constraints, and any special features or resources that are needed.
</p>
<h4>
    Overview of Method
</h4>
<p>
    The Method Champion provides a brief tutorial on the Method (if needed), and then describes the benefits the Method
    will bring to the project.
</p>
<h4>
    Tailoring the Method to the Project
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Delivery process selection</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Establish a context for the tailoring work by comparison with existing delivery processes. The Method Champion proposes
    a delivery processes that will fit the project characteristics based on phase structure and the deliverables produced.
    This is discussed briefly, before acceptance or rejection. If rejected a counter-proposal must be made and accepted. If
    no single delivery process matches the project closely enough, then decide which process or processes are reasonably
    close and note the main ways in which the project differs.
</p>
<p>
    If there is no good match at all, then the available practices should be reviewed to see if they cover the required
    capabilities for the project, otherwise individual work products will need to be selected from the processes that match
    the different aspects of the project, see the section on tailoring "first of a kind" delivery processes.
</p>
<p>
    Agreement must be reached on the process to be used. The result is a few brief notes that provide the context for later
    work. For example we may decide that a project is similar to the Single Release delivery process except that the
    project has to do a more thorough job of usability.
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><strong>Practice selection</strong></font>
</p>
<p>
    Starting with the selected delivery process, determine if all the included practices are needed, if any alternatives
    exist that would be a better match for this project or there are gaps in the process that can be addressed by including
    additional practices.
</p>
<p>
    Swapping practices is fairly straightforward as this is often done when the technique from one practice is more
    suitable than another for this particular project. For example we may substitute User Story Driven Development for Use
    Case Driven Development based on how requirements will be developed.
</p>
<p>
    Practices may be added to a process when the overall lifecycle or phase structure fits the project, but the scope of
    work covered is insufficient. So in the case of the Single Release delivery process we may choose to add the User
    Experience practice to more thoroughly cover usability.
</p>
<p>
    When just removing practices, care should be taken that the capabilities provided by that practice are really not
    needed and to ensure that downstream activities still have the necessary inputs provided.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work Product&nbsp;selection</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For a Method Adoption Workshop held for a proposal, the list of work products is very short with the main focus being
    on what will be the deliverables. Later MAWs will focus on verifying these selections and adding any additional work
    products that are needed. For delivery processes that already have deliverables defined it is best to start with the
    deliverable and then look at what input artifacts are needed based on the deliverables selected. Even for some projects
    where deliverables are not defined in the delivery process, it is often wise to start with deliverables and work
    backwards to select the artifacts that fit them. For each work product decide whether it should be produced on the
    project, record the decision. Add any relevant qualifications about how detailed the work product has to be. For
    example, it may be that a given work product should be produced, but only in a lightweight version. Add any known
    information about the tools that should be used to create and edit the work product.
</p>
<p>
    Further tailoring at the work product level can be done as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Remove work products</em> -- With the dependency diagrams as a guide, work a domain at a time using RMC, the
        Method browser, or an delivery process spreadsheet, and remove work products that will not be produced. Document
        reasons in the Work Product List aftifact.　 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Beware that dependencies between work products may be across domains.　
            </li>
            <li>
                The sections of the work product called 'Impact of Not Having' and 'Reasons for Not Needing' give advice
                about omissions.　　
            </li>
            <li>
                Record the reasons for important omissions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Add work products</em> (if using spreadsheet) -- If the work product required is not be part of the delivery
        processl chosen, then this work product should be added into the appropriate domain in the chosen delivery process.
        Start by identifying the deliverables that need to be produced and examine the inputs for each deliverable
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                When reviewing additional work products to adopt it is often easier to work by domain
            </li>
            <li>
                Decisions can be determined domain by domain or phase by phase. If you want to take your Work Product
                choices following the Work Breakdown Structure, be aware of the risk that you will be tempted to define the
                "What" (i.e. Work Products) and the "How" (i.e. Work Breakdown Structure) at the same time. Defining the
                "What" and "How" this way is generally not a good idea, except for very small and overseeable projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Work with a complete list of standard work products and another list for each delivery process model that
                matches the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add any completely new work products that may be necessary or appropriate for the particular contractual,
                technical or other circumstances of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the lists for the closely matching delivery processes as a guide.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Modify work product dependencies</em> -- Where work products have been removed or added, modify the inputs and
        outputs in the delivery process, or (for presentation purposes) modify the dependency diagrams.
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For each work product identify the work products on which it principally depends.
            </li>
            <li>
                New work products are either contractual deliverables or have some impact on contractual deliverables.　
                Most are produced from (are impacted by) some other work products as input.　 The dependency diagram shows
                the impacts/depends on relationships.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove omitted work products from the diagram.　 For each omitted work product check that the
                impacts/depends on chains of relationships can be satisfactorily redefined in its absence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dependency diagrams give a good overview of the project. Create dependency diagrams for your project by
                adopting the existing dependency diagrams for each domain with your work product decisions for your
                circumstances.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Group work products into deliverables</em> -- If a deliverable has not been used as a starting point for
        tailoring or does not exist for the selected delivery process then it will be necessary to group the selected work
        products into deliverables or some other convenient grouping. Work products can also be grouped by phase, or
        domain, or phase and domain, or by recipient.
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <strong>Completion Criteria</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As the method is designed to be both iterative and incremental, criteria should be agreed to indicate when enough work
    has been done to complete a work product for the phase in which it is produced. Completion criteria for deliverables
    should be outlined in the Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Udating the Work Breakdown Structure</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Amend the work breakdown structure of a matching delivery process so that it matches the needs of the project. The
    result is the skeleton of a project plan produced by modifying the delivery process default.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Remove the tasks that produce the omitted work products.
    </li>
    <li>
        Amend the tasks that have omitted work products as inputs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add tasks to produce new work products or selected work products that were not part of the matching delivery
        process. In some cases it may be reasonable to amend existing tasks so that they produce the extra work products.
    </li>
    <li>
        Position the new tasks in the overall work breakdown structure. Use the dependency diagram as a guide to the main
        inputs and outputs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the phase and activity structure and amend if appropriate.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Develop the Initial Project Plan including estimates, resources and milestones
</h4>
<p>
    Ensure that the appropriate roles are responsible for the creation of each work product based on agreement with the
    different workstream leads. Check these assignments versus the roles performing the individual tasks.
</p>
<p>
    Produce an order of magnitude estimate covering the phases covered in the MAW.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure the required milestones are included in the WBS and create a draft project schedule. If RMC is being used
    this is done by exporting the tailored delivery process, however the resulting project schedule will still need some
    manual intervention.
</p>
<h4>
    Risk Identification and Analysis
</h4>
<p>
    Project risks should be identified (or updated) at this stage and some assessment made of their severity. A containment
    plan is produced at a later stage.
</p>
<h3>
    Tailoring "First of a Kind" Delivery Processes
</h3>
<p>
    This step is only necessary in the rare circumstance when a completely new work breakdown has to be built, because no
    delivery process is close enough to act as a base. Should this be required, you can either use the empty "starter"
    process or select another existing work breakdown structures as a guide.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Decide on the main phase-end checkpoints in the project. By considering how long the project is likely to last,
        decide on an approximate, reasonable number of intermediate, major checkpoints. Characterize each checkpoint by the
        questions that are asked at the review and by the decisions that are confirmed. Decide which phases need to be
        replicated on the project. Draw a simple phase diagram.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine what deliverables are produced in each phase or what the significant checkpoints/milestones in the
        project are.
    </li>
    <li>
        Locate any practices that provide the required capabilities to produce the identified deliverables. If using
        practices, add any required process slots to the basic phase structure to specify where particular types of
        activities will occur in the WBS.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make a phase-work product cross-reference for any missing work products, by deciding which additional work products
        are created or updated in each phase.
    </li>
    <li>
        Within each phase, decide on the significant internal review points,&nbsp;characterize each checkpoint by the
        questions that are asked at the review and by the decisions that are confirmed. The internal review points often
        correspond to activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Often it is convenient and accurate to have one or more activities for each significant area of work within the
        phase. Draw a simple activity diagram for each phase.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make an activity-work product cross-reference, by deciding which work products are created or updated in each
        activity.
    </li>
    <li>
        List the tasks in each activity. Identify the output work products for each task. Identify the input work products
        for each task.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Results of the Method Adoption Workshop
</h3>
<p>
    At the completion of the Method Adoption Workshop, the team should have the following items in order to begin work on
    the selected engagement:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A tailored Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) from an existing delivery process, this WBS will most likely exist in the
        RMC tool. Immediately after the MAW, this WBS should be moved to the scheduling tool. From this point,
        modifications to task duration, task dependencies, and actual task assignments can be made.
    </li>
    <li>
        A completed Work Product List, a template for this can be found with the corresponding artifact.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the type of MAW, either a preliminary Risk Assessment (if a Proposal MAW was conducted), or the full risk
    assessment if the MAW was conducted in support of the project.
</p>
<h3>
    Key Considerations&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    Professional judgment and expertise along with a clear understanding of the project circumstance are required to
    successfully adopt the method to the requirements. This section includes tips, techniques and recommendations to
    consider when adopting the method.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Replicable models and "best practices" do not guarantee success. In the midst of the method, do not lose track of
        the business problem to be solved and the specific circumstance being resolved for the customer. Tailor the method
        to meet the requirements of your project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review "Impact of not having" and "Reasons for not needing" sections of the artifacts to test the validity of your
        decisions and resulting impact to the tasks and activities in your solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider for reuse existing work products and intellectual capital that closely match the needs of your
        circumstances that have been previously produced for similar projects. Always review the dependency diagrams when
        adopting the method to your circumstances to ensure a clear understanding of the dependencies of the work products
        and the impact to your solution.
