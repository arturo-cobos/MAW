<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    From a testing standpoint, the test objectives are a statement of the goals that must be achieved to assure that the
    system objectives are met and that the system will be demonstrated to be acceptable to the user. They should answer the
    question:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What must be achieved in order to assure that the system is at the level of quality that the acceptor of the system
        will expect, and that the user will also be confident the developer has achieved these expectations?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    They should draw the attention or focus on the major testing tasks that must be accomplished to successfully complete
    full testing of the system. The purpose of developing test objectives is to define completion criteria to know when
    necessary and sufficient testing has been done at each test level. Test objectives also assist in gauging the
    effectiveness of the testing process and are driven by test focus areas.<br />
    <br />
    Test objectives are based on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Business functions
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical functions
    </li>
    <li>
        Risks and costs
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Test objectives are defined with varying levels of detail at various levels of testing; there will be test objectives
    at the global cross-functional level as well as the major functional level.<br />
    <br />
    For example, if correctness of bank statement processing is to be a focus area, then one testing objective will
    concentrate on how correctness will be thoroughly proved in bank statement processing by the functional testing
    results.<br />
    <br />
    Define major test objectives and evaluation criteria for each of the business and technical functions. The test
    objectives should be clear and unambiguous. Defining the evaluation criteria for the test is an important and is an
    integral part of the objective definition. The criteria for the successful completion of the test are an item that is
    frequently assumed to exist when in fact it does not. In order to be able to assess if an output meets or exceeds a
    given expectation, the expectation itself must be stated in testable terms. For example, the expected result from the
    calculation (1+4) should not be stated as an appropriate amount. To be testable, specify the answer as a single value
    like 5 or as a range between 0 and 10 if the exact number is not known. If the result of the test were anything other
    than 5 or a number within the specified range, the test would unequivocally fail and the variance would be recorded.
    This example is trivial but it serves to illustrate the point.<br />
    <br />
    Although the goal is to state the requirements in testable terms, this may not always be possible. The required level
    of detail may not yet be available. The process of requirements specification and external design should evolve the
    functional requests from a collection of imprecise statements of user needs to testable business and technical
    (non-functional) specifications. Even though the root of the word specification is specific, achieving specific
    requirements is an extremely challenging exercise. At every point in the specification process, the requirements or
    specifications should be evaluated for testability by ensuring they meet the "SMART" criteria. The acronym stands
    for:<br />
    <br />
    <b>S</b> - Specific<br />
    <br />
    <b>M</b> - Measurable<br />
    <br />
    <b>A</b> - Attainable or Achievable<br />
    <br />
    <b>R</b> - Realistic<br />
    <br />
    <b>T</b> - Timely<br />
    <br />
    The detailed test plans should repeat the exercise of reviewing and setting objectives specific to each level of
    testing. These objectives and associated strategies should dovetail with their predecessor higher level master test
    plan set of test objectives and strategies.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use the documented test focus areas to help define the test objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use JAD or other facilitated workshops techniques to define the objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each business or technical function, define the test objectives and evaluation criteria to be achieved. Relate
        them either to input (event triggered) or to output (function driven).
    </li>
    <li>
        Prioritize the Test Objectives using the risk-based assessment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify that the objectives meet the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely) criteria.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the testing objectives and completion criteria.

    The overall objective of testing is to reduce the risks inherent in computer systems. The process must address and
    minimize those risks. Thus, areas are identified to assist in drawing attention to the specific risks or issues where
    testing effort is focused and which must be handled by the test strategy.<br />
    <br />
    It is virtually impossible and economically not feasible to perform exhaustive testing. The limited resources must be
    used optimally while reducing cycle time and costs. This means that only necessary and sufficient testing must be
    performed thus avoiding under testing and over testing. This leads to the key question: What are the factors, or risks
    that are most important to
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The user or the client?
    </li>
    <li>
        The developer from a system perspective?
    </li>
    <li>
        The service provider from an operational perspective
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The answer lies in considering the Focus areas and selecting the ones that will address or minimize risks.
</p>
<p>
    Test Focus can be defined as those attributes of a system that must be tested in order to assure that the business and
    technical requirements can be met. Refer to Exhibit: Common Test Focus Areas. Consider and include other focus areas as
    necessary, for example:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Technology may be a Test Focus in a cooperative processing environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compatibility of software may be a focus item for vendor packages.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Each of the items on the list of Common Test Focus areas is a potential factor that may impact the proper functioning
    of the system. For example, the risk of the system not being usable may result in certain functions not being
    voluntarily used. Thus the challenge to effective testing is to identify and prioritize those risks, which are
    important to minimize and focus testing in those areas.<br />
    <br />
    It is therefore critical that a joint decision be taken by the users and developers as to what is important and what is
    not. It should not be decided from a single perspective.<br />
    <br />
    It is important to note that, to a major extent, correctness is most likely a high priority test focus for most
    applications. Further considerations are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What degree of correctness is required?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the risks if the functions are not tested exhaustively?
    </li>
    <li>
        What price are the users willing to pay?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This means that the:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Process of determining test focus areas has to be selective, and
    </li>
    <li>
        Selected focus areas have to be ordered in terms of priority.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The concept of risk and risk evaluation makes the decision of how much testing to do, or what types of testing are
    needed to be performed, an economic decision. The economics of testing and risk management determines whether defects
    are acceptable in the system and if so, what is the tolerable level of residual defects. This means that the decisions
    of what gets tested and the thoroughness of testing no longer rely on the judgment of the developers and users. The
    decisions are based on objective criteria.

    Testing types are logical tests which may be conducted in isolation or as combined exercises. They will be performed
    during the physical levels of testing as previously described.<br />
    <br />
    Success of the testing process depends on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Selecting appropriate types of testing necessary to meet the tests’ objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determining the stages or levels of testing when these types of testing would be most effectively used (a test type
        can appear in more than one test level).
    </li>
    <li>
        Developing test conditions to meet the test evaluation criteria.
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating test scripts/test data required to test the conditions above.
    </li>
    <li>
        Managing fixes and re-testing.

    Types of tests are broadly classified as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Functional Tests
    </li>
    <li>
        Structural Tests
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Functional Testing</b><br />
    <br />
    The purpose of functional testing is to ensure that the user functional requirements and specifications are met. Test
    conditions are generated to evaluate the correctness of the application. The following are some of the categories. They
    are organized alphabetically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Audit & Controls testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Conversion testing
    </li>

        Transaction Flow (Path) testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Usability testing
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Technical (Structural) Testing</b><br />
    <br />
    The purpose of structural testing is to ensure that the technical and "housekeeping" functions of the system work. It
    is designed to verify that the system is structurally sound and can perform the intended tasks.<br />
    <br />
    Its objective is also to ensure that the technology has been used properly and that when the component parts are
    integrated they perform as a cohesive unit. The tests are not intended to verify the functional correctness of the
    system, but rather that the system is technically sound.<br />
    <br />
    The some of the Structural categories are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Backup and Recovery testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Contingency testing
    </li>

    Determine the levels of testing which will be needed to meet the test objectives for the project and the Entry and Exit
    Criteria for each level of test.
</p>
<p>
    Establishing entrance criteria (pre-requisites) and exit criteria (conditions for successful completion) for an
    activity to be undertaken is extremely useful for managing any process and testing is no exception.<br />
    <br />
    Entrance criteria are those factors that must be present, at a minimum, to be able to start an activity. In Integration
    Testing for example, before a module can be integrated into a program, it must be compiled cleanly and have
    successfully completed unit testing.<br />
    <br />
    If the entrance criteria of the next test level have been met, the next test level may be started even though the
    current level is still under way. This is how overlapping schedules are allowed.<br />
    <br />
    Exit criteria are those factors that must be present to declare an activity completed. To proclaim System Testing
    completed, two criteria might be that all test cases must have been executed with a defined level of success (if other
    than 100%) and that there must be no more than a mutually agreed number of outstanding problems left unresolved. Exit
    criteria must be specifically expressed using terms such as, "X will be accepted if Y and a Z are complete.<br />
    <br />
    The levels of testing and the objectives for each level are described below. Each of the testing levels represents a
    known level of physical integration and quality of the system solution under development. The levels of testing are
    spelled out in detail in the various test plans.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Developer&nbsp;Testing</b><br />
    <br />
    Unit level testing is the initial testing of new and changed code in a module.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Objectives:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Test the function of a program or module.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test internal logic.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify internal design.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test path and conditions coverage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test exception conditions and error handling.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Integration Testing</b><br />
    <br />
    Integration level tests verify proper execution of application components and do not require that the application under
    test interface with other applications.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Objectives:</b><br />
    <br />
    Technically verify proper interfacing between modules and other system components under test. Includes detecting errors
    resulting from the data transfer between modules internal to the system.<br />
    <br />
    <b>System Testing</b><br />
    <br />
    System level tests verify proper execution of all application components including interfaces to other applications.
    Tests are performed to verify that the system is both functionally and operationally sound.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Objectives:</b><br />
    <br />
    Test control functions
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Perform inter-system test.
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstrate that the system performs both functionally and technically as specified.
    </li>
    <li>
        Perform transaction flow, stress/volume, regression tests etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Systems Integration Testing</b><br />
    <br />
    Systems Integration level tests verify the integration of all applications including external and internal interfaces,
    and the integration of applications with the hardware, software and infrastructure components in a production-like
    environment. The Systems Integration Testing level covers the integration of systems and sub systems which form the
    total set of IT Solution deliverables in a complex project. The process takes acceptance tested system releases and
    ensures that they function together as a total system, and also ensures that they can be deployed in the current live
    environment.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Objectives:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Verify all application and infrastructure deliverables will function as expected.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify the conversion and migration software and processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify the service delivery systems used to support deployment, such as software distribution and help desk will
        function in the production environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Acceptance Testing</b><br />
    <br />
    Acceptance tests verify that the system meets business requirements as specified and that it is in a fit state to be
    accepted by the business for operational use. It is on the basis of these tests, that the sponsor decides to accept or
    reject the system. Acceptance testing simulates the business environment and emphasizes security, documentation and
    regression tests.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Objectives:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Verify that the system meets the user requirements: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Business functions
            </li>
            <li>
                Documentation
            </li>
            <li>
                External interfaces
            </li>
            <li>
                Other special requirements
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    <b>Operability Testing</b><br />
    <br />
    Operability tests verify that the application can operate in the production-operating environment. Results of
    operability tests will be assessed by the Service Delivery area for acceptance of the system into the production
    environment. Operability tests are performed after or concurrent with Acceptance Testing.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Objectives:</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Verify that the product can operate in the production environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test that the system can be recovered / restarted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify that the operation documentation standards are met.

organization may not be in place at the test stage, this task is mainly done to communicate the high level assignments such
as test planning, test preparation, test execution and test reporting. The goal is to identify any critical resource
requirements and to get management approval for additional hiring, special training etc., which normally take time to get
actioned. This also provides an early opportunity to all the stakeholder groups to start thinking about testing.</td>

<td>The need for a test manager and a structured approach to test management and reporting is emphasized here, if these

management to the importance of testing and test management, so that they will be better prepared to commit their resources
full time, and to participate in test planning workshops, etc.<br />
<br />
Test management refers to the management systems that govern the testing activities. These systems refer to the procedures
for problem tracking/management, change management, and progress tracking during testing. The scope of this task is limited
to identifying the processes and procedures needed for the test project to be run effectively and efficiently. The actual
development of the required procedures or pointers to other project level procedures to be used is the subject of the
master test plan activity. <br />
<br />
Communication within the test project is a critical success factor for the project outcome. Ensure that regular status
meetings and other communication related tasks are included in the test project plan.</td>
