<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td><p>
    <strong>Description</strong>: Identify and discover existing assets that have the potential of being leveraged to
    realize one or more elements of a service analysis, design or implementation. Rather than building the asset from
    scratch, consider searching for, discovering and incorporating the asset as is or with modifications.<br />
    <br />
    Perform an analysis of the existing inventory (might include lookup in a repository) of the specific asset type, for
    example a service or a service composition and flow. Use it as the basis for extending the asset type, such as a
    service or a new service composition or flow.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this past is to facilitate and expedite the process of building a
    service-oriented architecture by leveraging existing assets rather than creating them from scratch. This particular
    step involves the attempt to discover and find a relevant asset that can be a candidate for fulfilling a requirement
    for a given asset type. For example, services for the banking industry may be searched for in a business service
    repository for the banking industry. If such a service meets the qualifications required by the project, consider
    incorporating the asset rather than building it from scratch.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Key Considerations:</strong> Service oriented repositories should be searched first in the preference is for
    automated search capabilities. Thus the organization's governments should consider the procurement of such an asset
    repository that will facilitate automated search and find capabilities as well as storing information about the usage
    of the asset.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Steps are:</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Search ecosystem</strong> - If you have access to eco-system resources (e.g., outside the enterprise) then
        access those resources and search for a corresponding asset type.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Auto-discover asset type using agents</strong> - This is part of the automated discovery of asset types if
        the capability exists.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Search/query repository for industry asset type</strong> - For every SOMA activity, task or step, inquire
        as to whether an asset already exists of that type that can be assessed with a fit/gap analysis for use in the
        current context. It should be pointed out that the Industry Assets/Models support the identification, analysis and
        design of requirementsâ€™ based solutions, irrespective of the target environment. The technology-based challenges of
        enterprise integration vary with the selected infrastructure. These aspects should be covered as part of
        Realization decisions. Example of Industry Assets/Models are: (a) IFW for Banking Industry and (b) IAA for
        Insurance Industry (c) Industry content packs (WBSF) (d) Industry frameworks from IBM Software Group
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Query repository for specific assets within the selected industry</strong> - Industry specific Business
        Process Models are an abstraction from the specifics of any one organization, in any one problem domain. The models
        provide the blueprints and standards upon which the specific process and underlying services may be constructed. It
        is key to select from existing IBM assets the Process Models that appear to be relevant to the current problem
        domain being considered.
    </li>
    <li>
        Industry asset, functional area analysis, business process definitions - This is to ensure terms and definitions
        used by client are similar to those used in IBM assets. If they are different then the variations should be
        identified and documented. If they are the same then it is important to map these two terms with similar
        definitions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customize business process (Activities within a Business Process) to meet organizations' need</strong> - As
        part of customization, each activity within the scoped process should be analyzed for its applicability and
        validity to the project under analysis. This will result in the addition of new activities, and the removal of
        unnecessary existing activities from the business process. Note: An activity should always produce consistent
        output triggers in any process context. If conflicting outputs are required, then a new activity should be
        specified. Each activity should be checked to determine whether it is a manual activity, a front end application
        task, or a back-end system task Next key aspect of customization of business processes is to identify control and
        data flows. Control flows bring together the Initiating (Input) and Completing (Output) Trigger Logic analyzed
        earlier. Data Flows can be deduced from the detailed description of activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Review of industry asset use cases and compare with project use cases</strong> - In order to leverage the
        business process model effectively, it is important that use cases that constitute or represent the activities of
        these processes be examined in detail. This is to find what are the similarities, differences and what is missing
        with respect to actions and data elements (a s well as the types) and rules. Similar use cases can serve as a basis
        to build project specific use cases if they do not exist. If the project use case are quite similar to Industry
        Asset use cases we can now leverage underlying BOM (Business Object Model)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consider issues pertaining to specific asset types</strong> -

<div class="stepHeading">Perform Asset Fit Gap Analysis</div>
<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Description:</strong> When an asset is being used it seldom fits exactly what the current context: often it must be
modified in some way. The fit gap analysis is done to ensure we are leveraging existing assets and in doing so, determining
the amount of reuse we can achieve from the current asset. If there is a gap, then we must identify exactly what the gap is
and what the fit is, what aspects are a good fit and what aspects will need to be re-configured, customized or extended
(new development) <br />
<br />
In order to determine the suitability of using an asset as is within a project called it is necessary to perform a fit gap
analysis. It is highly likely that an asset must be customized for a given project. This gap analysis will shed light on
the kinds of customizations potentially needed in order to leverage that asset in a given context. <br />
<br />
<strong>Purpose:</strong> To facilitate the leveraging of existing assets, a fit-gap analysis is done to determine the
extent to which a given asset suits a particular project situation or client environment. <br />
<br />
Note that asset customization is a general term used to denote a set of activities that can be performed on an asset of a
given asset type in order to make it usable for a given project context. These activities cover a spectrum spanning
intrusive (customization) activities all the way to non-intrusive (extension or configuration) activities. <br />
<br />
Should an asset be reused as is or should it be customized in some way? Note that packaged applications are good examples
of where a fit gap analysis is done very early in the project. The result of this fit gap analysis will point to the extent
to which configuration, customization or extension needs to occur within a project. <br />
<br />
<strong>Alternatives:</strong> Note that asset customization is a general term used to denote a set of activities that can
be performed on an asset of a given asset type in order to make it usable for a given project context. These activities
cover a spectrum spanning intrusive (customization) activities all the way to non-intrusive (extension or configuration)
activities. <br /></td>

    <strong>Description:</strong> Making realization decisions is an ongoing activity that takes place in each major
    juncture in the software development process. Realization decisions are made in order to document the key decisions and
    rationale behind them.
</p>
<p>
    Realization decisions are made in order to document the key decisions and rationale behind them and that can lead to
    those decisions in the context of the project.&nbsp; These architectural decisions define how the architectural
    solution is being built.&nbsp; At each juncture there are options to take into account and based on the current context
    and realities of the project combo choices are based that must be recorded so that future modifications have access to
    the rationale used in making those initial decisions.&nbsp; The documentation of these decisions will facilitate future
    enhancements by identifying key variation points and key options that were available but perhaps not quite mature at
    that time and have possibly matured at the present time.&nbsp;

    considering various alternatives.

<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> Provide a specification for how the identified gap of the existing assets with the target
    needs of the project are to be bridged. After a fit gap analysis it is often found that the required asset type, such
    as a business process will have to be modified or customized in order to be useful in the current context. This
    modification can take on several forms: customization or configuration are two ends of the spectrum in which
    configuration is least intrusive and customization requires most intrusive changes. Extension is an additive change
    made to render the asset useful in the given context.
</p>
<p>
    Subsequent to fit gap analysis, the&nbsp;customization&nbsp;of an asset may be necessary. This customization can take
    the form of configuration, extension or true customization which consists of intrusive changes that are less desirable
    to an asset.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Considerations:</strong> Whenever a new asset type is encountered, Leverage Existing Asset is used and this
    task is included as part of that capability pattern.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Alternatives:</strong> Various design alternatives can exist in how to bridge a gap that has been
    identified.&nbsp; Budgetary restrictions strategic and tactical alliances and product directions must be taken into
    account in a realistic fashion.<br />
