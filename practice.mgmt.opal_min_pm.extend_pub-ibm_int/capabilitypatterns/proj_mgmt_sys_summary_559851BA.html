    The Project Management System is the way in which the project is managed. It is documented as a collection of plans and
    procedures, which direct all project management activity, and records, which provide evidence of their implementation.
</p>
<p>
    For each of these plans, procedures and records, the <i>Project Management System Summary</i> typically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        either provides a brief overview of the work product and specifies the location of the full document
    </li>
    <li>
        or (particularly on small projects) replaces the work product entirely.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The <i>Project Management System Summary</i> is a relatively short document. The level of detail is such that all the
    key aspects of the project (i.e. those of which the sponsor and/or functional management should be aware) are fully
    documented but less important information is relegated to the supporting plans, procedures and records.

    Prepare the initial draft of the&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Management System Summary&nbsp;and the first draft of the
    Accelerator Plan&nbsp;for the project.
</p>
<p>
    Reference plans in the AWD Center Management System Summary or the Program Management Plan, where possible, for reuse,
    e.g., ideally the AWD Center Communication Plan works as-is for projects within the AWD Center.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Adapt AWD Processes for project specific environment and requirements.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Adapt and update this procedure and its associated forms, guides and training materials, to ensure success within the
    unique customer and project environment. Customization should be minimized so as to keep the AWD model intact and
    complete to ensure project success.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Prepare the initial draft of the&nbsp;PMSS for the project.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The PMSS contains the following components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Management System Summary
    </li>
    <li>
        Project Schedule
    </li>
    <li>
        Resource Plan
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Management System Summary:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Summarizes the plans, procedures and records required to manage the effort
    </li>
    <li>
        Helps ensure that all members of the team understand how the effort will be managed, and their role within the
        management process.
    </li>
    <li>
        Documents the agreement between the AWD Manager and constituency senior management regarding how the effort and
        resources will be managed
    </li>
    <li>
        Documents any agreed deviations from constituency policy and practice that have been agreed with senior management
        and, if appropriate, the quality assurance function.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides a starting point for audits or compliance reviews
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Typically this summary either:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provides a brief link or reference to other documents, OR
    </li>
    <li>
        Replaces separate work products entirely
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The summary, along with corresponding tasks in the Project Schedule, specifically replaces these work products:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Communication Plan – Specifies communication activities, information and audiences.
    </li>
    <li>
        Configuration Management Plan – Configuration management identifies the hardware/software configuration at a point
        in time, and the systematic control of changes to the configuration for traceability throughout the development
        lifecycle. The plan helps in the execution of CM activities by defining tool(s), steps, roles, responsibilities,
        frequency and timing of audits, and the software work products to be placed under configuration management. It also
        helps establish and maintain the integrity of the software work products. Refer to Software Configuration
        Management Plan and Software Configuration Management Checklist for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Quality Plan – This plan describes the strategy and tasks required to ensure deliverables meet acceptance criteria,
        e.g., quality assurance, process assurance and work product inspection / peer review activities necessary. All
        quality activities to be performed are defined and include into the Project Schedule. This includes
        quality-building activities performed by people inside the team and others outside the team.
    </li>
    <li>
        Launch Strategy – Specifies number and names of launch locations, launch group, steps, risks, documentation
        required, training, infrastructure, system feeds, data conversions, support, help desk, contingency plans, third
        party hardware/software agreements, online Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and timing. Refer to Deployment Plan
        Checklist&nbsp;for more information.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Project Schedule and Resource Plan are typically created using a scheduling tool, help from stakeholders and
    specifying the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Overall Calendar – Specifies business days and holidays
    </li>
    <li>
        Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) – This is a hierarchical decomposition of the phases, activities and tasks that the
        AWD Team must complete. Guidelines: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use an AWD-approved WBS from similar past AWD efforts, if possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fully represent and conform to the AWD Approach, i.e., the WBS must align with this procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Begin all Activities and Tasks with a verb
            </li>
            <li>
                Tightly align the WBS with the&nbsp;Agile Project Definition and&nbsp;Agile Project Definition and Charter,
                making activities for each deliverable explicit
            </li>
            <li>
                Include standard foundational entries (e.g., contingency of 10%-25%) and management entries (e.g., open,
                manage and close activities)
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure all entries contribute directly to the delivery of a specific deliverable and/or represent a step in
                this procedure
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure tasks require at least 40 hours of work to minimize tracking and administration overhead
            </li>
            <li>
                For project WBSs, use multiple iteration timeboxes for requirements, prototyping and development.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plan at the highest level possible, (use days if possible), the day-to-day tasks will be managed by the
                team using the Accelerator Plan.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Resources – For each resource, specify name, ID (i.e., last name or equipment type), general availability hours,
        cost and calendar (i.e., ensure vacations and personal time are fully represented). Ensure alignment with Agile
        Project Definition and Charter&nbsp;Roles and Responsibilities and facilities/equipment specified in the estimate
        section of the&nbsp;Agile Project Definition and Charter.
    </li>
    <li>
        Task dependencies – For each task, define predecessors and successors, and for each define its type (e.g.,
        finish-start) and any gaps or overlaps. Systematically tie tasks from the Start Effort task to the final task
        through a network of dependencies.
    </li>
    <li>
        Task resource assignments – Assign every task to one or more resources and tightly align with the&nbsp;Agile
        Project Definition and Charter Organization and Responsibility Overview Table
    </li>
    <li>
        Task resource hours and cost – Provide a top-down estimate for all tasks based on timebox dates. Plan resources for
        a 40-hour week and avoid overworking, since a 40-hour week is a proven accelerator. Ensure a contingency for known
        tasks of 10%-25% for all core resources. Refer to Estimating&nbsp;Report Checklist for Agile&nbsp;and Estimating
        Considerations Checklist for more information.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Review and finalize scheduling information and ensure the critical path is clear. Ensure start and end dates and
    resource levels are reasonable and in alignment with the Agile Project Definition and Charter, and ensure resource
    weekly hours are level. Ensure the schedule is realistic and achievable.
</p>
<p>
    Integrate the Project Management System Summary components.
</p>
<p>
    Review with stakeholders and update to reflect their feedback
</p>
<p>
    Obtain all approvals, including from Sponsors and other key stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    Baseline the Project Management System Summary to allow full tracking
</p>
<p>
    Ensure the final version is accessible to the team, password-protected and version controlled.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Prepare the first draft of the&nbsp;Accelerator Plan for the project.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The Project Schedule and Resource Plan typically provide phases, activities and milestones, and the Accelerator
    Plan&nbsp;provides detail below this structure. In some situations, the&nbsp;Accelerator Plan may serve as the Project
    Schedule and Resource Plan. In any case, the Accelerator Plan serves as the primary and agile planning tool while
    defining, developing and deploying the solution.
</p>
<p>
    Use the Accelerator Plan to explicitly plan use of high-return Cross Reference to AWD Accelerators/Best Practices, and
    empower the AWD Project Team to review and easily adjust functionality within given timeboxes. This includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identifying, profiling and prioritizing each user group: a group of users with unique functionality in the
        resulting system (e.g., separate screens, reports or processes). For example, banking customers utilizing web
        services may be higher priority in a banking application than an internal bank group assessing utilization of
        online banking services.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifying and prioritizing each business function/requirement of the solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the Iteration column of the Accelerator Plan to group prioritized-requirements into three equal-sized
        iterations
    </li>
    <li>
        Defining timebox end dates and ensuring they match the Project Schedule
    </li>
    <li>
        Defining completion criteria for each timebox, i.e., describing work products required by the Timebox End Date
    </li>
    <li>
        Defining the reuse plan by identifying opportunities for reuse of work products from other projects, and work
        products the project will create that may be reused by other projects. Possible areas of reuse include applets,
        application services, complete sub-routines, documentation, and test cases. Refer to Candidate Asset List for an
        alternative approach to listing reuse candidates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describing the approach for using other&nbsp;Accelerators/Best Practices, including exceptions
    </li>
    <li>
        Reviewing and fine-tuning
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtaining approval from the Business Customer (and Developer if one has been assigned)
    </li>

<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The <i>Project Management System Summary</i> is created during <em>Planning</em>. It may then be expanded during
<em>Starting</em> and is kept up to date throughout the project. 
<p>
    Typically, the <i>Project Management System Summary</i> is reviewed by the project team and approved by other
    stakeholders such as the sponsor, senior management within the delivery organization and the quality assurance
    function.
</p>
<p>
    It is a key input to all compliance and management reviews.
</p>
<p>
    Project Managers should consider the following items when putting together the <em>Project Management System
    Summary</em>:
</p>
<p>
    1. &nbsp;Define the project management processes that are followed when non-WWPMM standards, processes, and/or
    deliverables are required by project stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    2.&nbsp; Include cultural differences and allow for different processes dependent on the receiving country (e.g., how
    are agreements reached successfully in different cultures?).
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cultural differences will need to be factored in if the project team includes global resources or other
            cross-border organizations.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    3.&nbsp; Consider the possibility that the host country, global resources organizations and the client may all use
    different processes, standards, etc. that if left unaddressed, may cause significant conflict between various parts of
    the project team during the course of the project.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In order to have control on effort/cost and quality there should be one set of project processes, procedures, etc.
        that should be agreed to by the host country, global resources, other cross-border participating organizations, and
        the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, there is the possibility that the project will need to determine which CMMI level to follow. If the
        global resource organization is at a different level than the managing host country, it may produce more or less
        documentation than the project requires.
    </li>
    <li>
        Therefore, it is important for the project manager to work with all the project stakeholders to define a single set
        of processes, procedures, standards, etc. that all can agree to use from the outset.
    </li>
    <li>
        The decisions should be clearly documented, communicated and agreed to by all stakeholders during the early stages
        of the project life cycle so there is no confusion amongst the project team during project execution.<br />
