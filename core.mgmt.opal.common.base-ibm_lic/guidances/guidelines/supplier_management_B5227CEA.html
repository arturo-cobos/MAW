</table><p/><strong>Note:</strong> For IBM managed organizations, the IBM Global Supply website provides training and guidance for the
use of the quote and procurement tools. Accounts planning on the acquisition of products should work with their assigned
Procurement Advisor in using these tools to identify the most appropriate products and their sources. <br />
For 'Determining product and source for acquisition', the IBM Global Supply web site provides links to: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe Middle East Africa (EMEA) Geographies Support
    </li>
    <li>
        Technology Acquisition and Asset Services (TAAS) (for support with hardware orders)
    </li>
    <li>
        Quote Center. This site provides quotes on various products and services. A Requisition is not required to obtain a
        quote
    </li>
    <li>
        Buy on demand (Bond)' tool for entering purchase orders for products

        Global Services Procurement (GSP) Client Resource Guide that provides toll-free number for Geography Procurement
        Information Centers

</ul>The Global Services Procurement organization has developed a body of information relating to frequently used products
and has pre-qualified a large number of product suppliers.<br />

more information or aid in evaluating the products, refer to the IBM Global Supply&nbsp;site. Establishing weights and
scores for each product being considered will be more useful in evaluating products. <br />
For IBM managed organizations, the Project Manager can select candidate suppliers informally, without using an RFI, by
identifying candidate subcontractors from the IBM Global procurement list of preferred suppliers or subcontractors. <br />
<img height="12" alt="Informational Reference" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/icon-information-blue.gif" width="12" border="0" /> Refer
to IBM Global Supply website for further details of purchasing subcontractor service via the IBM Global Procurement Process
and releasing subcontractor service via the IBM Global Procurement Process. <br />
Finalizing can also be done by reviewing the proposed contract with IBM Legal and IBM Global Procurement representatives.</td>
