    1 Project Quality Analyst Functions
</h3>
<h2>
    1.1 Quality Activity Planning Guidance
</h2>Quality-related reviews are planned during Project Planning by the project manager with the input and assistance of
the PQA and by others on the Project team. <br />
Quality Review activities may include: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Work Product Inspections, also called Peer Reviews
    </li>
    <li>
        Process Assurance Reviews, performed by the project's PQA
    </li>
    <li>
        Quality Assurance Reviews, performed in accordance with the organization's quality assurance business rules, as
        appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
        System Engineering and Architecture Reviews
    </li>
    <li>
        Other Reviews such as technical reviews for compliance to design and coding standards. This may be a special case
        where tools are used to verify compliance and the review does not fit the mold of a normal Work Product Inspection.
    </li>
</ul>For projects, all quality-related reviews are planned and documented in the project's project quality plan. <br />
For the PQA Group, all PQA activities, including Process Assurance Reviews across projects and organizational teams/units,
are planned, monitored and controlled via the project quality analyst group plan (PQA group plan). <br />
The PQA focus is on performing Process Assurance Reviews; however, as part of reviewing Work Product Inspection Procedure
compliance, it is recommended that the PQA attends and/or checks a representative sample of the project's Work Product
Inspections. 
<h2>
    1.2 Process Assurance Reviews
</h2>All Process Assurance Reviews are performed as scheduled in the PQA group plan and in accordance with the Process
Assurance Review Procedure (IMSP232) and apply to: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Projects (via the process assurance review - project)
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizational unit/team (via the process assurance review - organization)
    </li>
</ul>It is important to understand that Process Assurance Reviews must include assessment of both the process and the
associated product usage, in accordance with the requirements of the relevant documented procedures, policies and
standards. This is essential to satisfy the Specific Goal requirements of the CMMI Process Area - Process and Product
Quality Assurance. 
<h3>
    1.2.1 Process Assurance Reviews - Projects
</h3>The project Process Assurance Reviews are performed in accordance with the Process Assurance Review Procedure
(IMSP232) and using the process assurance review report - project templates.<br />
The PM and the PQA use the project's work type(s) and work classification(s) and consider the project's characteristics
such as effort, risk, and experience of the PM and project team, to decide upon the appropriate type and frequency of
Process Assurance Reviews for the project. <br />
For example: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Effort and duration of the project - a very short, low-risk project may have only one Process Assurance Review.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the organization has shown institutionalization of the procedures, then the review schedule could be altered to
        be less frequent for projects that are identified as low risk or low effort. This should be agreed between
        the&nbsp;Project Manager, the organization's Engineering Process Group (EPG) and the organization's Senior
        Management. Organizations that have small work efforts bundled into releases should be reviewed as projects.
    </li>
</ul>The coverage of Process Assurance Reviews will vary depending on the project's current point in the lifecycle, the
work classification and complexity of the project and the maturity of the project team. <br />
Each review examines different procedural compliance steps based on what should have occurred by the time of the review.
<br />
The different review types are: 
<blockquote dir="ltr">
    <strong>1. Initial Review:</strong> Completed after planning is complete<br />
    <strong>2. Interim Review:</strong> On-going during project lifecycle, either at key milestones (for example, project
    phase end) or at predetermined intervals (for example, every 3 or 6 months; this is common for PM Structure or Service
    Contract projects) as defined in the project quality plan<br />
    <strong>3. Completion Review:</strong> As the project approaches completion (typically during performance of Project
    Completion activities)<br />
    <strong>4. Close Review:</strong> Shortly after the project has completed all activities

<strong>Note:</strong> This "Reviewable Procedures, by Review Types" table is used, in conjunction with Work
Classification(s), to identify which questions in the process assurance review report project templates are recommended as
"Reviewable". The resultant identification of Reviewable procedures is only for guidance; a specific Process Assurance
Review may - 
<ul>
    <li>
        select to review a subset of the Reviewable procedures (for example, where time or resource constraints do not
        allow for coverage of all Reviewable procedures in one Review);
    </li>
    <li>
        include additional procedures (for example, where a prior Review identified non-conformant practices which need to
        be verified as having been addressed satisfactorily).
    </li>
</ul>When the appropriate reviews have been identified, the reviews are scheduled by the PQA and PM, and should be
reflected in the project management schedule and in the project quality analyst group plan (PQA Group Plan). Some
procedures may not be applicable to a review, depending on stage and the nature of the project. The applicability of a
procedure is identified during the Process Assurance Review planning, referring to the actual procedure content to
determine its relevance. Below are the different review types and the procedures that would possibly be reviewed for each
type. Note that most procedures will not have performed all activities within any given phase of the lifecycle. <br />
<img border="0" alt="Informational Reference" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.base-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/icon-information-blue.gif" width="12" height="12" /> The
Project Tailoring Procedure (IMSP150) is use by projects to assess and adopt policies, standards, method, procedures,
guidance and work products, and document the outcome in theproject defined process, which should be used to help plan and
focus Process Assurance activities and, if necessary, help tailor the process assurance review report -project. <br />
<b>Note:</b> These are procedures that would possibly be reviewed for each review type. Some procedures may not be
applicable, depending on the work classification and the outcome of project tailoring, as documented in the project defined
process for the project. The applicability for review is identified during PQA planning; refer to the actual procedure
content for review relevance. 
<h3>
    1.2.2 Process Assurance Reviews - Organizational
</h3>The organizational Process Assurance Reviews are also performed in accordance with the Process Assurance Review
Procedure (IMSP232) and using the process assurance review report - organization templates. <br />
The scope of each review depends on the organizational set-up for the organization-level processes and activities, for
example - metrics management, organizational training, Engineering Process Group (EPG), conduct of Critical Thread Reviews
(CTRs). As different individuals/teams are typically responsible for these organization all activities, each set of
processes (and the associated procedures and products) may be expected to be reviewed separately.<br />
<br />
The frequency of organizational Process Assurance Reviews is typically less than that for discrete projects or PM Structure
projects, for example every three, six or twelve months and is also dependent upon the extent of institutionalization
(sustained process usage <strong>and</strong> sustained high-levels of process compliance). As a minimum, they should be
reviewed annually. <br />
The PQA Group and the Process Assurance Review activities also need to be "objectively evaluated". These reviews should be
performed by a PQA subject matter expert, independent from the organizational PQA Group being reviewed.from the
organizational PQA Group being reviewed. 
<h3>
    1.2.3 Process Assurance Review Reports - Findings Rating<br />
</h3><br />
The purpose of this section is to outline the recommended rating scale for process assurance review report findings. <br />
Each review question, which has actually been reviewed, should be rated as one of the following:<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Comply:</strong> Fully compliant with the procedure and product requirements;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Partial:</strong> Compliant with most, but not all of the procedure and product requirements, but no major
        shortfall;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fail:</strong> Fails to comply adequately with the procedure and product requirements, either completely or
        with major shortfalls;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Not Applicable:</strong> The team is not required to perform the activity that is the focus of the
        question, or has an approved policy or process exception request relating to the procedure and product
        requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    2 Other PQA Functions
</h2>The PQAs are trained in all project management activities, and are expected to act as mentors for Project Managers as
part of their function as a project team member and stakeholder. The PQA should make every effort to establish that
relationship upon being assigned to a project, helping the PM understand how to perform the required project activities
throughout the life of the project. The PQA should be perceived as a help to the project by providing advice and direction,
and not as an auditor. <br />
The PQA is required to track deviation and non-compliance items that arise from Process Assurance reviews, by logging them
in the organizational PQA non-compliance log template, and managing to closure those items they have logged. <br />
It is the Project Manager's responsibility to ensure that the related non-compliant action items and associated action
management documentation are closed, and to notify the PQA when they are complete. The PQA must monitor and report their
status by updating the organizational PQA non-compliance log template upon notification of status changes. The PQA should
discuss the initial finding and subsequent results with the Project Manager prior to any distribution. <br />
The PQA collects additional measurements from each project and provides them to the&nbsp;Project Manager for collection at
the organization level in the process assurance review report -organization. 
<h2>
    3. PQA and Project Manager Functions
</h2>
<h2>
    3.1 Creating the PQA Team
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The PQA must demonstrate an understanding of Project Management and all procedures in use within the organization
    </li>
    <li>
        There must be an individual designated to manage the PQA Team (the Project manager role) whose responsibilities
        include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Managing PQA resources, by tracking their availability and assigning them to projects
            </li>
            <li>
                Leading the PQA team activities like collection and analysis of quality measurements from the projects and
                reporting of results to the organization
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The PQA may not be full time resources performing this function. The practitioners, such as Project Managers,
        Subject Matter Experts, Functional Experts, or any member qualified to perform this role, can perform this function
        as part time. The Senior Management must ensure that the Project Quality Analysts are appropriately skilled and
        trained to perform this function.
    </li>
    <li>
        The organization must determine its approach on assembling the PQA team based on the size, type, and configuration
        of the organization. Whatever way the organization chooses must support all Process Assurance requirements covering
        procedures, policies, and standards, as well as the following concepts:
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Objective evaluation of project and organizational team, policy, standards, process, procedure and
                    product adherence.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Objective evaluation of project work products (note this is discrete from other Validation and
                    Verification activities, such as Work Product Inspections and Testing).
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Support for and collaboration with the PMs during the project, particularly the planning phases.<br />
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        There is no prescribed way to create the PQA team. Each organization must assess its needs, skills, and resource
        availability, but some proven ways are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assign the appropriate number of full-time PQAs to the team, and establish a reporting line for them that
                is independent of all projects. This option is usually viable only for large organizations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enlist the use of part-time PQAs to the team, this may include the use of managers, and assign them to
                projects that are outside their current reporting lines.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    3.2 Managing PQA resources
</h2>The Project Manager needs to maintain a schedule of each PQA's commitments, compiled from the project schedules the
PQAs collected during project planning. The PQA resources should be managed in much the same way as project resources. It
is suggested that the PQA Team develop a schedule of PQA activity that is maintained for a period of time - a year,
quarter, month, or whatever seems reasonable based on the organization's characteristics. The project quality analyst group
plan (PQA group plan) is specifically intended to support planning and control of PQA Group activities, especially Process
Assurance Reviews. <br />
In addition, the Project Manager should have information about upcoming projects for some future period of time at the
organization level, and should use that information in conjunction with the project quality analyst group plan (PQA group
plan) to predict needs and availability of PQA resources.<br />
<h2>
    3.3 PQA Team Tracking, Measuring, and Reporting Guidance
</h2>
<h2>
    3.3.1 PQA Reporting Guidance
</h2><img border="0" alt="Instructional Link" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.base-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/icon-link-action.gif" width="17" height="15" /> The PQA
reports and collects measurements for each project in accordance with the Process Assurance Review Procedure (IMSP232) and
Process Assurance Management Procedure (IMSP237). <br />
The organizational PQA measurement report is provided for use in reporting PQA activities. If the organization's PQA team
decides to use that report, it should tailor the report form to support the measurements being reported by the
organization. The content of the organizational PQA measurement report is sourced from a consolidation of data from the - 
<ul>
    <li>
        project quality analyst PQA group plan;
    </li>
    <li>
        process assurance review report - project
    </li>
    <li>
        process assurance review report - organization
    </li>
    <li>
        organizational PQA non-compliance log template
    </li>
</ul>In addition to the organizational PQA measurement report, the Project Manager may use a range of additional
spreadsheets or presentations to summarize key findings and trends, tailored to the needs of the recipients.<br />
<h2>
    3.3.2 PQA Team Reporting Guidance
</h2>The PQA Team should work with senior management to establish the quality measurements to be collected for the
organization and the frequency and manner for reporting them. The PQA team may decide to collect additional measurements
for the purpose of analyzing effectiveness of the organization's processes, and/or the success of the projects' use of the
processes. Below is a list of measurements from which the organization may choose, but there may be others created by the
organization. <br />
The format of the measurement may be: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Raw numbers (that is 4 reviews were scheduled and 2 were completed)
    </li>
    <li>
        Percentage of scheduled activities that were completed (that is 50% of scheduled reviews were completed)
    </li>
    <li>
        Any other method that makes sense to management and is specific
    </li>
</ul>The measurements MAY be reported at any of the following levels: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Project
    </li>
    <li>
        Department
    </li>
    <li>
        Application area
    </li>
    <li>
        Manager area
    </li>
    <li>
        Any other combination that makes sense for the organization
    </li>
</ul>The measurements MUST be reported at the organization level, and it is recommended that they be collected monthly,
with year-to-date totals and comparisons to prior years showing trends. <br />
The organization's Engineering Process Group (EPG) should use compliance data to identify areas of weakness in the
procedures or training needs in the organization. 
<h2>
    3.3.3 Recommended Measurements
</h2>The Measurements should be defined together with the Measurements Group of the related organization. 
<ul>
    <li>
        Hours planned and spent for the following categories for each project (should be recorded in the project's
        schedule), and for PQA Team activities (should be recorded by the PQA Team): 
        <ul>
            <li>
                PQA planning activities
            </li>
            <li>
                PQA reporting/communications activities (preparing and delivering PQA reports)<br />
                PQA related training
            </li>
            <li>
                PQA consulting (for all mentoring and for the initial review of the project plan and reviews of the
                re-planning documents)
            </li>
            <li>
                Process Assurance Reviews (executing the review and tracking the non-conformances)
            </li>
            <li>
                PQA work product audits (executing and documenting)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Non-conformances opened, to be resolved and closed, by Procedure and by Project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Non-conformances by process area, for the purpose of process analysis
    </li>
    <li>
        Coverage of Process Assurance Reviews by process area; this is recommended when process assurance activities are
        scaled.

<p>
    <strong>Note related with section 1.2.1 Process Assurance Reviews - Projects:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For PM Structures which also oversee discrete projects, the Process Assurance Reviews should be applied separately
        at both PM Structure and individual project(s) levels.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Small (or very small) work efforts are not required to be assured explicitly; they are assured at the owning PM
        Structure level. During such Process Assurance Reviews, the PQA should select a "representative sample" of such
        work efforts to assess compliance.<br />
