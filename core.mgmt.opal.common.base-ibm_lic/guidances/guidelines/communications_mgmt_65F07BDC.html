<h3>
    1.2 Communicate with the sponsor
</h3>
<p>
    When communicating with the sponsor, checks that the right people are receiving the appropriate messages. Different
    messages are often directed at different levels within the organizations. Often there is a single individual or group
    that acts as the communications link to the rest of the sponsor's organization. For most communications this is
    sufficient. There may be specific messages, however, that require that traditional links be by-passed or supplemented
    with additional communications within the sponsor's organization. Considers these communications carefully and seeks
    the advice of the management team in these instances. Maintains a correspondence log with the sponsor.
</p>
<p>
    The output correspondence log can be in the form of e-mails or any other correspondence with the sponsor. There is no
    standard template for correspondence.

    5. Reporting
</h3>
<p>
    Reporting includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Preparing and reviewing reports
    </li>
    <li>
        Reporting of sub-project, team, or project status to the delivery organization's management
    </li>
    <li>
        Reporting of individual status to the project manager
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    5.1 Project Status Report
</h3>The project status report is a scheduled report that is created by the top-level project manager for the project. The
Project status report includes: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Status that describes the state of the project vs. the project plans
    </li>
    <li>
        Progress that describes what the project has accomplished
    </li>
    <li>
        Forecasts that predict future project status and progress based on current project data
    </li>
</ul>The project status report is created by the project manager who has the responsibility for the overall project. The
project manager follows the procedures and any business unit policies as described in the project management system summary
in preparing the report. The report is created by aggregating sub-project/team and subcontractor status reports into the
project status report. Augmentation with graphics is helpful in showing progress or potential problems. 
<h3>
    5.2 Prepare and present project or sub project team status
</h3>
<p>
    The sub-project team status report is a scheduled report that is created by the project manager or team leader for each
    sub-project or team within the project organizational unit that they manage. The sub-project team status report
    provides information about the progress that the sub-project or team has made relative to its project management
    schedule during the reporting period. The purpose of the report is to alert the next-level project manager to any
    variances or problems so that corrective actions can be initiated. It is also used by the next level project manager to
    create his or her own Sub-Project/Team Status Report. Where the next level manager is the top-level project manager, it
    is used to create the overall project status report that is presented to the line management and the sponsor.
</p>
<p>
    The steps are generic and can be used to prepare sub-project team status report for any level of management within the
    delivery organization including the sponsor when the sponsor is internal. Reports needs, however, to be tailored to the
    specific audience to which they are directed. A sub-project team status report may address a single sub-project,
    aggregating data from individual status reports or may address multiple sub-projects owned by a single project
    organizational unit. Team status reports are generally used to report status on related tasks, such as a line item. A
    one-page management summary is usually sufficient for senior management and to prepare this:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Reviews the communications management plan to identify the report(s) to prepare as well as audience, content, and
        format.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the project procedures description has been used to establish a status reporting procedure, uses this procedure
        to identify and understand the specific instructions for preparing status reports
    </li>
    <li>
        Reviews previous status reports so trends and issues are easier to recall.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarizes the financial status: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reports budgeted and actual cost to date, and where appropriate, budgeted and actual revenue and profit
            </li>
            <li>
                Reports cost variances, and where appropriate, revenue and profit variances
            </li>
            <li>
                Reports the forecast of project costs at completion and, where appropriate, revenue and profit
            </li>
            <li>
                Reviews the schedule variances
            </li>
            <li>
                Reports the forecast effort and completion date for the project
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarizes earned value indicators if appropriate to the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies accomplishments for current reporting period using the project management schedule and lower level
        status reports. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identifies and reports the achievements since the last reporting period
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifies and reports achievements planned but not completed during the reporting period
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifies and reports the work products completed since the last reporting period
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifies and reports the products planned but not completed during the reporting period
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies accomplishments planned for the next reporting period using the project management schedule and other
        available data.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarizes the status of changes, issues, compliance incidents, and risks by reviewing them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarizes the status of quality both in terms of project deliverables and the effectiveness of project processes
        contributing to quality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develops the project status summary as follows: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Provides an overall project status rating by summarizing the overall status of the sub-project or project
                being reported using the above information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Overall status may be reported using a "Project grade" or "Three-level color" scale: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A / Green = the project is well controlled. Some issues have been identified, but effective actions
                        are planned for solving them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        B / Yellow = the project has problems that require change in plans. The cost may exceed the
                        estimate or budget, and/or sponsor satisfaction is at risk. Additional control is essential to
                        bring the project back under control.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C / Red = the project has serious problem(s). For example, cost overruns or rejection by the
                        sponsor are unavoidable. Project management needs to take drastic steps to turn the project around.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Documents each of the project milestones showing their status (met/not met), and planned and forecast
                completion dates. Provides any explanatory comments necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the overall project status indicates "problems" or "serious problems", reviews the report with the
                project management team to ensure that remedial actions have been identified and included in the report,
                and determines how best to communicate the status to the sponsor.

<h3>
    5.3 Reporting to Senior Management
</h3>After the project status report has been completed, the communications management plan may require a separate,
one-page, "management summary" for senior management of the organization. Follows these steps, if required: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Determines if the organization has guidelines for producing a management summary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Focuses on providing the information in which senior management is interested; this includes health issues and
        concerns on which they must act.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoids describing technical issues for which the project team is responsible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determines corrective actions to be taken to address variances and issues. Focuses on communicating to management
        those actions that management needs to be aware of because of their potential impact or those actions that must be
        escalated to management.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reports status at the project level (or in some cases the sub-project level) and no lower.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reports on milestones and deliverables, no lower.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reports on project health. Health information is obtained from the results of prior health reviews.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reviews the contents of the management summary with the senior management of the delivery organization per the
        <b><i>communications management plan</i></b>. For internal projects, senior management may also be the project
        sponsor. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pays particular attention to such matters as delayed milestones, missed deliverables, open issues, pending
                risks, exceptions to policies and procedures, negative trends, and sponsor satisfaction issues
            </li>
            <li>
                Reviews those corrective actions that require senior management assistance
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies opportunities and threats related to any selected corrective actions. The efforts to improve the
        schedule may have a negative result on costs, and efforts to reduce cost may prolong the schedule.<br />

<h3>
    5.4 Prepare Individual Status Report
</h3>An individual status report is a scheduled report that is created by each project team member on a periodic basis,
typically weekly or biweekly. This report captures the effort (time) spent on the work that is in progress, an estimate of
the effort required to complete the work in progress, and a list of comments for the project manager. The purpose of the
individual status report is to provide the team leader or project manager of the sub-project or overall project with an
accurate account of time spent on work by each individual and an assessment of the effort that remains to complete the
assigned work. 
<ol>
    <li>
        Reviews previous project status report in order to understand major issues or concerns facing the project as a
        whole.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reviews the project procedures description to understand the organization or project's instructions for preparing
        an individual status report
    </li>
    <li>
        Reviews the operational schedule to determine the tasks, components, deliverables, or milestones the project
        manager or the team were responsible for completing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reports completion status on tasks, components, deliverables, or milestones, using the mechanism defined by the
        project manager requesting the data (for example, percent complete, effort spent, or Not Started/ Started/
        Completed).
    </li>
    <li>
        Reports effort remaining (work still to be completed) on tasks, components, deliverables, or milestones.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides comments that need to be brought to the attention of the project manager or input on:

<strong>Note:</strong> The Complaint Management Tool (CMT) is a worldwide application that is used to manage all client
complaints in all business units and all geographies. CMT is a proven, high-volume, production application that was
designed to help manage and escalate these complaints within the Complaint Management process. IBM personnel submit these
client complaints in CMT, and CMT assigns the complaint to a resolution owner, who is responsible for the complaint until
closure.</td>
