    2. Risk Management Preparation Guide
</h2>Risk is a measure of the potential inability to achieve overall project objectives within defined cost, schedule, and
technical constraints. Risk management is a proactive event-based approach to continuously assess "what might go wrong" and
set activities into action to control, minimize or even eliminate the risk. Risks are typically defined with parameters
such as the probability and likelihood of failing to achieve a particular outcome, the consequences and impacts of failing
to achieve that outcome, and thresholds to determine if the status of a risk requires action. 
<h2>
    2.1 Define risk parameters
</h2>
<p>
    <br />
    When determining risk parameters consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Define consistent criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and severity levels.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the thresholds to trigger management activities. Examples of thresholds include the following: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Project-wide threshold could be established to involve senior management when product costs exceed 10% of
                the target cost or when Cost Performance Indexes (CPIs) fall below 0.95.
            </li>
            <li>
                Schedule threshold could be established to involve senior management when Schedule Performance Indexes
                (SPIs) fall below 0.95.
            </li>
            <li>
                Performance thresholds could be set to involve senior management when specified key design items (such as
                processor utilization) exceed 125% of the intended design.
            </li>
            <li>
                Key tasks, project phase-end, or cutover dates are in jeopardy; planned Gross Profit is in jeopardy.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Define boundaries on the extent to which thresholds are applied against or within a category. These boundaries can
        be used to assist in scoping risk management effort and avoiding excessive resource expenditures.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    2.2 Define risk management strategies
</h2>
<p>
    Risk Management Strategies are high level plans for how various risks will be addressed. Typical strategies include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Accepting the risk: the "do nothing" option. Assume the risk without engaging in any special efforts to control it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Research the risk: conduct an in-depth investigation to determine the potential causes of the risk. (This strategy
        is typically followed by one of the other strategies based on research results).
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduce the risk: make changes to the project to reduce the risk to an acceptable level while still meeting project
        objectives or minimizing the impact on the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer the risk: Reallocate project requirements to other aspects of the project (for example, add funding, add
        schedule or reduce requirements).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When determining risk management strategies consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scope of the risk management effort.
    </li>
    <li>
        Methods and tools to be used for risk identification, risk analysis, risk mitigation, risk monitoring, and
        communication.
    </li>
    <li>
        Project specific sources of risk.
    </li>
    <li>
        How the risks are to be organized, categorized, compared, and consolidated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Parameters, including likelihood, consequences, and thresholds, for taking action on identified risks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk mitigation techniques to be used, such as prototyping, simulation, alternative designs, or evolutionary
        development.
    </li>
    <li>
        Definition of risk measures to monitor the status of the risks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Time intervals for risk monitoring or reassessment.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    3. Risk Analysis Guide
</h2>
<h2>
    3.1 Classify risk
</h2>Structures for classifying risks are often based on risk factors or risk consequences, and risks are classified by
applying appropriate criteria, such as: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Risk factor-based. Group risks by source. For example all risks relating to "unstable requirements" are grouped
        together.
    </li>
    <li>
        Consequence-based. Group risks that lead to the same general consequence. For example, all risks that might impact
        the "quality of specifications" could be grouped together.
    </li>
</ul>It is important to clearly partition risks based on the scheme selected. Classification based on risk factors may
result in a risk list such as the following: <br />
Group 1 - Risks resulting from "unstable requirements" 
<ul>
    <li>
        Risk 1 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consequence 1
            </li>
            <li>
                Consequence 2
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk 2 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consequence 3
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>Group 2 - Risks resulting from the "project technical environment" 
<ul>
    <li>
        Risk 3 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consequence 3
            </li>
            <li>
                Consequence 4
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk 4 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consequence 4
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk 5 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consequence 5
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>Grouping risks in this manner leads to creating separate mitigation plans for risks related to "unstable requirements"
and risks related to the "project technical environment". 
<h2>
    3.2 Impact categories
</h2>
<p>
    When determining risk impact categories consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Determine if there is a sponsor or delivery organization policy that prescribes the framework to be used for impact
        categorization.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine if the prescribed framework fits the current needs of the project and if it will help the project
        effectively plan and manage risk.
    </li>
    <li>
        Adapt the prescribed framework or, in the absence of a prescribed framework, create a framework that best meets
        needs of the project.
    </li>
</ul>Risk impact categories include the following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Financial loss. Impacts to project costs resulting from budget overruns or penalties.
    </li>
    <li>
        Time loss. Impacts to project schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
        Quality loss. Impacts to acceptance criteria.
    </li>
    <li>
        Functionality loss. Impacts to some property that the delivered solution possesses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Resource loss. Impacts to staff, skills, equipment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sponsor satisfaction loss. Impacts to measured sponsor satisfaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Benefit loss. Impacts to business benefits that are attained.
    </li>
</ul>Note that the first three risk impact categories (financial, time, and quality) are the most frequently used. 
<h2>
    3.3 Analyze risk
</h2>Risk analysis is carried out at a level of detail sufficient to determine the relative importance for planning
cost-effective risk responses. <br />
In analyzing risks, it is important to remember a number of complicating issues, such as: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Risk factors and consequences can interact in unanticipated ways (for example, schedule delays may force
        consideration of a new strategy that reduces overall project duration but increases project costs).
    </li>
    <li>
        A single occurrence of a risk can have multiple impacts (for example, when late delivery of a key component
        produces cost overruns, schedule delays, penalty payments, and a lower-quality product).
    </li>
    <li>
        Common techniques involving mathematical manipulation of values assigned to impact, probability, and time frame,
        often creates a false impression of the precision and reliability of risk analysis.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
    Evaluating the probability and impact of risks essentially requires a subjective judgment. Describing the probability
    and impact of risks with numbers can easily give a false impression of precision and reliability. IBM's Worldwide
    Project Management Method (WWPMM) recommends the use of qualitative descriptions when evaluating risks. If desired,
    ordinal numbers that rank the properties of risks can be associated with the qualitative descriptions.

impact, probability and time frame.

        For projects with a single project organizational unit and for most projects with multiple project organizational
        units, the use of a three-level scale is sufficient.
    </li>
    <li>
        For programs and complex projects, a five-level or n-level scale may be appropriate. In choosing the scale to be
        used, consider the purpose of the evaluation effort.

    Risk exposure is derived from combining the descriptions of impact and probability. Risk exposure can be used as a
    means of prioritizing or ranking risks to help focus risk management efforts.
</p>
<p>
    The following shows qualitative descriptions of exposure for various combinations of probability and impact.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Binary level<br />
        There are four possible values of risk exposure 
        <ul>
            <li>
                yes-yes = high
            </li>
            <li>
                yes-no = moderate
            </li>
            <li>
                no-yes = moderate
            </li>
            <li>
                non-no = low
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        3-level<br />
        There are nine possible values of risk exposure 
        <ul>
            <li>
                h-h, h-m, m-h = high
            </li>
            <li>
                h-l, m-m, l-h = moderate
            </li>
            <li>
                m-l, l-m, l-l = low
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        5-level<br />
        There are twenty-five possible values of risk exposure 
        <ul>
            <li>
                vh-vh, vh-h, h-vh = very high
            </li>
            <li>
                vh-m, h-h, h-m, m-vh, m-h = high
            </li>
            <li>
                vh-l, vh-vl, h-l, h-vl, m-m, l-vh, l-h, vl-h = moderate
            </li>
            <li>
                m-l, m-vl, l-m, l-l, vl-m = low
            </li>
            <li>
                l-vl, vl-l, vl-vl = very low
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        n-level<br />
        There is a continuum of values for the risk exposure. The range of these values will depend on the maximum value
        used for the impact
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    3.4 Ranking criteria
</h2>
<p>
    Ranking may be based on risk exposure (probability and impact), or based on individual considerations related to
    probability, impact or time frame. For example, it may be decided that it is important to work first on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All high-probability risks regardless of impact.
    </li>
    <li>
        High-impact risks with up to medium probability.
    </li>
    <li>
        All risks expected to occur within an immediate time frame.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These decisions are based on the expert judgment and experience of the decision maker (such as the project manager and
    team at a project level, or project executive at an organizational level).
</p>
<p>
    If dealing with a large number of critical risks, it may be necessary to categorize the results of the ranking to
    assist in monitoring and reporting.<br />
    Additional questions that are considered when prioritizing risks include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is currently important to the sponsor, the project, and/or corporate management?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are there critical milestones or dependencies faced by the project that may be impacted by risks that have been
        identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        What resources are available for risk planning?
    </li>
    <li>
        What risks may have the greatest "downstream" or secondary impact?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In prioritizing critical risks, it is important to think about containment (mitigation and contingency) plans as well
    as their cost and probable effectiveness. Risks for which there are no mitigation actions, or for which mitigation
    costs are prohibitive, may have a low priority. These are generally risks that the project is willing to accept with no
    further action except to continue to observe for further likelihood of occurrence. In contrast, risks that have low
    containment costs with a high probability of being contained may have a high priority.
</p>
<p>
    The time frame can also affect the priority of a risk. The same risk, occurring at different points in time, can have
    different priorities. Usually the later a risk consequence is expected to affect the project, the more time there is to
    deal with the risk and the lower the priority. In contrast, when the time frame is very short, the priority typically
    must be increased.
</p>

<h2>
    4.1 Transfer and assign risk responsibility
</h2>
<p>
    When transferring and assigning risk responsibility consider the following options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To the sponsor or supplier through terms in the Agreement (original or amended).
    </li>
    <li>
        To another internal organization not connected with the project through formal written documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        To another organization in the same business unit as the delivery team through informal written documentation.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When transferring and assigning risk responsibility consider the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Who could solve the risk?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who have the power and authority to allocate resources?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who is accountable or can be held accountable for the risk?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who has the time to manage the risk?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who has the ability to take action?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In determining risk assignment, it is important to consider the concepts of accountability, responsibility, and
    authority:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Control refers to the ability to influence the outcome due to the boundaries that exist around the situation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Accountability defines who is ultimately held "accountable" for determining the risk approach, as well as the
        success or failure of mitigation and/or use of contingency plans.
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsibility defines who is charged with developing and implementing (or overseeing) risk mitigation actions
        and/or use of contingency plans.
    </li>
    <li>
        Authority refers to the right and ability to assign resources for mitigation and/or contingency.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    4.2 Risk mitigation plan
</h2>
<p>
    The purpose of risk mitigation planning is to identify, define, plan, and staff activities that will lead to reducing
    the probability of a risk occurrence or the impact of a risk that might occur. These countermeasures aim to change
    aspects of the risk factors leading to the risk and/or to attack the consequence of the risk itself.
</p>
<p>
    The Risk Mitigation Plan is sometimes referred to as the Contingency Plan.
</p>
<p>
    Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Risk factor: Design skills of the team are considered to be too low 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mitigation: Plan a training program in required skills.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk consequence: Design will not meet the performance criteria 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mitigation: Use a subject matter expert during the design phase.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mitigation: Conduct design reviews throughout the design phase.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When creating risk mitigation plans include the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Modifying or adopting new strategies and project approaches (for example, planning a workaround if a dependency is
        not met on time).
    </li>
    <li>
        Modifying or adding activities to project plans (for example, reviews, testing).
    </li>
    <li>
        Modifying or adopting procedures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modifying human resource component of the project (for example, add skills, train, use subject matter experts).
    </li>
    <li>
        Modifying the organization component of the project (for example, adding project office, increasing involvement of
        management).
    </li>
    <li>
        Modifying the culture in which the project operates (for example, improving communications).
    </li>
    <li>
        Modifying the technological component of the project (for example, using proven technology).
    </li>
    <li>
        Modifying the scope of the project (for example, removing less important components).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Risks identified during project definition can often be mitigated by modifying the approach to the project. For
    example, risks associated with software development projects that are highly complex can be reduced by adopting an
    incremental approach. Similarly, risks associated with projects that have a high level of uncertainty can be reduced by
    adopting an evolutionary approach.
</p>
<p>
    In planning risk mitigation, the cost of the mitigation is compared to the benefit or reduction in risk exposure
    expected from implementing the mitigation plan. If the value of the impact of the risk can be estimated, it can be
    compared to the cost of mitigation.
</p>
<p>
    In many projects where risk is exceptional or high, a small number of factors such as new technology, an inexperienced
    team, or a first-time project manager contribute to much of the overall risk. Plans are developed and implemented to
    manage and contain those risk factors (for example, education in the new technology, adding experienced people to the
    team, or close involvement on the part of middle management).

    5. Risk Tracking Guide
</h2>
<h2>
    5.1 Continuously assess risk
</h2>
<p>
    <br />
    Tracking is the process in which risk data is acquired, compiled, and analyzed for trends and effectiveness of
    <b><i>risk management plan</i></b>(s).
</p>
<p>
    When collecting and reporting risk tracking data consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Status information is only as good as its accuracy and timeliness.
    </li>
    <li>
        Out of date data is more dangerous to decision makers than no data at all; a wrong decision can be made on false
        assumptions.
    </li>
    <li>
        When a group of indicators is required to assess a risk occurrence, all the data must be from the same time period.
    </li>
    <li>
        The analysis of risk data is the responsibility of the person assigned to the risk and/or responsible for dealing
        with the risk.
