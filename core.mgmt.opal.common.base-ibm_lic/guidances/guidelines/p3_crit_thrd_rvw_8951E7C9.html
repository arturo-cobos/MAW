Ensure the objectives of the P3 - Process, Performance and People Critical Thread Reviews (CTRs) are obtained by further

<h2>
    Scope
</h2><br />
<b>This guideline applies to:</b> <br />
An organization describing how to conduct the P3 - Process, Performance and People Critical Thread Reviews (CTRs) meetings,
including defining the communications management plan (organizational) for P3 CTRs, enabling the project portfolio tracking
system and conducting the reviews using the expanded description of the agenda items.

<h2>
    Overview
</h2><br />
The P3 - Process, Performance and People Critical Thread Reviews (CTRs) are an established communication vehicle used by
the various levels of management throughout the organization, to ensure that activities are managed consistently. These
CTRs include a standard agenda, with regularly discussed topics, which: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensures management activities are proceeding as per the plans and schedules.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies issues that need to be escalated to a higher level of management.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies items to be added to the Process Improvement Plans.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determines any required corrective actions.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Details
</h2>
<h2>
    1. Communications management plan for P3 CTR (organization level)
</h2><br />
The <strong><em>communication management plan (organizational) for P3 CTR</em></strong> provides the basis for defining the
organization level plan. However, the organization context may lead to a need to tailor this template. Some typical
situations and their tailoring approach includes: <br />
(a) Matrix organization structure with several lines of management providing oversight of the project. <br />
One approach is to managing all lines of management needs in one <strong><em>communications management plan
(organizational) for P3 CTR</em></strong>, by identifying separately the CTRs for each line of management. In a very large
and fragmented organization this may be a challenge. An alternative is for each line of management to manage their own
<strong><em>communications management plan (organizational) for P3 CTR</em></strong> and require the project manager to
select and integrate those relevant to the project. <br />
(b) Integrated P3 Critical Thread Reviews <br />
The organization size and allocation of responsibility for process, performance and people functions in an organization may
lead to one person having responsibility across several pillars of review. In this case it may be more efficient to merge
the P3 reviews at a single level. The agenda templates may be tailored to achieve that intent. <br />
The first level review is described using a merged agenda, as the information from the project manager feeds into each
pillar of the P3 CTR. A merged agenda is an effective use of the project managers time. The allocation of responsibilities
in a organization may lead to the splitting of this integrated agenda into the component pillars of P3. 
<h2>
    2. Project portfolio tracking system
</h2><br />
The complexity of collecting, and reporting information across a range of projects in a portfolio typically leads to the
need for this system to be automated with an IT system. <br />
(a) A major challenge in establishing a project portfolio tracking system is the efficient collection of information which
may be in other project level tools. For example, the solution development technical environment of a project may track
defects in dedicated tools. If a lot of information has to be re-entered into another tool for portfolio reporting purposes
only, the value of that effort may be questioned. The same concern arises with project management tools contain schedule or
financial information which may need to be re-entered. There are benefits in tool integration or data exchange between the
tools which contain the information and the project portfolio tracking system which reports on that information. <br />
(b) A challenge with portfolio information being distributed across several tools is how this information is merged in
portfolio reports , For example, the financial information may be in one tool and quality metrics in another,. It is
essential that identification of the entity called 'the project' is consistent across all tools if there is an expectation
of building portfolio reports of merged information. <br />
(c) To ensure complete portfolio reports information about every project must be available, and it must be current to the
reporting period. 
<h2>
    3. P3 Level 1 CTR Agenda Items
</h2><br />
The purpose of the P3 level 1 CTR is to review project status report for insight into the project. Validate appropriate
project management discipline is being applied. Verify and validate all key information is reported, and hence validate the
project health assessment. <br />
<img height="12" alt="Informational Reference" src="./../../../core.mgmt.opal.common.base-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/icon-information-blue.gif" width="12" border="0" /> Refer to
the P3 Level 1 CTR Agenda attached to the <strong><em>meeting documentation</em></strong>. <br />
First line manager review responsibilities may include: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Respond to escalation of issues, either by accepting and hence owning them, or re-directing the escalation to other
        stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        Respond to and manage procedures requiring higher levels of approval than the project manager is authorized.
        Examples include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Change requests above clip levels
            </li>
            <li>
                Re-baselining project plans, ensure sponsor agreement documented
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul><br />
Review and update portfolio tracking tool records to ensure information is valid for current reporting period. <br />
The following steps includes standard agenda items to include in the P3 Level 1 Critical Thread Review:
