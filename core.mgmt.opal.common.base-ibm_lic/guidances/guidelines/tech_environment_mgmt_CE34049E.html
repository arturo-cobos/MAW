    Purpose
</h2><br />
<b>Use this guideline:</b> <br />
To plan or customize, and to start the technical environment, ensure that it provides the expected service throughout the
project; and de-install it (or schedule its de-installation) if necessary. Defining the requirements for, estimating the
costs of, and tracking the effectiveness of the technical environment is key to the success of the project and to oversee
the implementation of the office suite, project management, and product technical environment for the one or more phases of
the project. 
<hr />
<h2>
    Scope
</h2><br />
<b>This guideline applies to:</b> <br />
All projects that need to start or customize the technical environment. 
<hr />
<h2>
    Overview
</h2><br />
<b>This guideline includes:</b> 
<ul>
    <li>
        An office suite: spreadsheet, word processor, presentation graphics, and/or drawing tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        Office communications: mail and access to shared office suite files.
    </li>
    <li>
        Project management tools that support: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Project management and operational scheduling
            </li>
            <li>
                Time tracking
            </li>
            <li>
                Cost tracking
            </li>
            <li>
                Risk management
            </li>
            <li>
                Project control book (PCB)
            </li>
            <li>
                Access to business systems
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Tools that support technical activities in all project stages: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Conception
            </li>
            <li>
                Development
            </li>
            <li>
                Qualification
            </li>
            <li>
                Launching or deployment
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul><br />
These tools make up that part of the technical environment referred to as the "product technical environment".<br />
Features of the project management and the technical tool set support the configuration management of the technical work
products.<br />
The technical environment has a variety of characteristics such as: 
<ul>
    <li>
        It may already be in place, may need to be adapted, or may need to be completely built. Project needs, costs,
        expected benefits, and risks must be carefully balanced before making a decision to build a technical environment
        or even to adapt one that exists.
    </li>
    <li>
        It may be a deliverable, as the technical environment or parts of it may be left behind or transferred to the
        sponsor at the end of the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        It may be provided (in its entirety or in part) by the sponsor or another supplier, including a business unit
        within the delivery organization.
    </li>
</ul><br />
In any case, when planning the project, project management must describe the technical environment required by the
particular project and then validate the technical environment architecture and proposed service level with the
organization that provides it. <br />
There are four stages of Technical Environment Management (TEM) namely: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Technical environment planning
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical environment implementation
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical environment maintenance
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical environment removal
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>
    1. Technical Environment Planning
</h2><br />
The purpose of this activity is to establish the overall technical environment plan, as opposed to the detailed plan that
is finalized when starting a phase of the project.<br />
This activity includes: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Defining the key options for the technical environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifying required features for the technical environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Describing the overall architecture of the technical environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Planning implementation of the technical environment
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    1.1 Define key options
</h2><br />
The technical environment used to create and deliver the solution often has a significant impact on the project. <br />
For example, building a web site, which users navigate as if they were accessing a relational database, requires
implementing thousands of hyperlinks and ensuring the integrity of these links. Clearly, the approach, risks, costs,
quality of the result, and the duration for building the web site depend entirely on choices made for the technical
environment. <br />
In this example, an option may be to simply use a web page editor, to maintain a list of the links to be implemented in a
spreadsheet, and/or to implement (manually) the links using this editor. Another option would be to create a relational
data base containing the future content of the site, and to find or build an application that generate the web pages and
hyperlinks from the data base. <br />
The choice of options is a key decision for shaping the project. It may even be the case that without a proper technical
environment the solution will not be feasible.<br />
Additionally, some elements of the technical environment may become part of the solution itself. Unless we develop specific
components, the first option may cause problems related to ownership rights, but will be safer than developing specific
components. <br />
The key options for the technical environment are determined during project definition and described in the key options in
the project definition. During Planning and Starting activities, they will be developed in the key options of the technical
environment plan. <br />
When determining key options for the technical environment, project management needs to consider: 
<ul>
    <li>
        The state-of-the-art in terms of technologies available in the marketplace as well as proven practices used by
        similar projects.
    </li>
    <li>
        The sharing of the technical environment with another project or sub-project to save cost and to enhance the return
        on shared investment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any pre-existing commitments between the sponsor and the delivery organization for the use of specific standards or
        tools, and any knowledge about their use acquired during the shaping of the project.
    </li>
</ul><br />
Because this process provides descriptions of quality contributors, it interacts closely with quality planning. <br />
The following represents the steps required to define key options for Technical Environment planning: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Determine the level of automation for the technical work.<br />
        Automating technical work on a project is a significant investment. When making decisions about which aspects of
        technical work will be automated and which will remain "manual", the levels of activity and quality required by the
        project to be major considerations when developing a justification for the automation investment.<br />
        Here is the typical approach for determining the level of automation: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identify project activities that could be supported by technical environment resources, given the requested
                approach or methods, tools and standards, and team organization (for example, consistency checking that
                could be automated).
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider alternative approaches (more or less automation balanced by more or less centralization or
                decentralization of assessment activities, tailoring of work, cross reviews, additional procedures and so
                on).
            </li>
            <li>
                Choose among alternatives.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Define standards and tools.<br />
        Defining standards and tools is necessary to ensure that: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Extensions created for the project are compatible with the hardware and software already in place (if any),
                or other directions given by the sponsor.
            </li>
            <li>
                All participants on the project (team, sponsor, and subcontractors) can communicate to ensure effective
                collaboration.
            </li>
        </ul>The following is a typical approach: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Begin by recognizing obvious choices or existing and reusable standards, tools and/or software for the: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Local area network
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Operating systems for the servers and the workstations
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>These operating systems generally are closely linked to requirements for the deliverables themselves 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Continue by making choices and searching for reusable assets for: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Office suite and office communication tools
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tools to support project management work, including tools for project scheduling and tools to
                        support business processes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tools to support technical work (for example lower and upper CASE tools in application development
                        and so on )
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standards for accessing remote systems
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Check the compatibility of options that exist among the choices available with a technical expert.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take into account cost and property rights (royalties) concerns when choosing standards and tools such as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A tool may be inexpensive but consume a large amount of resources when it is run
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A tool may be inexpensive for development purposes but then become mandatory for running the
                        deliverables, resulting in additional and perhaps unacceptable expenses or licensing issues when
                        deployed on final user workstations
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        For projects that will run for some time, define a policy for upgrading the technical environment as
        required.<br />
        This policy will be used when considering upgrades to new versions of the tools that are released to the
        market.<br />
        Benefits, drawbacks and risks related to changing the technical environment during the course of the project to be
        closely analyzed before making a decision.
    </li>
    <li>
        Investigate the possibilities of sharing technical environments. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consider sharing the technical environment, or parts of it, with another project. It might be necessary to
                adapt some of the key options or to accept the vision, and therefore the key options, of another project,
                if the potential cost savings outweighs the risk of not adapting or updating. An example will be accepting
                a lower level of automation, knowing that the cost of the additional manual effort is less than the cost of
                purchasing a new, fully-automated&nbsp;project repository.
            </li>
            <li>
                Invite other projects to consider sharing your project's ideal environment. The cost of everyone's manual
                efforts might be more than purchasing a new project repository that can be shared.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the risks related to the key options.<br />
        Risks are mainly triggered by the newness and complexity of the technology (although new technologies may be
        required to support features critical for the client). Some of the key points to be noted here are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                New technologies may not be sufficiently stable to support project work.
            </li>
            <li>
                New technologies may not be available on the market when needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Obtaining support from suppliers on new technologies may be very difficult, if not impossible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combining technologies in ways that are not supported by previous experience is a major source of risk.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    1.2 Identify required features
</h2><br />
Required features are identified for each project organizational unit (POU) by considering the work they have to perform,
roles and responsibilities, and quality contributors that may be required as described in the <b><i>project
definition</i></b>.<br />
While identifying the required features, the key options defined during project definition might need expanding or
modifying. This more fully developed description of the key options is then added to the <b><i>technical environment
plan</i></b>.<br />
The following represents the steps required to identify required features for Technical Environment planning: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Agree with the technical environment architect on the form in which required features will be expressed and the
        metrics that will be provided.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each phase of the project, identify the features (use cases) required from the technical environment by
        reviewing the key options for the technical environment, along with work to be performed, roles and
        responsibilities, and quality contributors that may be required, as described in the project definition.<br />
        Typical features could be as follows: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Office suite such as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spreadsheet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Word processor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Presentation and/or drawing tools
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Office communications such as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Mail and access to shared office suite files
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Project management areas such as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Management and operational scheduling
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time tracking
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cost tracking
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Risk management
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Project control book (PCB)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Access to business systems
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Technical areas such as:

                    <li>
                        Identify features that are in support of or are required by the methodology adopted by the project

                    <li>
                        Indicate which features to be isolated from or integrated with the others.<br />
                        For example, upper and lower CASE features may need to be integrated, while planning and tracking
                        functions may need to be interfaced with business systems
                    </li>

    <li>
        For each phase of the project, identify the types of users. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Establish a typology of the users according to the sets of features that they need.<br />
                Certain users just need office suite features; others need office suite as well as project management
                features; still others might need only development or testing features.
            </li>
            <li>
                Count the number of users for each type.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        For each phase of the project, identify the sets of files (data or code) that will be handled and estimate their
        volume. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                When doing this, take into account the need for maintaining several versions of the files due to work in
                progress, configuration management, and archiving requirements.<br />
                Sets of files to be considered include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Individual and shared office suite files
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pay special attention to the volume of graphical data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Messages
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Individual and shared technical files
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Indicate the need for isolating certain sets of files from other sets of files. For example,
                        development and test files generally be isolated, which typically means double the volume of files
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Individual and shared files for project management
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        For each phase of the project, quantify calls to the key features.<br />
        For example, determine the number of users (team members) who will compile simultaneously (such as call to the
        compiling feature) for an application development phase.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each phase of the project, describe the need for group work, information sharing capabilities, accessibility of
        the systems (local and remote), security at different levels of project organization, and printing capabilities for
        the group.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each phase of the project, define the expected level of service.<br />
        This definition typically includes: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Days and hours in the day when the technical environment to be available.
            </li>
            <li>
                Response time for batch and on-line processing.<br />
                Take into account special needs such as availability of the technical environment at night to perform
                specific testing.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        At the top level of the project, aggregate required features for all Project Organizational Units (POUs) and
        document them in the technical environment plan.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    1.3 Describe overall architecture
</h2><br />
The purpose of this activity is to obtain an overall design showing the different components that might have to be built or
bought to create the technical environment in which the project will work. <br />
The technical environment consists not only of tools, but also of processes and methods. Beyond the technical methods that
are already provided by your constituency, it may be necessary to create specific processes for the project and these to be
included in the technical environment plan. <br />
The following represents the steps required to describe overall architecture for Technical Environment planning: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Monitor the progress of the technical, application, and process architecture schema along with their descriptions.
        These will be developed to support the required features documented in the technical environment plan.<br />
        Technical and application architecture schemas are based on a classification of workstations and potentially, a
        classification of servers. These classifications take into account the types of users, feature sets, and sets of
        files defined when describing required features.<br />
        The descriptions of the technical and application schema should reference specific pieces of hardware or software
        (with an indication of version numbers), their characteristics (size information, for example), and relationships
        to other technical environment components. Requirements to be included for components to be built such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The hardware architecture schema describes elements of equipment, which are the nodes and connections
                (machines, cards, peripherals, so on) that make up the network of interconnected machines.
            </li>
            <li>
                The software architecture schema describes the basic software installed on the hardware architecture:
                operating system(s), communication software, database management system, transactional monitors, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                The application architecture schema describes the implementation of the tools on the technical architecture
                from the point of view of the features that are required.
            </li>
        </ul>The processes are specific ways of working to contribute to the expected outcomes of the project. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The process architecture schema for the technical environment plan must identify these processes and the
                components of their descriptions (for example, activities, tasks, work products, guidelines).<br />
                When possible, the architecture schema to be compared with existing intellectual capital to make the best
                use of the reusable assets.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the proposed architecture complies with standards required by key options for the technical environment
        and request for proposal or project quality plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the proposed architecture complies with required features.<br />
        For each type of user, think through the way in which the software (specific tools, local area network,
        communication server, and so on) and hardware layers will meet the required features defined for the technical
        environment.<br />
        Pay special attention to determining whether features are being effectively integrated on workstations for each
        type of user.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the proposed architecture is optimal with regard to the following: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sizing of computer storage capacities (processors, memory, disks). Sizing of the technical environment must
                comply with specific requirements of the tools. Decisions made here can greatly influence the productivity
                of the project in the long run.
            </li>
            <li>
                Minimization of modifications that will have to be made when moving from one project phase to another.
            </li>
            <li>
                Economical sharing of printing resources; for example, assuring easy access to printing resources based on
                the locations of users.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Check security aspects such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Back-up features and storage capacities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Recovery features.
            </li>
            <li>
                Accessibility based on roles and responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Availability of technical environment components, support services, and spare parts.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Check the potential for patenting of innovative components of the technical architecture. If patentable components
        are identified, handle those components as deliverables, and describe their characteristics in an associated
        deliverable definition. Also identify them in the work product list.
    </li>
    <li>
        Check that tools for administration of the technical environment are included in the technical environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the proposed level of service is satisfactory.
    </li>
    <li>
        Check overall consistency of the architecture, if it was assembled from required features created by separate
        POUs.<br />
        Pay special attention to communication and interface capabilities and the economical sharing of resources. Review
        the architecture schemas of other project organizational units (POUs) in the program or project to validate that
        your proposed architecture is sharing resources wherever possible.

<h2>
    2. Technical Environment Implementation
</h2><br />
This process is used in a simplified way for implementing the project start-up technical environment. <br />
The following represents the steps required for Technical Environment Implementation: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Perform detailed planning for the office suite and project management tools implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pay special attention to opportunities and threats throughout this effort and adjust plans accordingly.<br />
        For example, the beginning of a new project might provide a good opportunity for implementing a new project
        management workflow scheduling application, one that has several long-awaited functions. However, if the project
        duration is short and there is not much time for training, the risk might outweigh the benefit.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document utilization rules for office suite tools, if any.
    </li>
    <li>
        Install or check installation of office suite and office communication tools on the workstations. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Check conformity with standards.
            </li>
            <li>
                Test communications.
            </li>
        </ul>Beginning to use a new workstation on a project generally requires some effort. Standards are not sufficient
        to control all the subtleties of setting parameters, particularly when workstations are used for several projects
        at the same time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document utilization rules for project management tools.<br />
        For example: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Set up guidelines for access to shared file space so that multiple people can edit the project plan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set parameters for and initialize project management tools. This includes customizing the tools to the
                project Organizational breakdown structure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Document, in the <b><i>asset inventory</i></b>, the assignment of equipment to the project staff.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    3. Technical Environment Maintenance
</h2><br />
The purpose of this activity is to maintain expected levels of performance from the technical environment throughout the
project.<br />
This is achieved through: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Assessing the effectiveness of the technical environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintaining the effectiveness of the technical environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    3.1 Assessing the effectiveness of the technical environment
</h2><br />
An effective technical environment is crucial to the success of the project. The project manager is responsible for
ensuring that the environment is performing as planned, and as required, and continues to do so throughout the life of the
project. The assessment process helps the project manager evaluate the health of the technical environment. <br />
An assessment might be required because:<br />
It had been planned to coincide with a specific point in the life of the project<br />
The project manager has been receiving complaints, issues, or compliance incidents, and so on, relating to the technical
environment<br />
The project manager's perception is that problems with the technical environment have the potential to jeopardize the
project.<br />
An assessment could be brief and informal when there are only a few people and components involved, or it could be
extensive, requiring the involvement of many people, supporting documentation, and a significant amount of investigation
and tracking. <br />
The following represents the steps required for assessing the effectiveness of the technical environment for technical
environment maintenance: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Define the scope of the assessment such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                An assessment is required of the entire technical environment.<br />
                This type of assessment might be done when a new technical environment has been installed and the project
                has reached the point where it is now fully operational and fully staffed. The requirement for doing this
                might have been documented in the technical environment plan.<br />
                Another option is to do a general assessment when it is suspected that the environment is jeopardizing the
                project, but it is unclear as to which area is the source of the problem.<br />
                Or<br />
                An assessment is required of only a particular area, such as the project workflow scheduler, or a
                particular characteristic of the technical environment, such as the response time across many areas.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the approach such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Determine if a formal assessment meeting is required or whether the assessment can be done by less formal
                means.
            </li>
            <li>
                Decide who will be involved. If there will be a meeting, decide who should be invited. There may be a need
                to invite people from outside the project team, such as support people who have the technical skills that
                the project manager might not have.
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine whether additional documentation needs to be gathered before the meeting.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Before the assessment meeting, investigate and gather supporting documentation, if required and available. Examples
        of documentation might include issue documents, compliance incidents, system outage logs, and notes from project
        team members.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct the assessment.The steps to be followed are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Define the problem as completely as possible.<br />
                Find the real problem underlying the initial concern. For example, project team members complained about
                randomly not being able to read certain files sent through the e-mail system or stored in a repository.
                After discussion, the team realized that they could not read files sent by people using a different
                operating system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine the impact on the project. The schedule or the quality of the deliverable might be in jeopardy
                because of the inability to read documents critical to the success of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify the source of the problem, if possible.<br />
                The project team might not be able to do this step without help. In the case of the incompatible files, for
                example, team at first thought the problem was caused by the mix of operating systems. But after analysis
                by a technical support person, it was determined that the problem was a down-level version of one of the
                e-mail products.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design a solution, if possible.<br />
                This might not be in the area of responsibility of the project management team, but if the team has ideas
                for a solution, develop them, as time allows, and then propose them to the responsible area. For example,
                the team proposed that technical support develops and distributes a procedure for upgrading the e-mail
                application.
            </li>
            <li>
                Define a temporary solution, if possible. For example, the project manager sent out and stored the
                documents in both formats until all the upgrades were done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify the person, role, or organization responsible for solving the problem, if possible. When not
                possible, identify who can further define the problem and its cause so that it can be assigned to the
                correct function.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the findings and subsequent actions, if required, in the technical environment assessment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create additional documents, as required, such as risk definition, compliance incident document, issue document,
        change request, or any documents required by groups outside the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document follow-up activities in the technical environment assessment. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reference any additional documents.
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine if and when another assessment is required to ensure that the improvements have been effective.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    3.2 Maintaining the effectiveness of the technical environment
</h2><br />
This process addresses the need for continuous improvement to the technical environment. Project team members, including
the project manager, and technical support personnel look for ways to improve the environment; project management must then
decide if implementation of the improvement is feasible. <br />
The following represents the steps required for maintaining the effectiveness of the technical environment for technical
environment maintenance: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Collect or solicit, suggested improvements to the technical environment and its utilization rules, based on
        requests from the teams and performance statistics. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Carefully balance the benefits of changes or additions to the technical environment against related
                risks.<br />
                Any change that has been determined to be necessary and appropriate should be planned carefully. Pay
                special attention to communications between users during the migration phase and data conversion
                necessitated by the change.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintain control of developments undertaken by project staff to simplify or enhance the use of the office suite and
        other tools; for example, "home-grown" macros to automate activities.<br />
        Control the time spent on such activities, the reliability of results, and management of versions disseminated
        among the teams.
    </li>
    <li>
        Re-size or re-deploy the technical environment, as required based on resource consumption statistics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Launch additional support actions such as training, as required based on requests from the teams and performance
        statistics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask users to change behavior, as required based on analysis of performance statistics.<br />
        Changes in behavior include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Exercising better "clean-up discipline".
            </li>
            <li>
                Making adequate use of batch and on-line features.
            </li>
            <li>
                Thinking through work more carefully before calling for automated checks.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Manage services provided by suppliers to maintain control of the budget.
    </li>
    <li>
        Update the asset inventory based on arrivals and departures of staff, the start of new phases, office moves and so
        on.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    4. Technical Environment Removal
</h2><br />
The purpose of this activity is to oversee the de-installation of technical environment components from workstations when
people leave the project, and from the common platform at the end of the project. <br />
This includes the following tasks: 
<ul>
    <li>
        De-installing workstations.
    </li>
    <li>
        De-installing the common technical environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    4.1 De-installing workstations
</h2><br />
The following represents the steps required for De-installing workstations for technical environment removal: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Each time a person leaves the project (or it becomes necessary to re-deploy workstations): 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Review the inventory to identify the components that have been installed by the project on the person's
                workstation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Review the agreement to understand disposition requirements for these components.
            </li>
            <li>
                Collect reusable office suite developments and utilization ideas in order to provide them to the
                intellectual capital management focal point.
            </li>
            <li>
                Save or archive project files, as appropriate; transfer files to other team members, as required.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check that the departing person cleans up the common storage areas that he/she has been using.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check that all the data has been deleted from the workstation.
            </li>
            <li>
                De-install software that are returned to the project, following the manufacturer's guidelines.
            </li>
            <li>
                Collect software and hardware components that have been allocated to the person for the duration of the
                project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep components for redeployment or return them to the sponsor or other owner, as appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Record official return to the sponsor or other owner.
            </li>
            <li>
                Delete access authorizations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Update the inventory.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    4.2 De-installing the common technical environment
</h2><br />
It is important to sequence the de-installation of the common technical environment to allow for any remaining project
activities that need to be completed; for example, there may be back-up or printing needs up to the last minute. <br />
The following represents the steps required for De-installing the common technical environment for technical environment
removal: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Review the asset inventory and the agreement to understand disposition requirements for technical environment
        components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Collect reusable ideas and developments in order to provide them to the intellectual capital management focal
        point.
    </li>
    <li>
        Back up files as required such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Archive the project control book (PCB) as required by constituency policies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure that technical files, such as the product itself, have been archived.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Clean up the common storage space.<br />
        When the technical environment is embedded in a complex environment, this is a tricky activity unless directories
        have been prepared from the start of the project with this "clean up" in mind.
    </li>
    <li>
        De-install the software following the manufacturer's guidelines and return it to the sponsor or other owner, as
        appropriate. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Record official return to the sponsor or other owner.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        De-install hardware following the manufacturer's guidelines and return it to the sponsor or other owner, as
        appropriate.<br />
        This may require hardware to be moved. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Record official return to the sponsor or other owner.
            </li>
        </ul>
