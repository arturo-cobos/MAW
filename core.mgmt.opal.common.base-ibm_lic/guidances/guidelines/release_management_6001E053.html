<h2>
    Details

<h2>
    1. Verifying Completion of Construction for the Release
</h2><br />
A planned release consists of all new or changed software and hardware required to implement the approved changes. The
<b><i>release plan</i></b> includes all of the release details, including the completion criteria. <br />
At predetermined times, the Technical Team Leader verifies the completion of the construction for the release, based on the
category and definition of the release. Releases are categorized, based on the following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Work involved in construction: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Major software releases</b>: Consists of major units of new functionality, some of which may make the
                preceding problem fixes redundant.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Minor software releases</b>: Consists of minor enhancements or fixes, some of which may make the
                preceding emergency fixes redundant.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Emergency software or hardware fixes</b>: Consists of corrections to a small number of known problems.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Components included in the release: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Full Application Release</b>: All application components are released together for implementation,
                irrespective of whether they underwent a change since the previous release. Such releases ensure the whole
                application (changed and unchanged components) is built, tested, distributed and implemented together.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Partial Application Release</b>: Only those application components that have actually changed or are new
                since the last release are released.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Integrated Package Release</b>: All changes across application domains are grouped together and released
                as a 'package'. Such releases are especially useful where the changes to a system or an application may
                require changes to other systems or applications. Since these changes are made together, they are included
                in the same package for release.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul><br />
The Technical Team Leader checks the following to verify the construction planned for the release is complete: 
<ul>
    <li>
        The work is constructed as per the <b><i>service request</i></b> or <b><i>project plan for macro
        design</i></b>/<b><i>project plan for micro design</i></b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The work is unit tested in the Construction Environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b><i>data migration plan</i></b> is created for migrating the work from the construction environment to the
        test or production environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b><i>release plan</i></b> is updated appropriately.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    2. Designing, Building and Configuring the Release
</h2><br />
After the Technical Team Leader verifies the construction for the release is complete, all the software and/or hardware
components, which comprise the release, are required to be assembled in a controlled manner to ensure a reproducible
process. <br />
For software, the standard approach is to receive the new or changed source code from the Developers and generate the
executables using controlled procedures on dedicated build hardware. This process is called Build Management and is one of
the core activities in Release Management. Build management becomes the responsibility of Release Management from the final
release entry date onwards. <br />
The instructions to build or to assemble a release are considered part of the definition of the release. It is quite common
to write scripts to automate the installation of systems and application software onto servers and workstations. Depending
on the implementation plan, this can be performed in advance (for example, if hardware is being replaced) or can be
performed directly in the production environment. <br />
The Technical Team Leader plans and documents the procedure for building software releases by reusing standard procedures,
wherever possible. A configuration of a particular release of software and hardware may be based upon a set of available
components, some of which may be developed in-house and others bought in. <br />
All software, parameters, test data, run-time software, and any other software, which is required for the release, are
placed under configuration management control. A complete record of the build results is logged so that a build can be
repeated, if necessary. <br />
Design, build, and configuration of the release are done based on the <b><i>release plan</i></b> of the project. The
outputs of this activity are assembled into the <b><i>physical packaging</i></b> and may include the following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Detailed release assembly and build instructions, including the exact sequence of operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Purchase orders, licenses and warranties for third-party software and hardware.
    </li>
    <li>
        Automated installation scripts and associated <b><i>detailed test plan</i></b>(s).
    </li>
    <li>
        Master copies of the installation media and installation instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Back-out procedures to document the actions to be taken to restore the service to rollout a release fail, either
        partially or totally.
    </li>
    <li>
        Updated <b><i>data migration plan</i></b>(s).
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    3. Preparing Test Environment and Planning Migration
</h2><br />
The Test Team Leader prepares the test environment for upcoming migrations from the construction environment to the test
environment on an ongoing basis, as necessary. <br />
Upon receiving notification from the Technical Team Leader regarding completion of the build for the release, the Test Team
Leader creates the appropriate <b><i>data migration plan</i></b> based on the approved <b><i>service request</i></b>
identifying the following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Delivery package and migration category such as daily, weekly or on-request migration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Release information, type of transport (manual or automated), source construction environment, and all target
        environments and dates.
    </li>
</ul><br />
The Test Team Leader reviews the <b><i>data</i></b> <b><i>migration plan</i></b> with the relevant stakeholders, obtaining
any necessary approvals. 
<h2>
    4. Migrating to Test Environment for Integrated Testing
</h2><br />
Release Management includes integrated testing of multiple changes at once for early detection of cross-process conflicts
and to minimize system disruption. The Test Team Leader performs the following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Migrates all the work from the construction to the prepared test environment to facilitate commencement of
        integrated testing using either a manual or automated transport mechanism.
    </li>
    <li>
        Updates the appropriate <b><i>data</i></b> <b><i>migration plan</i></b> with details including the date of
        migration to the testing environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    5. Verifying Completion of Integrated Testing for the Release
</h2><br />
The Test Team Leader checks the following to verify testing is completed for the planned release: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Integrated testing is complete in the test environment and results are documented in the appropriate <b><i>test
        report</i></b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Regression testing is complete in the test environment and results are documented in the appropriate
        <em><strong>test report.</strong></em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Critical process testing is complete in the test environment and results are documented in the appropriate
        <b><i>test report</i></b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Client acceptance testing is complete in the test environment and results are documented in the appropriate
        <b><i>test report</i></b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Test Team Leader notifies the Technical Team Leader of the successful completion of the testing effort.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    6. Promoting to Production Environment
</h2><br />
After receiving the notification from the Test Team Leader regarding the completion of testing for the release, the
Technical Team Leader performs the following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Migrates all the work from the construction to the production environment using the management approved manual or
        automated transport mechanism. Automated transport systems require close monitoring of migrations to prevent
        incomplete code from migrating.
    </li>
    <li>
        Updates the <b><i>data</i></b> <b><i>migration plan</i></b> with all of the pertinent details, including the final
        date of migration to the production environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    7. Confirming Changes in Production Environment and Notifying Client
</h2><br />
After promoting the work from the construction to the production environment, the Technical Team Leader performs the
following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Reviews the production changes to confirm all required changes have been successfully migrated into the production
        environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Notifies the stakeholders of the successful move into the production environment of the approved changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Closes the <b><i>service request</i></b>, if applicable.
    </li>
</ul>
