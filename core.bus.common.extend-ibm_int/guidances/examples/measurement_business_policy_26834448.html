    The following is a sample set of policies supporting measurement implementation:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Human Resources Category</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Percent Subcontractor Labor Hours:</strong> All subcontractors will be required to claim their labor
        hours.&nbsp; For any fixed price contracts with contractors, dollars are to be converted to labor hours.&nbsp; ($65
        = 1 labor hour)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Quality Category</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Project Defects per Function Point:</strong> Root cause analysis must be performed to determine if the
        defect was introduced by the development project against which the defect is being logged.&nbsp; Analysis must also
        be performed to ensure the defect is valid and unique.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>System Availability:</strong> Root cause analysis must be performed to determine the cause of interrupted
        service.&nbsp; Only interruptions caused by application defects should be counted for this measurement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Cost and Schedule Category</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Project Completion Date Variance:</strong> A project is only considered complete if both the IBM Business
        office and &lt;Client&gt;’s Business office have both signed-off on the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; The completion date
        specified on the sign-off sheet will be used for purposes of this measurement.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Customer Category</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Percent Transition Milestones Met:</strong> IBM and &lt;Client&gt; will jointly select the key milestones
        to be met, and the quality standards around these milestones.&nbsp; These milestones and their quality attributes
        will be documented as part of the quality review process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Process Category</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Project Manager Capability:</strong> This metric includes any personnel classified by CERIS as a Project
        Manager.&nbsp; A project manager is considered certified if they are PMP certified or IBM certified.&nbsp; It does
        not include subcontractors.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Productivity and Output Category</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Function Points Maintained per Labor Hour:</strong> Function Point counting is to be conducted using IFPUG
        4.1 standards.&nbsp; Only “active” applications will be considered part of this measurement where “active” is
        defined as having greater than 1 person month of effort applied to the maintenance of the application.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Function Points Developed per Labor Hour:</strong> Function Point counting is to be conducted using IFPUG
        4.1 standards.&nbsp; This measure should capture the total effort in labor hours starting with design through
        project closure.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Measurement Implementation Policy (Governance) Plan</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The example below shows a process to be followed for collecting the required data for the scorecard in an automated
    fashion from CLAIM, a Help Desk system, or any other data collection facilities. It is important that the days and
    months are specified, so that each month the process is repeatable and stable.
</p>
<p>
    In this example, the data required for the scorecard is collected in an automated fashion from Claim, and Help desk
    system.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, some data is collected manually by a business office on spreadsheets.&nbsp; All of the
    data for the performance period needs to be input into the appropriate system or spreadsheet by the end of the “agreed
    to” business day of the following month.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the “agreed to” business day of the month following the
    performance period being measured, the data is pulled into the measurement data repository and the scorecard is
    produced and reviewed for calculation related errors.&nbsp; Once the scorecard has passed the technical review it is
    passed to the governance team to perform a business review of the data.&nbsp; This process is depicted in the chart
    below.

</p>
<p>
    <br />
    <strong>Audit Considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A documented change request process and form must be used in order to ensure the integrity of the data in the scorecard
    and in the scorecard reports.&nbsp; Work items may not be randomly added unless this process is followed and
    documented.&nbsp; This results in the creation of an audit trail.<br />
    Below is an example of a form that might be used.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Measurement Change Request (MCR)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A short description of the requested addition or change should be listed as the subject of the MCR.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    requestor will forward the MCR to the appropriate person for review and approval.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.&nbsp;Person Initiating the MCR:</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
