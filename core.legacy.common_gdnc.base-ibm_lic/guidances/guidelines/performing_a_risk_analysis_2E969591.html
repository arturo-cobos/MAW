    The Controller’s Division is not immune from the business pressures that are causing organizations to undertake
    numerous performance improvement projects.&nbsp; These projects may take a variety of forms: reengineering, systems
    enhancement, and reorganization, to name a few. In addition to these potential changes, the Controller’s Division
    frequently lends its expertise to other projects within the company through a variety of roles, such as providing
    financial analysis and participating on project teams.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in many companies, management is frequently
    disappointed with project results because these results often fall far below original expectations. Although the
    reasons for these failures vary, there is one common denominator: earlier in the life of the project, these reasons
    were risks to the project.
</p>Over the past few years, many organizations have concentrated on building the specialized skills and defined methods
that are necessary to effectively manage projects. In their processes and procedures for project management, it is common
for companies to carefully track and manage the issues that have begun to negatively impact the project. However, it is
important that these processes and procedures be augmented by an effective process for identifying and addressing project
risks <b><u>before</u></b> these risks become issues. Most of the issues that arise on projects could have been foreseen,
and probably were anticipated by one or more people close to the project. Fully leveraging this early foresight offers the
project team a variety of options. For example, priorities or schedules may be changed, key decisions may be escalated to
higher levels of management, activities may be added or enhanced, and additional (or different) resources may be obtained.
For these reasons, it is valuable to include an approach for managing project risks in the overall project management
process.

    Project risk management is a method for addressing project risks in a proactive manner. In addition to reducing the
    overall risk of projects, project risk management benefits projects in other ways by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensuring that project plans are realistic, with corresponding improvements in the overall business case and
        definition of project net benefits;
    </li>
    <li>
        Enhancing management’s understanding of the project’s implications during the early stages of the project, which
        can reduce unwelcome surprises and perhaps even lead to an appropriate "no go" decision before significant
        resources are wasted;
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing the opportunity to identify and consider a broader range of options than may be possible when the risk
        has become an issue, which can conserve resources; and
    </li>
    <li>
        Allowing more time to be made available to address the risks in a careful and well-planned manner.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This chapter describes a framework that companies can use to identify and manage project risks at the earliest possible
    stage in the life of a project.
</p>
<h3>
    Project Risk Categories
</h3>
<p>
    Before beginning the process of managing project risk, it is important to understand the distinction between issues and
    risks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Issue:</u>&nbsp; A current problem that is negatively impacting a project.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Risk:</u>&nbsp; A possible occurrence that would expose a project to potential failure in some or all respects.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In some instances, a risk is an issue that will happen in the future.&nbsp; However, not all project risks become
    issues.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to understanding the distinction between issues and risks, categorizing project risks can be valuable in
    assisting a project team to identify and consider the potential risks the project may face.&nbsp; Four categories of
    common project risks are project management risks, technical risks, human risks, and business risks.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Project Management Risks:</u>&nbsp; potential for unmet requirements in areas such as project management
        capabilities, project planning, and resource requirements.&nbsp; Some examples of project management risks include:
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Inadequate project management processes, procedures, or skills
            </li>
            <li>
                Incomplete planning assumptions
            </li>
            <li>
                Overly aggressive time, budget, or benefits estimates
            </li>
            <li>
                Inadequate project resource commitments (e.g., departmental representation, participation of individuals
                with key knowledge or skills, percentage of time, dates of availability)
            </li>
            <li>
                Resource coordination difficulties (e.g., geographical distances)
            </li>
            <li>
                Failure to coordinate intraproject linkages and relationships<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Technical Risks:</u>&nbsp; potential for unmet requirements in terms of project designs, delivery schedules,
        information availability, and the like.&nbsp; Some examples of technical risks include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Inadequate definition of future state requirements
            </li>
            <li>
                Designs that do not address the full scope of objectives
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Hardware or software incompatibility
            </li>
            <li>
                Design incompatibility between interdependent project components
            </li>
            <li>
                Missed delivery schedules
            </li>
            <li>
                Scheduling problems between interdependent project components<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Human Risks:</u>&nbsp; potential for various human dynamics to impede project objectives, or to reduce or negate
        benefits.&nbsp; Some examples of human risks include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sponsorship that is inadequate to legitimize and sustain the project
            </li>
            <li>
                Inadequate support from middle or lower levels of management
            </li>
            <li>
                Differing or inadequate motivation toward the project or specific components of the project
            </li>
            <li>
                Differing or unclear understanding about the project scope or impacts
            </li>
            <li>
                Inadequate or ineffective communication
            </li>
            <li>
                Incompatibility between the project and facets of the existing organizational culture
            </li>
            <li>
                Lack of alignment between project requirements and facets of the existing management support structure
                (e.g., performance measurement, compensation and rewards practices, organization structure)
            </li>
            <li>
                Ineffective anticipation and management of resistance
            </li>
            <li>
                Project overload (e.g., too many projects running concurrently, too little time since another difficult
                project)
            </li>
            <li>
                Residual issues from previous project implementations (e.g., expectations that the current project will
                fail because previous attempts have also failed, unresolved conflict between departments or key
                individuals)
            </li>
            <li>
                Changes in key sponsors or project personnel during the life of the project<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Business Risks:</u>&nbsp; potential for occurrences external to the organization, or in other parts of the
        organization, that could negatively impact the project.&nbsp; Frequently, these risks fall outside the control of
        the project team.&nbsp; Some examples of business risks are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Strikes
            </li>
            <li>
                Competitor actions
            </li>
            <li>
                Legislative or regulatory changes
            </li>
            <li>
                Significant problems or opportunities that redirect executive attention and/or funding
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These project risk categories and examples are not intended to be an exhaustive listing, but rather an illustration of
    the various types of risks that projects face.&nbsp; In implementing project risk management, it may be valuable for
    each company to develop categories, descriptions, and examples that are specifically applicable to itself and its
    project experiences.
</p>
<h3>
    Project Risk Management Approach
</h3>
<p>
    Project risk management is an iterative process and should be directly tied into the process for managing and tracking
    issues throughout the life of the project.&nbsp; An effective approach for managing project risks involves several
    steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify the risks that are relevant to the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluate the risks to determine which risks deserve the most attention.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assign people to “own” the key risks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Address the key risks through Containment or Contingency Plans (prepared before the risk becomes an issue to the
        project).
    </li>
    <li>
        Revisit the project plan for adjustment or enhancement if the plan has already been prepared.
    </li>
    <li>
        Manage and track the risks throughout the life of the project.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Project Risk Management Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <img height="232" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.base-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/projectmanagementapproach.JPG" width="236" />
</p>
<p>
    Risk management is especially important during the initial stages of a project.&nbsp; However, it is appropriate to
    consider project risks at other times as well, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        After achievement of key project milestones
    </li>
    <li>
        Before beginning new project phases
    </li>
    <li>
        When relevant information is received (e.g., knowledge about changes in business conditions, announcement of
        organizational changes, announcement or discussion about changes in a project sponsor or project member)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If a project is underway and its risks have not been identified and evaluated, it is advisable to begin the risk
    management process without delay.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 1:&nbsp; Identify the Relevant Risks
</h4>
<p>
    When identifying risks, it is valuable to brainstorm and consider a wide variety of potential negative impacts to the
    project.&nbsp; The best approach to identifying risks depends on the size and importance of a project.&nbsp; In some
    cases, facilitated sessions are warranted.&nbsp; In other cases, it may be appropriate to seek input in writing.&nbsp;
    However, in all circumstances, it is beneficial to seek contribution from a variety of sources.&nbsp; Key contributors
    to this process may include project sponsors, project team members, and people with related expertise or experiences.
</p>
<p>
    In preparing to identify project risks, a few prerequisites are necessary:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The project objectives must be clear
    </li>
    <li>
        Proposed targets for schedule, budget, and resource requirements need to be understood
    </li>
    <li>
        Other relevant information should be understood, such as:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implementation history for similar projects
            </li>
            <li>
                Planning assumptions
            </li>
            <li>
                Dependencies with related projects and/or other parts of the business
            </li>
            <li>
                Project organization, and roles and responsibilities
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After these prerequisites have been met, the first activity in the project risk management process is to develop a list
    of relevant project risks.&nbsp; Depending on the nature and size of the project, a variety of methods exist for
    developing this list, such as ad hoc requests or surveys.&nbsp; If the project warrants a facilitated session, it is
    helpful to collect a draft list of risks prior to holding the session.&nbsp; Once the essence of each risk has been
    identified, risk statements should be developed.&nbsp; Examples of risk statements for each category of risk are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Project Management Risk:</u>&nbsp; “There is a risk that key individuals will be pulled from the project too
        soon to complete some of the reporting refinements.”
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Technical Risk:</u>&nbsp; “There is a risk that the pricing module will be delayed, and that this delay will
        impede the ability to begin the new marketing programs as scheduled.”
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Human Risk:</u>&nbsp; “There is a risk that users will reject report formats and schedules.”
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Business Risk:</u>&nbsp; “There is a risk that funding may be jeopardized by problems in manufacturing.”
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    During this first step, it may be valuable to use the risk categories to prompt the contributors to consider additional
    areas.&nbsp; Also, it may be helpful to encourage contributors to review the inputs of others.&nbsp; However, it is
    important to note that the objective of this step is to create a list of relevant risks that should be tracked and
    managed.&nbsp; When the contributors believe that the list contains these relevant risks, it is time to move on to the
    next step in the process.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2:&nbsp; Evaluate the Risks
</h4>
<p>
    The second step involves evaluating the risks in preparation for taking appropriate actions.&nbsp; Depending on the
    nature of the project and the culture of the organization, this step may involve the entire project team or may be
    designated to specific sponsors and project team personnel only.
</p>
<p>
    There are several ways to evaluate the list of project risks.&nbsp; Some ways are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        By&nbsp;the probability of occurrence
    </li>
    <li>
        By the potential for negative impact to the project, in terms of: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Unmet project objectives
            </li>
            <li>
                Missed schedules
            </li>
            <li>
                Budget overruns<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        By the degree to which the project team is able to control the risk or take action to reduce the probability and/or
        impact of that risk
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The first step in evaluating project risks involves determining which risks warrant the most attention.&nbsp; This step
    involves analyzing each risk on two dimensions.&nbsp; The first dimension is the probability of that risk
    occurring.&nbsp; The second dimension is the potential for negative impact if the risk were to become an issue.&nbsp;
    These two dimensions can be plotted onto a matrix to determine the overall severity of each risk, as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <img height="333" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.base-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/degreeofriskseverity.JPG" width="417" /><br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    The second evaluation step involves identifying the appropriate manner in which to address the risks, which is the
    subject of Step 4 in the project risk management process.&nbsp; The severity of each risk is an important element in
    making this evaluation.&nbsp; The second element involves the degree to which action can be taken on that risk.&nbsp;
    Although the project team may not have direct control over the risk, it is often possible for tasks to be undertaken
    that will reduce the probability of occurrence and/or decrease the negative impact if the risk becomes an issue.&nbsp;
    For some risks, however, there are no actions that are appropriate prior to the occurrence of the issue.&nbsp;An
    example of a nonactionable risk may be the risk of losing resources and momentum due to the possibility of a
    strike.&nbsp; In this case, the potential for a strike may be out of the control of the project team, and it is likely
    that no direct actions are appropriate unless the strike does occur.
</p>
<p>
    In identifying the appropriate manner in which to address the risks, another matrix may be valuable.&nbsp; This matrix
    evaluates risk severity against the degree to which action may be taken:<br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    <img height="333" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.base-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/risk_management_actions.JPG" width="432" />
</p>
<p>
    Containment Plans include actions that will be taken, and consequently need to be included in the overall project
    plan.&nbsp; Contingency Plans are preparations for actions to be taken in the event that a key nonactionable risk
    becomes an issue.&nbsp; The Tracking List is a mechanism to document the identified risks for monitoring and future
    consideration. The actions identified through the use of this matrix guide the actions to be taken in Step 4 of the
    project risk management approach.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3:&nbsp; Assign Risk Owners
</h4>
<p>
    By this step in the risk management process, the key risks for the project are known and understood, so it is an
    opportunity to assign a person to “own” each key risk.&nbsp; This helps to ensure that the key risks are managed and
    tracked adequately.&nbsp; For very high and high severity risks, risk owners are necessary.&nbsp; Also, depending on
    the importance of the project, it may be valuable to assign owners to risks that are moderately severe.
</p>
<p>
    Risk owners are accountable for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Preparing the Containment or Contingency Plans;
    </li>
    <li>
        Monitoring changes in the probability and/or impact of the risk, and notifying the project manager and team of any
        significant changes; and
    </li>
    <li>
        Taking the lead in initiating and managing the Containment or Contingency Plans, as appropriate.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The risk owner may look to others for assistance with these activities, especially if it is deemed appropriate for one
    individual to own several risks.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4:&nbsp; Address Key Risks
</h4>
<p>
    At this point in the process, the actions appropriate for each risk begin.&nbsp; The Risk Management Actions matrix
    from Step 2 showed three types of actions for the project team to undertake:
</p>
<p>
    <u>Containment Plans:</u>&nbsp; These plans involve specific actions that will be taken to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reduce the probability of the risk turning into an issue
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduce the negative impact to the project if the risk becomes an issue
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Containment Plans might include the following types of actions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Negotiating firm commitments for individuals with critical knowledge or expertise
    </li>
    <li>
        Involving additional (or different) people in important roles, activities, or pivotal decisions
    </li>
    <li>
        Lengthening schedules for certain activities
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtaining additional budget and/or time to expand the scope to address important linkages between project
        components or among related projects
    </li>
    <li>
        Narrowing the project scope to make the project more manageable
    </li>
    <li>
        Enhancing communication activities
    </li>
    <li>
        Adding education and follow-up support mechanisms to existing plans for training (e.g., mentoring, “chalk talks,”
        single subject short courses)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u>Contingency Plans</u>:&nbsp; These plans involve preparation for actions to be taken in the event that a
    nonactionable risk becomes an issue.&nbsp; Contingency Plans might include the following types of actions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identifying and preparing backup resources for critical activities or areas
    </li>
    <li>
        Distinguishing between vital project components that need to be continued and components that could be delayed with
        least overall impact to the project
    </li>
    <li>
        Purchasing insurance
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u>Tracking List:</u>&nbsp; This list is a mechanism to ensure that the identified project risks are retained and
    tracked as the project moves forward.&nbsp; Although no immediate action may be warranted, periodic review of the risks
    on the Tracking List will assist the project team in “keeping their eyes on the horizon.”&nbsp; The frequency of
    reviewing the list depends on the project, but it is valuable to specify the dates for these reviews in the project
    plan to ensure that they are not overlooked.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 5:&nbsp; Revisit the Project Plan
</h4>
<p>
    Many project plans are prepared before the project risk management process has begun.&nbsp; If this is the case, it is
    important to revisit the original project plan after the Containment and Contingency Plans have been prepared.&nbsp; A
    common problem that has been traced to many project failures stems from project plans that were unrealistic given the
    conditions. The information available at this point in the risk management process allows the original plan to be
    evaluated carefully for additional actions and trade-offs that will make the plan more achievable.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 6:&nbsp; Manage and Track the Risks
</h4>
<p>
    As the project progresses, the risks that have been identified need to be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Managed carefully in the case of risks for which Containment Plans were created;
    </li>
    <li>
        Monitored closely for indications of changes in probability and/or impact in the case of risks for which
        Contingency Plans were created; or&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Tracked for changes in probability and/or impact in the case of the remaining risks. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                If changes in the probability and/or impact of these risks increase the severity of the risk, Containment
                or Contingency Plans should be created using the same criteria employed earlier in the process.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is best to include steps to review and oversee the project risk management activities in the project plan.&nbsp; The
    frequency of these steps depends on the nature of the project.&nbsp; Projects that represent major change for the
    organization (e.g., involve significant disruption to present processes or power bases within the organization, require
    cross-functional cooperation to a greater extent than normal) will benefit from fairly frequent and close review of the
    identified risks.
</p>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    Today’s business environment is one where organizations are implementing a variety of projects.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
    many organizations are disappointed with their projects because the results often fall far below original
    expectations.&nbsp; However, it is possible to address project risks in a proactive manner and thereby reduce the
    overall riskiness of projects.
</p>
<p>
    The process for managing project risks involves several steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify the risks that are relevant to the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluate the risks to determine which risks deserve the most attention.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assign people to “own” the key risks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Address the key risks through Containment or Contingency Plans.
    </li>
    <li>
        Revisit the project plan for adjustment or enhancement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Manage and track the risks throughout the life of the project.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Effective project risk management will help to improve project plans, enhance understanding of project implications,
    and allow for additional options and time to address risks in a well-planned manner.&nbsp; All of these benefits can be
    achieved for projects of any size, scope, or difficulty, with the end result being the overall best utilization of the
    organization’s resources.<br />
