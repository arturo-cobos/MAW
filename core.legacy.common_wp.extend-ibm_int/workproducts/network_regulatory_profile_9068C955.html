    Understanding the state of wide area telecommunications services in each country leads to design recommendations with a
    realistic expectation of successful implementation. Network Regulatory Profiles help to identify and describe services
    from which the network designer can select in designing the network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    For a given country, the design is not valid if the client cannot implement it due to restrictions or limitations in
    that country.

    The following shows an example matrix. Based on engagement need, or information able to be obtained about a country’s
    telecommunications system(s) or particular telecommunications companies capabilities, the rows/columns may change
    slightly engagement by engagement.

    This matrix (for one country) is read as follows. There is a description of the country (box right under #1 - Country),
    then a brief explanation of regulatory environment (box under #2), same with major players #3. Then under the 8
    different columns representing different services (all the boxes under #4) you would express the availability of pvt
    circuits, X.25, etc. across, then same for the rest of the rows. These last 5 (#5-9) are actually attributes of
    services and need to be expressed in every matrix intersection.

    Try to select the services and characteristics to research you believe will be significant in your recommendations. You
    may find you need to research additional services or characteristics after initial data collection but before your
    recommendations are finalized. Remember that you want to make recommendations that can be implemented! If the
    requirement is to provide a service that is not available in a given country, recommending it will not assist the
    client in meeting business objectives.
</p>
<p>
    Some typical research techniques are document review, online searching and e-mail or telephone inquiries. Research
    resources include commercial data providers, international telecommunications organizations, carriers, alternative
    telecommunication providers, market research firms and trade publications.
</p>
<p>
    One commercial data provider, Lynx Technologies, collects and disseminates national and international
    telecommunications tariff information for over 350 carriers in more than 200 countries. Subscriptions to Lynx
    Technologies database can be as short as three months. In addition, the Lynx Technologies homepage provides links to
    other sources of related information on carriers, global alliances, regulatory sites, satellite sources and
    international organizations.
</p>
<p>
    The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is an international organization that provides a vehicle for
    governments and the private sector to coordinate telecommunications networks and services worldwide. This organization
    also publishes background information and statistics on member countries. The ITU is part of the United Nations. The
    ITU homepage is <a href="http://www.itu.int/"><u>http://www.itu.int</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
    Many governments use the Internet to disseminate information about their countries including telecommunications
    information. Two approaches to find government information are (1) using diplomatic links and (2) locating country
    information through hierarchical country lists. For comprehensive research, a combination of these approaches can be
    used.
</p>
<p>
    A diplomatic mission may keep a list of government Internet sites for its country or serve as a gateway to information
    from the country. In either case, finding a link to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs may provide a URL that ultimately
    leads to the telecommunications information you require. Web homepages with lists of embassies and diplomatic missions
    include:
</p>
<p>
    The Embassy Page - <a href="http://www.embpage.org/"><u>http://www.embpage.org</u></a>
</p>
<p>
    Embassy World - <a href="http://www.embassyworld.com/embassy/directory.htm"><u>http://www.embassyworld.com/embassy/directory.htm</u></a>
</p>
<p>
    Permanent Missions to the United Nations -- New York - <a href="http://www.undp.org/missions"><u>http://www.undp.org/missions</u></a>
</p>
<p>
    Permanent Missions to the United Nations -- Geneva - <a href="http://www.itu.int/OTHER/diplomatic/index.html"><u>http://www.itu.int/OTHER/diplomatic/index.html</u></a>
</p>
<p>
    Another approach to locating information about a country is using an Internet site that lists information
    geographically. Keep in mind that you will find a mix of government and non-government URLs but you probably will find
    something to start with for any country. Two useful lists are:
</p>
<p>
    Worldwide Governments on the WWW - <a href="http://www.gksoft.com/govt"><u>http://www.gksoft.com/govt</u></a>
</p>
<p>
    Yahoo - Country Links Section – <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Government/Countries"><u>http://dir.yahoo.com/Government/Countries</u></a>
</p>
<p>
    Searching by technical topic may uncover information you need. For instance, the ADSL Forum (<a href="http://www.adsl.com/"><u>http://www.adsl.com</u></a>) homepage includes information on ADSL service providers
    throughout the world.<br />
    Market research firms also examine the worldwide telecommunications infrastructure and related services. In particular,
    Datapro offers a global networking service that looks at the commercial and regulatory telecommunications environment
    in countries and regions around the world. A list of Datapro global networking reports is located at <a href="http://www.gartnerweb.com/public/static/datapro/toc/tocgns.html"><u>http://www.gartnerweb.com/public/static/datapro/toc/tocgns.html</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
    You may be able to borrow market research reports from IBM’s Marketing Analysis Information Center (MAIC) in White
    Plains, NY. If the MAIC has a second copy of a report, you can sometimes arrange to borrow it for a brief period of
    time. You can also visit the MAIC to use their collection.
</p>
<p>
    The MAIC collection is indexed in the IBM Technical Information Retrieval Center’s (ITIRC) MDOC database. Selected
    market research reports are included, in full text, in ITIRC’s COMP database. To access the ITIRC databases use <a href="http://w3.itirc.ibm.com/"><u>http://w3.itirc.ibm.com</u></a>. COMP access is IBM Confidential. Access via ITIRC
    requires management approval. COMP is also available to registered users of ViewBlue.
</p>
<p>
    You can search ITIRC’s other business and engineering databases for magazine articles. Some of the articles are
    reproduced in entirety. ITIRC also offers a fulfillment service for magazine articles. IBM libraries and university
    libraries are other good sources of magazine articles.It is a good idea to consider if IBM is a member or has a
    business relationship with an organization that may have information you need. For instance, IBM has a sector
    representative to the ITU. Sometimes, IBM’s organizational representatives can be very helpful in pinpointing specific
    information or referring you to sources. Also, if IBM has a business relationship with a marketing research firm, you
    may be able to talk to an analyst or receive additional information or reports.
</p>
<p>
    For critical information, you may want to ask a networking trained individual from IBM in the target country to review
    and comment on your findings.
</p>
<p>
    If you are using data collected more than three months in the past, check details on any critical wide area network
    services for currency.
