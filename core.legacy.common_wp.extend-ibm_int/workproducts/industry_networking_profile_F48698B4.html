    The Industry Networking Profile provides an industry context for network recommendations and comparison points for the
    client’s network. Understanding industry specific networking activities allows for networking recommendations which
    capitalize on industry-wide efforts or help to comply with standards or regulations. For instance, a client may benefit
    from joining a common industry network for trading purposes (example: the Insurance Value Added Network in the United
    States or Canada) or high availability may be designed into a bank’s network to assist in meeting governmental
    reporting requirements.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Understanding the networking activities of key competitors may provide insights on how these competitors are
    contributing to business success in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reducing costs
    </li>
    <li>
        Reducing the business activity cycle time
    </li>
    <li>
        Improving quality of products and services

    <li>
        Improving customer satisfaction

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The industry segment section may include information about standards that impact the client’s business.&nbsp; In turn,
    these standards may impact network decisions.&nbsp; For instance, if banking regulations require high availability for
    automated teller machines (ATMs) or significant fines will be levied, the wide area network recommendations must
    include techniques or design features for providing the appropriate level of availability.&nbsp; IT standards
    compliance may also be part of an engagement but the Industry Networking Profile focuses on industry standards in the
    client’s area of business rather than internal or external IT standards for equipment or software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Avoid indicating to a client that you intend to provide information about specific competitors that you receive from
    inside IBM due IBM’s business relationships with those competitors.&nbsp; If you do agree to use IBM resources, you may
    need to generalize your research results.&nbsp; In effect, this turns key competitor research into industry segment
    research.
</p>
<p>
    Some typical research techniques are document review, online searching and e-mail or telephone inquiries.&nbsp;
    Research resources include industry experts, trade and professional associations, industry publications and market
    research firms.
</p>
<p>
    Part of the IBM sales and services organization is organized into industry solution units (ISUs).&nbsp; Each ISU is
    charged with providing IBM hardware, software and services tailored to a specific industry.&nbsp; Examples of ISUs are
    Communications (formerly Telecommunications and Media), Distribution, Industrial, Finance and Insurance.&nbsp;
    Individuals assigned to the ISUs are knowledgeable about the industries they represent.&nbsp; To find a contact in an
    ISU, look at the Global Industries Intranet homepage.&nbsp; The URL for the homepage is <a href="http://w3-1.ibm.com/industries">http://w3-1.ibm.com/industries</a>.
</p>
<p>
    For industry segment information, validate references to common industry networks, trade or professional associations,
    standards and regulations by cross checking the references with the sponsoring bodies.&nbsp; For industry segments,
    sponsoring bodies are often trade or professional associations, standards organizations or governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Most industries have trade or professional associations that cut across company lines.&nbsp; A trade or professional
    association is in the business of providing support and information concerning the industry it represents.&nbsp; A
    source of trade and professional associations arranged by industry is the Encyclopedia of Associations.&nbsp; This
    reference book is available in many libraries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Trade and professional associations may have special interest groups focused on information technology.&nbsp; Some
    associations are devoted to information technology or networking in a specific industry.&nbsp; They can be rich
    resources for industry information with a technological orientation.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;Many trade and professional associations use the Internet to disseminate information about their industries.
</p>
<p>
    Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Healthcare Information and Management Information Society - <a href="http://www.himss.org/">http://www.himss.org/</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        EDUCAUSE - <a href="http://www.educause.edu/">http://www.educause.edu/</a> – This homepage provides a link to a
        section on current issues in higher education and information technology&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The <em>Encyclopedia of Associations</em> lists homepage addresses for associations.
</p>
<p>
    If IBM is a corporate member of an association or if you can find an IBM employee who is a member (sometimes the
    association will help you with this), you can often arrange to use member benefits.&nbsp; This can sometimes mean
    access to information that is not available to non-members.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, trade magazines may have IT special issues or be focused on IT for specific industry segments.&nbsp; For
    instance, Chain Store Age (<a href="http://www.chainstoreage.com/">http://www.chainstoreage.com/</a>) publishes an
    annual survey of IT in the retailing industry while Insurance Networking focuses on networking in the insurance
    industry.
</p>
<p>
    Market research firms also examine different industry segments and how they use IT to support business
    objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Datapro, Yankee Group, IDC and Gartner Group are several examples.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    You may be able to borrow market research reports from IBM’s Marketing Analysis Information Center (MAIC) in White
    Plains, NY.&nbsp; If the MAIC has a second copy of a report, you can sometimes arrange to borrow it for a brief period
    of time.&nbsp; You can also visit the MAIC to use their collection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The MAIC collection is indexed in the IBM Technical Information Retrieval Center’s (ITIRC) MDOC database. Selected
    market research reports are included, in full text, in ITIRC’s COMP database.&nbsp; To access the ITIRC databases use
    <a href="http://w3.itirc.ibm.com/">http://w3.itirc.ibm.com/</a>.&nbsp; COMP access is IBM Confidential.&nbsp; Access
    via ITIRC requires management approval.&nbsp; COMP is also available to registered users of ViewBlue.
</p>
<p>
    If IBM has a business relationship with a marketing research firm, you may be able to talk to an analyst or receive
    additional information or reports.
</p>
<p>
    You can search ITIRC’s other business and engineering databases for magazine articles.&nbsp; Some of the articles are
    reproduced in entirety.&nbsp; ITIRC also offers a fulfillment service for magazine articles.&nbsp; IBM libraries and
    university libraries are other good sources of magazine articles.
</p>
<p>
    For the key competitor information, you may be able to cross check public information with information gathered from
    IBM’s client team.&nbsp; However, in some cases, the IBM client team will not be willing to share details with
    you.&nbsp; Also, in most cases, it should be made clear to the client that this is a research exercise where only
    publicly available sources are used. You might use privately available sources for verification of what is available
    publicly.

    Making network recommendations without an understanding of industry specific networking activities may cause the client
    to build a piece of network infrastructure which could have more cost effectively been bought by joining a common
    industry network. Also, if industry specific standards and regulations are not investigated, the recommended network
    might not support compliance or even might work at cross-purposes to compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Making network recommendations without understanding competitors’ networks leaves out any insights that may be gathered
    during the research process.

    The industry specific section of this work product may not be necessary for a LAN engagement focused strictly on branch
    office activities with no requirements for data transfer or communication with a central site or outside organization.
</p>
<p>
    The client specific section of this work product is not required. In fact, unless the client contracts specifically for
    this activity, it should not be performed. When it is performed, the client should understand that this is a research
    exercise. A finite time period for the research should be set and, in most cases, it should be clear that publicly
    available sources will be used in performing the research. If privately available sources are reliable and available
    they can be used but are typically used to over deliver on this part of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Also, bear in mind that a client may choose to compare itself against other organizations using business criteria which
    does not involve their competition. For example, if the client has grown through acquisition, the client may wish to
    examine networking activities in companies that have also grown through multiple acquisitions.
