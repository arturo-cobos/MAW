    The Capability Model Definition work product depicts an integrated framework of a firm’s capabilities. This integrated
    framework&nbsp;shows how, and to what extent, these capabilities interact with and affect one another, in serving the
    value exchanges (where a product or service is exchanged for something of value) between the firm and its customers and
    other external value net players (Partners, Suppliers, Channels, etc.). The framework also shows the degree to which
    capabilities positively reinforce one another, or negatively impede one another, and the direction of cause and effect
    between related capabilities. In its most detailed form, this integrated framework shows how enablers combine to serve
    one or more capabilities. The Capability Model Definition represents those critical things that a firm must be capable
    of doing well to insure the performance of its business design.
</p>
<p>
    At its most detailed, the Capability Model Definition work product will describe a framework comprising four layers:

</p>
<p>
    The Capability Model Definition work product distinguishes between three types of capability, namely external
    capabilities, supporting capabilities, and common capabilities.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>External capabilities</strong> directly support value exchanges with external value net players. These
        capabilities tend to be Value Net Player specific, such as capabilities for suppliers, or even segment specific,
        capabilities specific to large wholesale customers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img height="445" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc2.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Supporting capabilities</strong> – the internal capabilities which support the external capabilities. These
        are normally value net player and segment specific.&nbsp; Their relationship to value exchanges are indirect.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img style="WIDTH: 600px; HEIGHT: 451px" height="445" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc3.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Core capabilities</strong> are those upon which the whole business depends.&nbsp;&nbsp;They include
        internal capabilities that directly or indirectly support external capabilities and which are reusable across two
        or more value net player groups. This third class of capabilities would include the enterprise architecture
        capabilities, such as enterprise wide data integrity management.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul><img height="470" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc4.JPG" width="600" /> 
<p>
    The Capability Model Definition work product can be used to depict the ‘As Is’ state, but is more typically developed
    for the ‘To Be’ state.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    A completed Capability Model Definition work product can be used to depict the capabilities for a complete enterprise,
    or an individual Line of Business (LOB).
</p></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Notation</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    At the highest level, the Capability Model Definition work product would include a Strategic Capability Network (SCN)
    diagram to show how capabilities support the value propositions of the firm’s offerings.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="348" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddef_not1.JPG" width="520" />
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    In understanding the value that capabilities deliver to the business, it is important to depict both positive
    capability impact as well as negative impact of capabilities.<br />
    <br />
</p>
<p>
    <img height="389" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddef_not2.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    In many cases, the breadth of focal area of an engagement, causes the SCN diagram to become too confusing to support
    the level of analysis required for correlating and optimizing capabilities, and should be augmented with a capability
    matrix.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="443" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddef_not3.JPG" width="777" /><br />
    <br />
    The spreadsheet format of a capability matrix provides a convenient and extendable tool for capturing, analyzing and
    depicting capability model design attributes. A numbering scheme will need to be established in order to maintain
    traceability of capabilities and enablers in the various analyses required to complete the Capability Model Definition.
    One such scheme is depicted in the examples included below.
</p>
<p>
    One dimension of Capability Model Definition uses a spreadsheet to show the external capabilities and their supporting
    internal capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="472" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddef_not4.JPG" width="736" /><br />
    <br clear="all" />
    Another dimension of the Capability Model Definition shows the Enablers and how they relate to prioritized external and
    internal capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="443" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddef_not5.JPG" width="748" />
</p>
<p>
    When the relationship of capabilities is not hierarchical (one-to-many), but is many-to-many, then it is useful to show
    those relationships using an association matrix. In the matrix below, the information in the cells can show both
    positive (supporting) and negative (inhibiting) relationships.<br />

    <strong>Scope of Analysis</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Capability Model Definition provides a valuable tool for decision making from its highest level, depicting how
    capabilities support value propositions and offerings, to its lowest level of a fully prioritized, linked and
    correlated set of capabilities and enablers required to support a business design.&nbsp; The challenge for the
    project/engagement manager, is to decide where to set the scope and boundaries for analysis at each phase of the
    engagement.&nbsp; The following provides a rough guide for determining how detailed a work product will be produced:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Strategy:</strong> The work product includes the capabilities identified and correlated for strategic
    opportunities, in support of a given business design for profitability and sustained advantage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Design:</strong> The work product includes prioritized capabilities and enablers for the purpose of design
    optimization, investment and resource allocation and release planning to deliver the initiatives in the strategic
    roadmap.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Business Design Context Sensitivity</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Capability Model Definition is relevant in the context of a set of value exchanges positioned in an external
    environment. As market segment sizes change, buyer preferences shift, the value a firm can derive from a particular
    offering can change dramatically. Capabilities which have led to sustainable advantage in the past, may not do so in
    the future because of their relevance to external forces.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Capability Model Definition work product
    forms a basis for the continuous assessment of these external dynamics on internal workings, and provides the means to
    avoid a failure of the firm’s business design.
