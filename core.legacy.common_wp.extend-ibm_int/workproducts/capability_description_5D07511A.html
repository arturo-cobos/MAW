    <i>A <strong>Capability</strong></i> identifies any combination of knowledge, organization, process, and technology
    (Capability Enablers/Resources or KOPT) [We will use the shorthand KOPT to refer to these in the remainder of this
    document]. Also note, Capability Enabler and Resource both refer to KOPT.) that enables a firm (or business unit) to
    deliver a specific value proposition <i>directly</i> to a defined segment [A Segment is defined as a collection of
    firms or individuals that have similar wants and needs from the perspective of the focal (client’s) firm.] of
    stakeholders, e.g., customer segment or supplier segment, or <i>indirectly</i> through the support of other
    capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="190" alt="Capability" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/cap1.GIF" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    The internal components of a given capability can vary from firm to firm. For example, several firms may be observed to
    be capable of delivering the same value propositions; therefore, each of these firms may be described as having the
    same capability. When analyzed in more detail and compared across firms, each of these firms may have developed or
    configured a very different set of KOPT in its own unique capability. This identifies an important use and
    characteristic of capabilities: they provide a scheme whereby the similarities across firms or business models can be
    identified while the details of the differences among firms can be preserved.
</p>
<p>
    More specifically, a capability’s title provides a label for a firm’s collection of specific KOPT commissioned to
    support the delivery of specific value propositions. These labels or titles should be assigned so as to allow for
    identification of similarities. The capability description adds the details of a particular firm’s KOPT, identifying
    more detailed similarities and differences among specific capabilities that each support the delivery of the same value
    propositions.
</p>
<p>
    Since in subsequent analyses we may need to know those capabilites which <i>directly</i> support value propositions, we
    refer to these as <u><i>Externally Focused Capabilities</i></u>. These Capabilites are externally focused and directly
    support a value proposition to one or more segments. Capabilites that <i>indirectly</i> support value propositions
    through other capabilites are referred to as <u><i>Internally Focused Capabilities</i></u>. These capabilites are
    internally focused and support other capabilities. Occassionally, capabilities will be observed to support value
    propositions directly and support value propositions through other capabilities. These capabilities are labeled as both
    External Focused and Internally Focused.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="114" alt="Capability" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/cap2.GIF" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    Capabilities are usually described in the format:
</p>
<p>
    <b>For example: "Ability to access information"</b>
</p>
<p>
    Examples of capabilities that enable all major Value Net Players [A Value Net Player is defined as one of the following
    - Customer, Supplier, Competitor/Substitute or Complementor]. For more information on Value Nets, refer to the Value
    Exchange Technique Paper:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ability to access customer information
    </li>
    <li>
        Ability to generate customer awareness
    </li>
    <li>
        Ability to source high quality components
    </li>
    <li>
        Ability to create and maintain partnerships and alliances
    </li>
    <li>
        Ability to quickly identify and analyze competitor actions in the marketplace
    </li>
    <li>
        Ability to dynamically source capacity from competitors
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Numerous combinations of KOPT can deliver capabilities as indicated by the diversity in management systems, skills,
    intellectual capital, organizational design and process implementations across firms. In general, there is no "one-way"
    of delivering a capability. Indeed, there may be no "best-way" of delivering a capability for all firms. What is best
    for any given firm may depend to a large degree on the other capabilities (and supporting KOPT) that are available in
    that firm. This flexibility is part of the strength of using capabilities versus other more detailed and specific
    representations. The primary advantages of Capabilities are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Avoidance of the tactical detail that may cloud a strategic decision, since capabilities are an abstraction of
        KOPT,
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoidance of the myopic (restricted) focus on delivering value in one and only one manner. It allows the client to
        explore multiple options for delivering the value.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    In the most simplistic usage, capabilities identify the essential components of a proposed new business initiative. In
    this instance, the minimal description of a capability is needed, including only the value produced and not requiring
    the details of its Capability Enablers (KOPT). If additional information on the Capability Enablers (KOPT) is
    available, it should be captured during the current task or later in follow-on tasks. In general, many analyses
    involving capabilities will employ the details describing the Capability Enablers.
</p>
<p>
    The most detailed capability descriptions contains information about Capability Enablers including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Processes that are in place or would need to be in place to deliver the value produced by the capability
    </li>
    <li>
        What knowledge and skills the organization must have, including any critical information or data
    </li>
    <li>
        The organization required in terms of roles and responsibilities and critical management practices and policies
    </li>
    <li>
        Technology deployed or necessary to enable this capability including classes of applications that would be required
        and any necessary technical infrastructure
    </li>
</ul></td>

    Since capabilities can be described at varying levels of detail, it is important to understand what subsequent analyses
    will be performed with the capabilities and their descriptions.&nbsp; This should dictate the level and detail of the
    description.&nbsp; For example, capabilities identified during an e-Design engagement will normally comprise a far more
    detailed description of a firm or business initiative than those defined for a strategy engagement.&nbsp; The
    difference in detail arises because when we are working to define an e-business strategy, we are interested in the
    commonality and differentiation among a set of e-business initiatives.&nbsp; In this situation, we need only identify
    the most obvious and most significant capabilities that comprise the initiatives.&nbsp; However, when we are optimizing
    the design of one of those initiatives, it is necessary to work from a much more detailed decomposition of an
    initiative into its constituent capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    When defining capabilities for a firm, confusion can arise over the level of detail at which the capabilities should be
    defined.&nbsp; The capability, “Ability to generate awareness” describes a very general characteristic of most
    firms.&nbsp; In contrast, “Ability to access market demographics” is a more detailed capability that often appears in
    support of the former capability.&nbsp; It need not be identified unless it also supports other capabilities.&nbsp; The
    level detail of the capability should be dictated by the needs of the engagement and the agreed to scope.&nbsp;
    Obviously, the more general capabilities can be identified far easier than the more detailed capabilities.&nbsp; A
    careful review of identified capabilities, whether new or existing, should be performed to ensure that a “common level”
    has been achieved.
</p>
<p>
    Describing capabilities should be an iterative process.&nbsp; As stated above, a capability may be described at a
    high-level during the initial activities within a strategy (sufficient amount of detail to make the relevant decisions)
    and then further refined and described in later activities and fully detailed during e-Design (to support the design
    and eventual implementation of a supported initiative).<br />
