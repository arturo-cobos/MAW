    <b>Views</b>
</p>There are many influences that determine the infrastructure management style most appropriate for the client's specific
environment. A view can act as a pattern or template to structure the groups of objects to be managed. Views define sets of
element groups. These groups give us a method for pulling the actual elements in the infrastructure together based on the
customer's systems management style, and reflect how the client’s want to manage their environments.</td>

    The infrastructure management style most appropriate for the client's specific environment can vary significantly based
    on the customer’s systems management style.&nbsp; The views described here are not to be considered a definitive list.
    There are certainly other perspectives and categories that could be used. Note that the SMFD-TE templates are
    structured based upon the Component View.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Component View</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This view represents the traditional IT way of describing an operational infrastructure; it is a view from the inside
    looking outward toward the end user. The elements in the target environment are grouped together according to the data
    processing functions they perform within the infrastructure. Such basic categories as system or computer nodes,
    networks and applications serve as a starting point. They are broken down further based on organizational
    responsibility and ownership; a particular group within the IT organization may be responsible for managing the remote
    LAN networks, while another organization is responsible for central site hardware. Another factor in defining
    categories in the component view is the technical skills required to operate and manage a particular group of elements;
    in a heterogeneous environment, one group of people may be responsible for mainframe operating systems, while an
    entirely different one is responsible for distributed UNIX operating systems.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>End User View</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Much has been written about a re-orientation of the IT world resulting from the "PC Revolution". For many large
    customers, the primary thrust of this change has been to drive the focus of data processing priorities away from the
    central site and toward the empowered end user. This view starts at the user's desktop and works inwards. The user
    becomes a virtual application. The user assembles and links various pieces (objects) of application logic together
    based on the particular business function she is performing. When another business function is started, a different set
    of objects will be assembled dynamically and kept active only for the length of time required to perform the function.
    This "outside-in" view demands services from different systems that may have very little in common with the nominal
    target one.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Application View</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As the name implies, this view utilizes an application centric perspective. Where the component view is "inside-out"
    and the end-user view is "outside-in", the application view starts with the application as the stable center and brings
    the user and the technical infrastructure together around it. This view is often encountered where the customer's
    application development department has a strong influence and where extensive use of application development tools is
    present.
</p>
<p>
    This view takes the application as a representative of a group of homogeneous, stable users. The set of IT
    infrastructure resources which support the application are identified and grouped accordingly. Since different types of
    applications require different sets of resources, application classes play an important role in defining the element
    group taxonomy of this view.<br />
    The distributed client/server application is an example of how a particular application type defines a set of element
    groups. There are standard ways of designing client/server applications so that their functions can be distributed. The
    most common is to divide the application into the following components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Presentation Logic
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Business Specific Logic
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Logic to access System Resource Managers
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each of these logical components requires a set of IT resources to execute; the required resources are defined as
    element groups for this class of applications.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The practitioner can document the managed IT elements in several ways. The best way is to start with a pictorial
    overview.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The high-level overview should be followed by a list of the managed elements in a hierarchical format showing the
    relationships of the elements.
