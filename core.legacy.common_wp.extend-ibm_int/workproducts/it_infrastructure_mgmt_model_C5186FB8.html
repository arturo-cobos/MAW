    The objective of this work product is to select an appropriate model (or models) for structuring the implementation of
    the client's IT management organization and tool architecture. The model should be relevant to the client's IT and
    business environments and meet the client's requirement for management control.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Selecting a model provides a vision that will foster consistency between future organizational design, assignment of
    management responsibilities and management tool selection and design. Tool and organization characteristics will vary
    significantly among the different management models.
</p>
<p>
    This work product is used by the consultant to describe the management model alternatives and to generate client
    discussion as to the model that best fits their environment.

    This model describes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The distribution, location and scope (domains) of management control and responsibility.
    </li>
    <li>
        The distribution and location of management function.
    </li>
    <li>
        The flow of information and style of communication.
    </li>
    <li>
        The mechanisms for governing this model and ensuring compliance, review and vitality.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A management model may be applied both to the IT management organization/governance model and to the IT management
    technology model. The management model is not the same as the organization structure however. Nor is it the same as the
    systems management tool architecture. The organization structure and tool architecture are directed by the management
    model and represent the way the IT management model is physically implemented.
</p>
<p>
    Model selection is a key architectural decision that defines the direction and shape of the subsequent framework
    design. Choice of one or more models is dependent upon the client's style and philosophy, organizational aspects, and
    the existing IT management framework.

    The IT Infrastructure Management Model work product will often contain a graphical representation that is usually based
    on one of the following model types, but may also be a hybrid of these.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Enterprise Central&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Workgroup&nbsp;

        Distributed&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Enterprise Hierarchical
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There may well be multiple versions or representations of the IT Infrastructure Management Model. The model may have
    different physical and logical views that require separate representations. Additionally there may be separate models
    for the distribution of process or organizational roles and responsibilities and for the distribution of management
    tool control and execution functions.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The IT Infrastructure Management Model may also include a matrix to show the broad distribution of management
    responsibilities. This will typically show primary and secondary responsibilities for ownership and execution of key
    management processes.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The controls necessary to ensure that the model is appropriately implemented and applied consistently will generally be
    documented as formally defined management processes.<br />

    A management model may be applied both to the management organization/governance model and to the management technology
    model. The management model is not the same as the organization structure however. Nor is it the same as the systems
    management tool architecture. The organization structure and tool architecture are directed by the management model and
    represent the way the management model has been physically implemented.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The organization/governance and technology views of the management model do, however, influence one other. Therefore,
    before reviewing the current management model or selecting a new one, take the time to understand which view of the
    model you are dealing with and why.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Ordinarily the first choice should be to determine the future organizational/governance model and this choice will
    usually be made during the “strategy” stage of the solution life cycle. The way the client prefers to distribute
    management responsibilities, process execution and control should then place requirements on the design and shape of
    the resulting technical infrastructure, rather than vice versa.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The management model is an important element of the client's desired future state. As with the guiding principles, it
    describes the future management style and will directly influence the subsequent organization design and the design of
    the supporting management tools infrastructure. If the "to be" model is significantly different to the current model it
    is likely to drive one or more corresponding transition initiatives necessary to transform the required aspects of the
    management framework. These initiatives could be quite large or lengthy and far-reaching in their impact. Therefore it
    is important to consider the future management model as part of the strategy stage of the life cycle, where the broad
    implications of a change in management model can be appropriately handled.<br />

<p>
    <strong>Key Criteria for Selecting a Management Model</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    <i><strong>Control</strong></i> -Where are decisions made?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Single or Multiple
    </li>
    <li>
        Single - A single point of control will be established for the target environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Multiple - Multiple points of control will be established for the target environment
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><i>Execution</i></b> - Where are management functions executed?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Single or Multiple
    </li>
    <li>
        Single - A single point of execution will be established for the target environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Multiple - Multiple points of execution will be established for the target environment
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><i>Communication</i></b> - How will communication of information flow in the target environment?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Vertical and/or Peer-Peer
    </li>
    <li>
        Vertical - Communication flows vertically from managers/management servers to clients
    </li>
    <li>
        Peer-Peer - Communication flows peer-peer between managers/management servers
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The selection is validated through this discussion.&nbsp; Selecting a model provides a vision that will foster
    consistency between future organizational development and tool selection.&nbsp; Technology and organization
    characteristics will vary significantly among the different management models.
