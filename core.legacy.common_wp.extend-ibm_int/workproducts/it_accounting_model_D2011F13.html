    The IT Accounting work product provides a framework, mechanism for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Appreciating individual and overall costs of providing IT services.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enables (or otherwise) customer relationship development through cost transparency.
    </li>
    <li>
        Charging for IT services provided to the recipients of such services.
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing a baseline by which make or buy decisions can be made with respect to IT service provision.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The ultimate aims for an IT accounting system; that needs to be reflected in the development of an IT accounting work
    product are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Part of the overall definition and development of services.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transparency of used services / products or transactions.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Main Description</th><td class="sectionTableCell">The IT Accounting Model generally takes the form of a spreadsheet in its development and is a further development /
extension of the cost model work product. Without the latter construction an IT accounting model cannot be developed. The
IT accounting model generally contains: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Individual in-scope elements of cost with costs applied (from the cost model).
    </li>
    <li>
        A set of defined services with overall service costs applied / absorbed (See below for definition).
    </li>
    <li>
        A set of absorption / allocation / apportionment bases to enable the appropriate application of element costs to
        defined services.
    </li>
    <li>
        A set of absorption / allocation / apportionment bases for appropriate distribution of service costs to clients
        (i.e. the proportion of a service that a particular set of users should reasonably and equitability pay).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As such allocation is done twice, the first time in terms of costs to services, the second iteration is of these
    services to clients. As such IT accounting is often referred to as a double absorption or allocation method.
</p>
<p>
    When the IT Accounting work product is combined with an appropriate management process the IT accounting model provides
    the foundation for a cost measurement, management control and reporting system.
</p>
<p>
    The definition of ‘service’ within such a construct is variable. It depends upon client accounting requirements and
    level of service provision maturity. As such service can refer to the provision of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Technology components or individual components / products such as storage or processing power etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizational functions or cost centers such as application maintenance and support, technical support and help
        desk.
    </li>
    <li>
        Processes such as end user support, problem management, backup and recovery management, project management,
        application development etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        True end-to-end service composed of appropriate processes, organizational components and technology. Examples here
        may be Solution build which would incorporate all aspects of business, application and infrastructure to provide a
        particular service, User support which could be a centralized incident management service, a combination of local
        and centralized customer contact support or a variations of this depending upon the service provided. Please refer
        to the ‘IT Service Reference Model’ reference file attached to the derive IT accounting model task for further
        detail and a framework for service derivation and definition.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that as the ‘sophistication’ of service definition increases so does the cost of both development and maintenance
    of such a system, as such this needs to be a consideration in the development of an IT accounting model.
</p>
<p>
    This work product mainly focuses on ‘internal’ IT accounting where services are costed and charged on a ‘non profit’
    basis, as such it deals with functions within organizations that are deemed ‘cost or service centers’. Such a model
    could be adapted to consider where the Accounting system is being developed for a ‘profit center’. Here the provider of
    services recoveries both costs and revenue. This would however require a greater degree of sophistication,
    incorporating pricing techniques such as Cost Plus Pricing, Cost-volume-profit analysis, Target costing, Skimming and
    penetration policies, and Customer profitability analysis.<br />

    The graphic illustrated below highlights the major activities that need to be performed in order to derive an IT
    accounting model.
</p>

    &nbsp;<br />
    <strong><u><em>Strategy</em></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to embarking on an accounting engagement, the clients cost objectives need to be clearly articulated and
    understood. For instance the development of a sophisticated accounting model that requires an expensive management
    system to run and maintain would be totally inappropriate if cost reduction was an objective of an IT accounting
    engagement. As part of this exercise IT needs to be appropriately positioned on a strategic framework, such as the
    strategic intent model (refer to the IT Strategic Value Framework work product). This will strongly indicate whether IT
    is cost focused, service focused, or a partner and enabler; also whether IT is a cost, profit or mixed center, which
    has strong implications to both the required cost, sophistication and style of IT accounting Model to be
    developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u><em>Scope and Framework</em></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    If services are not well understood or defined then this needs to be remedied. Such an undertaking represents a
    significant effort and engagement all of its own. Refer to the ‘IT Service Reference Model’ reference file attached to
    the derive IT accounting model task for further detail and a framework for service derivation and definition.
    Essentially a cost model work product needs to be developed as a pre-cursor to the development of an IT accounting
    model.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u><em>Model - Service or Offering Costs</em></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Essentially this is the first level of allocation, where element costs are allocated in part or whole to defined
    services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u><em>Model - Customer Pricing and Billing</em></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The second level of allocation occurs here. Overall service costs are distributed equitably between users of the
    service. Note that it is absolutely critical to get appropriate buy in to these allocations. This may need to be in the
    form of effective executive sponsorship and ensuring that a strong audit trail and rationale is evident for allocation
    decisions, appropriate service pricing is then derived and a mechanism for billing.
</p>
<p>
    Note also:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Skeleton accounting models as with cost models are normally built prior to data collection. The actual numbers
        collected are then added into the model, as they are collected. The skeleton model also normally contains an
        initial set of formula that is then refined as the data is populated.
    </li>
    <li>
        The development of an IT accounting model is only a start, in order to operationalize this process, tool and
        organizational development needs to be pursued. The accounting model only provides a framework by which this can be
        achieved.
    </li>
    <li>
        As with cost models, IT accounting models are often used in organizationally sensitive situations (someone is
        trying to sell something and / or individuals or groups of people will be disadvantaged). Obtaining “true” figures
        to populate the model is often difficult and time consuming, the higher the level of experience and comparison /
        validation sources the greater chance of using figures that can be “defended” and accepted.
