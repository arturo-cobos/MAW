<ol>
    <li>
        an "as-is" model of the firm’s current capabilities and
    </li>
    <li>
        an assessment of the current capabilities’ strengths and weaknesses by evaluating the relationships (linkages)
        between capabilities, value propositions and other capabilities.
    </li>
</ol>The approach is based upon the Strategic Capability Network (SCN) framework developed by IBM’s T.J. Watson Research
Center. It assesses a client’s capabilities by creating an integrated view of the internal structure of the firm in its
external context. 
<p>
    The underlying framework that guides the identification of capabilities in the model is the Value Net (Figure 1),
    initially defined in the book Co-opetition [see (1)] and greatly enhanced by IBM. The value net divides a firm’s
    external interactions into four quadrants or Players – Customers, Suppliers, Competitors and Complementors. The Player
    categories in the value net represent the starting point for the identification of the firm’s capabilities.

<p>
    For engagements focused on internal Players such as employees or other divisions (intra-company), simply use the
    targeted groups/divisions as the starting point for the identification of capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    Within each Player category there are segments that the firm exchanges value with – customer, supplier, partner and
    even competitor (co-opetition) segments. Segments are defined as collections of firms (B2B) or groups of individuals
    (B2C) that have similar wants and needs from the perspective of the firm. A Value Exchange has two parts. The firm
    offers a <i>Value Proposition</i> to a segment and receives <i>Value Capture</i> in return.
</p>
<p>
    Figure 2 represents another type of value net illustration that will be used from here forward to assist in the
    identification and categorization of current capabilities. <i>This illustration is not intended to be the client
    deliverable for this assessment, but a tool to:</i>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        help consultants parse out areas of a firm that contain relevant capabilities and,
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>

<p>
    To help identify capabilities, the firm (as defined in Figure 2 as within the “Firm Boundary”) is divided into five
    areas, four of which are externally focused and one that is internally focused:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Externally Focused</b> – capabilities in these areas primarily support external value exchanges 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Customer Focused – this area contains capabilities that primarily support value exchanges between the firm
                and its customer segments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Complementor Focused – this area contains capabilities that primarily support value exchanges between the
                firm and its complementors, e.g., partners.
            </li>
            <li>
                Supplier Focused – this area contains capabilities that primarily support value exchanges between the firm
                and its supplier segments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Competitor Focused - this area contains capabilities that primarily support value exchanges between the
                firm and its competitor segments. In situations where co-opetition exists, then capabilities will exist to
                support value exchanges. However, in many cases the capabilities in this area may be focused on monitoring
                and assessing competitor’s actions in the marketplace, e.g., competitive intelligence.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Internally Focused</b> - this area contains capabilities that support other capabilities, either in other areas,
        e.g., customer or supplier focused capabilities, or other internally focused capabilities. For example, the
        capability, “Ability to dynamically allocate production resources” may support the customer-focused capability,
        “Ability to quickly configure products to orders.”
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In some cases, capabilities will both directly support value exchanges externally and support other internal
    capabilities. For example, an airline’s capability, “Ability to provide best-in-class baggage handling” may directly
    support the value proposition (value exchange), “No lost baggage” and the internal capability, “Ability to provide
    excellent customer service.”
</p>
<p>
    Once the current capabilities have been identified, the model (capabilities) is assessed against best practices or
    internal expectations. Capability gaps are identified and, along with existing capabilities, assessed in terms of
    performance (Gaps are obviously the lowest in performance) and importance.
</p>
<p>
    The capabilities are assessed at a “white-box” level by evaluating the performance and importance of the <u>support
    they provide</u>. The assessment is primarily performed at this level due to the large number of capabilities in the
    “as-is” model and the time involved with assessing each capability at a black-box (capability enabler) level, e.g.,
    knowledge, process, technology and organizational components.
</p>
<p>
    This work product creates a model of the current capabilities in either a tabular or graphical format.

    This work product can be extremely large and complex depending upon the scope of the engagement.&nbsp; Thus, the
    attention and time spent on Step 1, Refine and clarify the Focus Definition (scope of activities that will be
    assessed), is crucial to the successful completion of this work product in the time allotted.&nbsp; Negligence in Step
    1 could result in missed deadlines and, worse yet, a focus on areas that are not of primary concern to the engagement
    or the client.
</p>
<p>
    There are many tools and techniques that already exist that can be employed to help in the assessment.&nbsp; The
    Dynamic Stability Model is a cognitive model that categorizes the business capabilities based on the nature of the
    Process and Product Change, i.e., Mass Production, Mass Customization, Invention or Continuous Improvement. An
    understanding of these generic organization, process, technology and knowledge characteristics associated with each
    capability position can be useful in assessing alignment of Capabilities with strategy.&nbsp; Any Business
    Transformation/Business Process Reengineering tools and techniques can be used to assist in the identification and
    assessment of capabilities.&nbsp; However, these tools are usually more detailed and lower level in their coverage, so
    avoid be “bogged down” with low-level analysis.
</p>
<p>
    Capability Model Assessment requires good industry knowledge coupled with creativity in synthesizing a client’s
    business objectives and business issues.<br />
