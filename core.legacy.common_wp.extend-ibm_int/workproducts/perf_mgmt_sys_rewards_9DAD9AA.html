    To establish effective systems that will set, track, evaluate, reward, reinforce, and provide feedback on the skills,

    <strong>Performance Management System</strong>: an iterative process where performance is set, monitored, assessed, and
    linked to consequences or outcomes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Total Rewards System</strong>: all mechanisms by which people in an organization feel rewarded or through which
    an organization communicates what it values.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Balanced Scorecard:</b> The balanced scorecard approach takes the words that express strategy and goals and
    translates them into statements of "what we must do" and then into clear numeric key performance indicators (KPIs).
    KPIs are readily understood and are the basis for consistent communication, performance management, and initiatives
    across a large organization. The Balanced Scorecard complements financial measures with operational measures on
    customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization's innovation and improvement activities -- operational
    measures that drive future financial performance. It enables executives to prioritize investments and make operational
    decisions using proactive metrics.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Performance appraisals and bonuses are sensitive issues. Therefore, anticipate resistance and be vigilant about reward
    systems that may run counter to your aims.
</p>
<p>
    It may be necessary to dismantle measures that encourage local optimization at the expense of the rest of the
    organization.<br />
    Involve middle managers and supervisors early in the process and seek their buy-in. Begin by actively listening to
    their concerns and addressing the ones you can as quickly as possible before you ask for their support.
</p>
<p>
    In many redesigns it will become less possible and less necessary to hold individuals specifically accountable for
    overall outcomes. The greatest gains will often come from interdependence and teamwork.
</p>
<p>
    An effective Performance Management process is regularly scheduled and timely, and it is developmental. It reinforces
    superior performance and recognizes the achievement of goals. It corrects inferior performance and establishes
    performance improvements, and it ensures appropriate levels of training.
</p>
<p>
    With measures, some of the indicators will be very soft, while many will not be sourced from existing systems. Some
    data may come from external sources. Measures should be linked to SMART objectives, and goals should cascade down the
    organization. A good measure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Is accepted as being meaningful to the customer
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Is part of a set of balanced metrics
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Shows a trend, not a snapshot
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Is economical to collect and maintain
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Is simple, logical, and repeatable
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Drives appropriate behavior
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once they are designed, validate the systems in a series of presentations and workshops with the interested
    communities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            HR
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Management
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Staff representatives
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The executive management of the organization or division, who should be the final approving body
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            With the business in implementing the business measures through the Business Information model
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The final test of success will be if the systems accomplish the client organization's goals and are accepted by
    employees. The best way to ensure this is to involve employees as much as possible from the start and to ensure that
    the results and reactions to the implementation of new performance management, measures, and rewards systems are
    monitored and the results fed back to amending the system if necessary.

processes, and organization, the changes probably will not "stick," will be ineffective, or will not achieve anticipated

    This work product is essential if the client is making changes to the process or organization, and it can be produced
    at a level to suit the nature and focus of the changes, size of the organization, and groups affected. For example, for
    small changes to individual jobs the work product would include only the measures and rewards for the changing jobs,
    rather than a design for the whole performance management system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
    It should be omitted only if there is no organization change, or if the planning and execution of the change are

    management, measures, and reward systems.
