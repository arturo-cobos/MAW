    The purpose of the Strategic Market Position is to select a strategic position that provides competitive advantage for
    the company. This involves making trade-offs to choose:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The segments to focus upon
    </li>
    <li>
        The basis on which the firm will differentiate itself from its competitors
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It also provides the basis for configuring the capabilities and resources.
</p>
<p>
    Once a valued position is identified, the capabilities required to create, capture and sustain value would be
    identified and assessed against current capabilities and to those of competitors.

    The analysis of the company's competitive space in the industry is usually along three dimensions: products/services
    (offerings), customers and access. The customer view is driven from customer needs and wants analysis (from CVM). Other
    analytics such as Advantage Curves can, and should when possible, be used to analyze an offering from a customer need
    and cost/margin perspective in relation to competitor offerings.
</p>
<p>
    Positioning is selecting the segments to serve and determining a unique mix of value that the firm intends to deliver
    which will differentiate it from its competitors.
</p>
<p>
    Positioning involves making a selection at two levels:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Segments to participate in.
    </li>
    <li>
        Selecting the value proposition that will differentiate the firm from its competitors.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A clearly defined position creates competitive advantage by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Enabling the firm to focus its capabilities and resources to serve its segments better.
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing a clear "image," i.e. "what the company stands for," to the customers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing clear direction to the management and employees in decision making as well as day to day actions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other techniques such as the BCG Growth/Market Share Matrix can also be utilized.

    There are several types of notation:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Market Segmentation Cube</strong> - a three-dimensional framework that segments the competitive space on
        the dimensions of products/ service, customers and access.&nbsp; It is usually patterned or color-coded to identify
        where competitors also play.&nbsp; Matrices are equally useful in analyzing potential positions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Customer Wants & Needs</strong> (refer to this work product description for more details) - This work
        product can produce the following qualitative (non-statistically validated or prioritized) deliverables:

    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                A mapping of customer interactions ("moments of truth") to customer needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                A list of customer-defined ideal value outcomes at each interaction point ("moment of truth").
            </li>
            <li>
                A list of ideal value outcomes defined by the client based on their knowledge of the customers, suppliers,
                complementors, external influencers, etc. at each interaction point ("moment of truth").
            </li>
            <li>
                Hypotheses of customer/audience wants and needs by "Needs Hierarchy" to identify which are the basic needs
                ( if not met will drive defection) and which are high-value attractors (if met would differentiate and
                attract).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Advantage Curve</strong> - a two-dimensional curve that shows the cost/performance frontier for the
        industry formed by the best competitive offerings.&nbsp; A point on the frontier defines the best performance for a
        given cost.&nbsp; This analytic can help the firm in finalizing its position.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Strategic Positions should be driven by targeting customer needs and wants and then viewed against competition in terms
    of offerings and access.
</p>
<p>
    Ensure that the strategic position provides an adequate statement of where the enterprise stands relative to the
    marketplace, competition, and best practice that will be acceptable to senior management.&nbsp; Check that appropriate
    managers and specialists have been involved in its formulation.&nbsp; If there are gaps in the coverage, understand
    why, communicate to client and determine if gaps are important.&nbsp; Gaps may lead to additional scope of work.
</p>
<p>
    Senior management must agree with the positioning as a basis for more detailed analysis and definition when later
    developing capability models.
</p>
<p>
    Senior Management should review all pertinent positions and decide which ones they want to investigate further within
    the scope of the strategy engagement.&nbsp; Also they should review any issues raised and decide how they want to
    address them.&nbsp; The resolution of these issues may be critical to the strategy; others may have an impact on the
    outcome of the assignment.&nbsp; Other issues may have no impact on the strategy but management may wish to address
    them outside the scope of the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    Rely on senior industry, functional and technical specialists for competitive and market sector information.&nbsp;
    Because of the executive interaction, it requires this experience for credibility.&nbsp; Often they will not be basing
    their findings on detailed analysis, but on judgement and experience applied to sparse information obtained from
    research, a small number of executive interviews and/or workshops.&nbsp; The use of internal specialists at this stage
    will help build their support and commitment to the strategy.
</p>
<p>
    It is particularly important to gain confidence of management at this early stage in a strategy engagement, and to seek
    their views on how best to proceed, offering some alternatives.&nbsp; The final strategy will be theirs to implement,
    and, as such, their involvement and commitment to the process and the outcome is essential.&nbsp; Special care must be
    given with individuals who feel threatened in any way by the engagement, particularly business unit managers as they
    will be more heavily involved in capability definition and requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Only produce the briefest documents as summaries of the key findings.
