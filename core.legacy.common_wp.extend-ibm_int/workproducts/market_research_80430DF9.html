    The underlying purpose of all market research is to provide an objective base to assist in making strategic or tactical
    decisions. Objectivity comes from thorough and careful analysis of the research data but cannot be achieved without a
    proper research approach.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, market research is used in three ways - to describe, to explain and to validate. It would be a mistake to
    think of research as residing exclusively in one of these three categories. Research is a creative process and a
    research instrument may strive to combine the elements of various approaches in a manner that makes the best sense of
    the data.
</p>
<p>
    Market research can have a multitude of secondary uses in various IBM engagements. A few of the many purposes are
    listed here:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Enable in-depth data-driven decision making,
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain relationships and rationales,
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate behavioral and attitudinal information,
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide objectivity to findings,
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide credibility to findings,
    </li>
    <li>
        Link subjective factors such as attitudes with concrete, statistically-valid data,
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide the inputs to develop predictive models, and
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide reliable and proprietary data to the client.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Primary market research often is desirable because it is designed to address the specific issue of concern and derives
    data from a targeted set of respondents. This is as opposed to secondary market research, which might be appropriate
    when the information sought is in the public domain and detailed explanations to support the data are not needed.
</p>
<p>
    Research with a small, non-representative sample can be used for exploration of ideas, detailed explanations of
    respondent thoughts and/or directional guidance for decisions. However, by itself, research with a small sample can be
    misleading by potentially offering points of view that do not represent those of the market. Where this is a concern,
    research with a larger sample plays an important role in boosting confidence in the results. Ultimately, the size of
    the research effort must be appropriate for the level of risk involved. If the client has a great deal to lose as a
    result of misleading information (for example, if the client is using the research to guide a decision on launching a
    new brand), then a larger sample size is more appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Qualitative Research Approach</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    Qualitative research is most effective in providing explanations, first-hand perspectives and detailed descriptions
    from respondents. While it can be part of a large study, qualitative research is often used with smaller research
    samples to provide direction, explore possible hypotheses or follow-up on results from a large, quantitative study. In
    many cases, a business-to-business study will use a qualitative approach particularly if the market complexity is less
    than would be with consumers.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Quantitative Research Approach</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    Quantitative research enables the practitioner to conduct mathematical analyses, build models and quantify market or
    industry trends. Like qualitative research, quantitative methodology can be used with either large or small samples.
    Most often, quantitative research is conducted with large samples intended to represent the population be studied. This
    is particularly useful when the client wants to collect data to quantify behaviors, attitudes, opinions or other
    characteristics of an entire population in order to guide decision-making. Consumer studies often use a quantitative
    approach.

    The goal of market research usually is to mitigate risk in some way and this can be achieved by providing clear and
    actionable results.
</p>
<p>
    Though predominantly used in the marketing division of a firm, market research also may be used to determine
    operational best practices or as inputs to strategic planning. For purposes of this WPD, "primary market research" is
    considered to be external (marketplace or customer-oriented) or internal (within the firm) fact-finding or
    investigation to answer a given question(s) conducted using people as the information sources.
</p>
<p>
    Primary indicates the data or information has been drawn directly from the source. Primary market research is collected
    directly from representatives of a selected group of people specifically to address the research question(s).
    Representatives - also known as participants or respondents - can be customers, channel members, competitors,
    employees, analysts - anyone who possesses relevant answers to the clients’ questions. Primary data can be collected
    through observations, interviews, focus groups or surveys. Normally, because a primary market research study is
    designed to provide information for the decision(s) being made, it yields more actionable and focused results than
    secondary research might yield.
</p>
<p>
    By contrast, secondary research is considered any published information, reports or previous research in the public or
    private domain. The key element is that it is at least one generation removed from the root source.
</p>
<p>
    There are four questions which, when answered, help frame the research design for a client:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        What are the specific objectives that have motivated the client to commission/need the research for this situation?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the critical decisions that must be correctly made in order to meet those objectives?
    </li>
    <li>
        What critical questions must be answered, of what key groups of people, in order to arrive at the correct
        decisions?
    </li>
    <li>
        What particular research methods will produce thorough and accurate answers to the critical questions?
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    To best be able to answer these questions and design the research, there are two key components of market research to
    understand - the approaches to market research and sampling (or selection) of respondents.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Qualitative and Quantitative Research</b>
</p>
<p>
    Specific objectives should be developed before market research data collection or analysis takes place. The objectives
    will influence what research approach should be employed. There are two broad approaches: <b>qualitative</b> and
    <b>quantitative</b>. Each of these can be used in two manners to describe research.
</p>
<p>
    The first distinction is based on general assumptions about the number of people interviewed. Quantitative research
    refers to studies involving ‘a lot’ of people. It uses statistical average techniques such as mean ratings, and
    statistical tools such as sampling error and standard error to analyze data. There is no stated number of people who
    must be interviewed to make a study quantitative, but samples of 100 or more are usually considered quantitative. This
    leaves qualitative research, or studies involving a small number of individuals, such as focus groups or in-depth
    one-on-one interviews. The primary tool in qualitative research is the focus group, but it can also include modern
    variations on the focus group idea such as online focus groups and teleconferences. Qualitative researchers also use
    one-on-one interviews to delve deep into various topics.
</p>
<p>
    The second distinction between qualitative and quantitative deals with the type of outputs the research yields. When
    used to describe the outputs, qualitative means outputs are descriptive in nature because qualitative research
    endeavors to explain, describe and understand the attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, motivations, values, needs and
    emotions of respondents. Qualitative research is a valuable tool to assist in gaining in-depth, descriptive
    information. Because qualitative research is trying to uncover motivations and explanations, it typically must be
    collected directly from respondents. Most often, it takes the form of structured discussions through focus groups
    and/or one-on-one interviews, with many open-ended and probing questions but it also may take the form as open-ended
    questions in a questionnaire.
</p>
<p>
    Quantitative outputs, literally speaking, deliver results where the primary findings are numeric measurements. This
    type of research approach is best when the research objectives require validation, accurate measurements or numeric
    inputs to develop a predictive model. When numeric measurements are required research outputs, surveys are the best way
    to obtain the information. Surveys are advantageous to use because the rating, choice and/or ranking questions do not
    require explanation and the survey can be administered without a moderator. Quantitative research can be collected
    first-hand from primary sources or it may be available from a secondary source (e.g., secondary sources include
    customer data provided by a client).
</p>
<p>
    While qualitative and quantitative approaches tend to elicit different types of information, the two are often used
    together. Use of one research approach does not limit one’s capability to include elements of the other. One example is
    a focus group or in-depth interview, which includes a battery of rating questions. The ratings provide quantitative
    results but also provide a springboard to ask the respondent to explain his view.
</p>
<p>
    The following table explains some of the differences between qualitative and quantitative research approaches.

    confidence the practitioner can have in the data. A sample that is too small or unrepresentative of the target audience
    can lead to erroneous conclusions from misleading data. The trick is to include enough respondents to achieve the level
    of statistical confidence and reliability that is appropriate to meet the research objectives.
</p>
<p>
    [CDATA[Creating a proper sample is a complicated task. Complete books have been written and professions made in
    understanding, designing and conducting sampling.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to note that a large sample size does not necessarily guarantee a representative sample. To be
    representative of the larger population, the sample must include an adequate number of participants from each of the
    different groups within the population. For example, a sample of 1,000 moviegoers is large but will not be
    representative of the total audience for a movie if all 1,000 research participants are women. Larger samples provide
    the opportunity for representative research, but care must be taken to ensure the sample truly <u>represents</u> the
    population.
</p>
<p>
    In most cases for IBM practitioners, market research will be an input to a client deliverable. This WPD does not
    address the specific design techniques (choice of wording for questions, appropriateness of various data collection
    methodologies) or the analytic approaches to the various types of market research outputs.

    Depending upon the type of primary market research that will be gathered, the project will require a selection of the
    following elements:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Research Objectives (All)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Research objectives must be clearly defined so that the project is focused on specific outcomes. The research
    objectives must consider the following items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How the research supports the engagement or project objectives,&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        From whom or which resources is information required,<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the estimated budget (including data collection, incentives and sample cost)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the schedule or timeline, and<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Are there other business constraints, such as legal or regulatory limitations?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Analytic Plan (All)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The analytic plan is particularly relevant when conducting primary, or quantitative, research. It describes how the
    research objectives will be met and may have been developed as part of the proposal. It will typically include the
    following elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Market research technique(s) to be employed including any pre-testing,&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        High-level description of the market research approach,<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Descriptions and explanations of advanced analytic techniques,<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Target respondents and sampling plan (consult a SME in research sampling to ensure this is done correctly),<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Timelines and schedules,<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Vendor information and data collection logistics, and<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Engagement team project responsibilities.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following elements may not be required for every primary market research project:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Participant Screener (Interview, Focus Group)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The participant screener is a short questionnaire administered to potential participants to identify those who meet the
    requirements to participate in the interview, focus group or questionnaire. Depending on the research objectives, the
    screener may include questions about a variety of characteristics, such as residential location, product usage, income
    level, gender, employment, or any other relevant characteristics to ensure that only valid participants are invited to
    participate in the study. Screener questionnaires for focus groups or one-on-one interviews are addressed prior to
    scheduling the individuals to participate — a separate process from the actual research data collection.&nbsp; When
    research is conducted via a telephone, in-person or online questionnaire, it is normal procedure to integrate screening
    and data collection by writing the screening questions into the first part of the questionnaire. Those who do not meet
    the criteria can be thanked and immediately terminated.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Invitation (Interview, Focus Group)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    At the time it is determined that a person successfully meets the screening criteria for a focus group or interview, an
    invitation can be extended to participate in the study. When invited, the potential participant must know what is
    expected – the length of time to which he is committing, a general idea of the research topic and any logistical
    requirements (focus group location, parking, conference call-in number, etc.). People who participate in market
    research studies are often compensated with an “incentive” – cash, products, or charitable donations. Incentives for
    focus groups or interviews generally range between $50-300 USD per participant and are paid at the conclusion of the
    research. Opportunities to participate in a monthly sweepstakes or a gift certificate for use at an online vendor are
    increasingly used to encourage participation in online research. The amount and type of incentive varies among research
    projects, depending factors such as the geographical location (metro area vs. rural), time requirement for research,
    professional level of the participant.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Research Instrument (All)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A research instrument, typically a discussion guide or a survey, is developed to efficiently obtain the desired
    information from the target audience. The instrument must be designed to support the stated research objectives and fit
    within the time commitments made to participants.
</p>
<p>
    The moderator’s guide for a focus group or one-on-one interview guide is written to provide structure, consistency
    among interviewers, and a natural flow to the discussion. The qualitative instrument will be a list of open-ended
    questions to which the respondent provides explanative responses. The most common format for a quantitative survey
    instrument is a series of pre-determined, structured and sequenced questions with a choice of pre-established responses
    from which to choose.
</p>
<p>
    Developing valid and unbiased research instruments is a specialized skill (IBM has SMEs who can assist with this). The
    instrument must be carefully worded and structured in order to eliminate the possibility of biasing responses or lead
    to responses that are not actionable. A client will provide input to the questions (and may have certain questions
    asked regularly which they desire to include) but should not write the survey instrument.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Data Output (All)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Data output from qualitative studies can be interview transcripts, notes, quotes and even some aggregated scores or
    ratings if such questions were included in the discussion guide. However, numeric outputs should include, clearly
    noted, the limited number of respondents in order to avoid the inference that the respondent base was statistically
    sound.
</p>
<p>
    Data output from quantitative studies always can be presented in data tables (or ‘tabs’ or ‘cross tabs’) with each
    question at the top of the page and the percentage of respondents giving each response listed down the left-hand side
    of the page. Tables are useful because they show frequencies of certain responses and when the responses for certain
    respondent segments are statistically larger or smaller than for other respondent segments. For many research projects,
    this output will enable the analysis required to meet the objectives of the study.
</p>
<p>
    When dependencies and relationships need to be understood, a variety of statistical methods and calculations may be
    conducted yielding outputs, which may be difficult for someone other than an SME to decipher. Advanced analyses outputs
    may range from the intermediate step of scores and ratios that may need to be interpreted from their raw format to
    charts, graphs and findings statements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Analysis and Findings (All)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Analysis of the data collected in the study is required to draw sound conclusions and make valid recommendations. In
    the case of qualitative research, the findings tend to be more general in nature, reflecting the attitudes, beliefs,
    and opinions captured during the study. In quantitative studies, more rigorous analysis can be performed on the
    numerical data to judge the significance, dependence, interdependence and relationships between the data and variables.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    As professionals, we must strive to collect relevant, objective and representative data so we can deliver the most
    compelling, sound, and objective recommendations to our clients.&nbsp; Asking good questions can help the client
    realize what he doesn’t know. Often it is necessary to use the data that currently exist in the client organization to
    answer as many questions as possible and show the need for additional market research. Some sample questions are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How do your customers differ from your key competitors’ customers?
    </li>
    <li>
        What complementors are valued by your customers?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are drivers of satisfaction and loyalty among your target customers? What is the relative importance of each
        driver?
    </li>
    <li>
        What investments can you make to close the gaps between company performance and customer expectations?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the market potential for the new product or service you are about to introduce? What is customers’
        willingness to pay?
    </li>
    <li>
        How do your customers view your brand and how does that differ from their views of your competitors?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Primary market research should not be undertaken without the involvement of market research specialists.
</p>
<p>
    Client will often seek to rely on their experience and knowledge of an industry and/or market, rather than collecting
    primary market data.&nbsp; When a client engagement requires a first-hand understanding of the target audience, it is
    important to recommend strongly that primary market research be conducted.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research Scope</strong> – In addition to having a qualitative or quantitative
    approach to any research, qualitative and quantitative can refer overall to the scope of the research. Oftentimes,
    those familiar with market research will refer to focus groups or interviews as qualitative even though these
    approaches may include quantitative methodologies. Similarly, surveys may include qualitative questions to try to
    understand reasons and rationales behind other answers. When the scope of a study is called qualitative, it may refer
    to the fact that the overall number of respondents participating in the research is too few to allow the study to be
    statistically projectible or reliable. Those with frequently work with primary research, may use the term quantitative
    to denote that enough respondents have contributed to the research to make it statistically valid and applicable to the
    broader population.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Qualitative Research Advantages and Disadvantages</strong> –&nbsp; Advantages are that this can be done
        fairly quickly and reasonably for the client, leveraging secondary data and a limited number of primary
        sources.&nbsp; Disadvantages can include too few resources for research, lack of available secondary data for
        validation and scope creep.&nbsp; Having clearly defined objectives will help limit the amount of time spent
        researching the objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Quantitative Research Advantages and Disadvantages</strong> – Advantages include a comprehensive sampling
        of the target market, opportunities to explore additional options and compare market segment responses.&nbsp;
        Disadvantages can include the time and cost to the client, as well as the level of expertise required to develop
        and implement a statistically valid research project.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Questionnaires and focus group research studies of consumer audiences often are conducted off-hours (nights and
    weekends) in order to facilitate participation by the target audience. When one-on-one interviews are the means of data
    collection (as normally is done for business people), often the interviews will be conducted during, prior to or at the
    close of the business day.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, an objective third party conducts the research where the respondents do not know the identity of the
    sponsoring company (typically referred to as a “blind”). Trained professionals should conduct the study (moderators,
    phone or in-person interviewers) because even a properly worded instrument can lead to biased responses if the person
    collecting the data leads or otherwise influences the participants’ responses.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sampling and representativeness</strong> – In nearly every case of primary research, surveying the entire
    market (e.g. a census) is infeasible because of cost, time and money. Therefore, “sampling” is a means to identify a
    much smaller but representative sample of the population from whom to collect information and then project the
    information back to the total population.&nbsp; Statistical methods allow us to analyze a sample and determine the
    level of confidence we can have in the representative ness of that sample; this makes a census unnecessary.&nbsp; There
    are a number of methods to sample a population; consult an SME or research vendor to assist with establishing a
    sampling methodology.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Survey instrument design</strong> – There are many types of questions and approaches that can be used to
    achieve the required information. Whether someone is literally asking the questions or the survey is self-administered
    on a computer or through a Web site, poor wording, form, question type and sequence of the questions all can have an
    impact on the data that are collected and potentially make the data biased or less valid. IBM has SMEs in the Business
    and Customer Strategy practice that can assist in instrument design, as can many research vendors.
</p>
<p>
    Interviewer fatigue and adequate note-taking time should be considered when scheduling the time required to conduct
    data collection via interviews. Even for short one-half hour interviews with a note-taker, allow time for interviewees
    to arrive late, for interviewees to be long-winded, to discuss the key points with the note-taker and to write down key
    points from the interview. It is unrealistic to set an on-going pace of 7 or more one-half hour interviews a day for a
    single consultant.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Vendor procurement</strong> – IBM has approved vendors for external market research. If you choose to outsource
    all research logistics, ensure someone has constant contact with the vendor to ensure everything is progressing on
    schedule.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Internal Surveys within IBM</strong> – Any survey which is to be administered to IBM employees must be approved
    through the Employee Survey Registry
    Team&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Confidentiality</strong> – It is important that respondents provide their true opinions and feelings when they
    participate in research. One way to encourage this openness is to keep all responses confidential and never attribute
    responses to any individual. Some respondents will not agree to participate in research without this assurance.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>‘Blind’ versus ‘Open’ study</strong> – Another way to ensure that respondents provide their true opinions is to
    keep the research sponsor anonymous. Research participants may feel biased – positively or negatively – toward the
    sponsor and that may influence their responses during the interview or survey. Upon concluding the study, sometimes the
    sponsor is revealed. Very few people will refuse to participate in research because they do not know who is sponsoring
    the research.
</p>
<p>
    Before beginning any study, it is imperative that the consultant verifies the research objectives with the client.
    Validation, and how it is accomplished, will differ based on whether qualitative or quantitative data were
    collected.&nbsp; In the case of primary research, care must be given to ensure that the study included a valid sample,
    a non-biased research instrument, and professional execution.&nbsp; See <a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/concepts/good_market_research_8206345D.html" guid="_i1H0kDmUEd2-CubhO68cXA">Characteristics of Good Market Research</a>
