<p>
    <img height="404" alt="" src="./../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/pednot.JPG" width="447" /><br />
    <br />
    <b>Business Process Enabler and System Functionality Matrix</b>
</p>
<p>
    Using a similar “matrixing” technique shown above, tie process enablers to system functionality (applications).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Package/Technology Course Description & Schedule</b>
</p>
<p>
    A course is a complete series of related studies that satisfy the learning requirements for one competency. It is
    backed up by courseware such as training kits, process documentation, and help materials for implementing the
    course.<br />
    See&nbsp;Examples.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Course Module Definitions</b>
</p>
<p>
    Course modules are independent, reusable components used in conjunction with one another for building courses. Course
    module definitions briefly describe course modules by specifying the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Module name. This is the unique identifier for this course component.
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus. This is the subject of the module, such as an elementary business process, derived logical process, skill,
        unit of knowledge, or behavior.
    </li>
    <li>
        Objective. This is the performance learners should exhibit as proof that learning has taken place.
    </li>
    <li>
        Delivery strategy. This is the mechanism for offering the module; that is, training, process documentation, or help
        materials.
    </li>
    <li>
        Learning measure. This determines whether the module achieves its objective. Common ways for gauging the degree to
        which stakeholders learn are through tests, observation, exercise results, and rating scales.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Course Ingredient Definitions</b>
</p>
<p>
    These identify the following elements a course must address in order to transfer skills, knowledge, and behaviors to
    its learners:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Facts. These are terms related to the specific skill, unit of knowledge, or behavior being addressed. For example,
        a Course Ingredient Definition might define the term "wholesale order."
    </li>
    <li>
        Concepts. These state the relationships between facts, such as cause and effect. For example, a Course Ingredient
        Definition might define retail pricing versus wholesale pricing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Principles. These are the implications of facts and concepts. The course must convey these principles in order to
        make course content meaningful. For example, a Course Ingredient Definition might include the following principle:
        "The mark-up is less for wholesale orders than for retail orders because there are no distribution channels to
        maintain."
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Course Ingredient / Course Module Matrix</b>
</p>
<p>
    This identifies the ingredients for which each module is responsible and documents module scope by recording
    involvement indicators in the intersecting cells.<br />
    Using a similar “matrixing” technique shown above, tie course ingredients to course modules. This will help in the
    development of the course content.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Course modules</b>
</p>
<p>
    Course modules include the following components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Training modules. These include:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lesson plan. This is an instructional blueprint describing instructor and learner activities for reaching
                module objectives. The "instructor" may be a person, computer program, or whatever is appropriate to the
                delivery method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Student guide. The student guide typically contains presentation images, learner notes, and practice
                instructions. It may be printed, recorded, or presented for viewing on a screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Instructor guide. Given that the "instructor" may be a person, computer program, or whatever is appropriate
                to the delivery method, the instructor guide specifies the instructor's role in module delivery. This will
                include special instructions, solutions to practice exercises, use of visual aids, likely issue areas,
                probing questions for audience, anecdotes and references. It usually follows the structure of the student
                guide.
            </li>
            <li>
                Process Documentation and Help Modules. These are devices for extending the learner's memory beyond
                training or for providing information in lieu of training. Examples include procedure manuals (printed,
                recorded, or computerized), quick-reference materials, telephone help lines, application help screens,
                coaching specifications, and electronic information exchanges. These modules are not intended to be works
                of art. Meeting specifications, being useful, and providing control over the business process are more
                important than appearance.<br />

    <b>Education Case Studies</b>
</p>
<p>
    A Case Study is a complex exercise that is reality-based and offers practice using multiple skills, units of knowledge,
    and behaviors together. One or more sample solutions are included for learners to review. This work product expands as
    new courses are developed and existing ones are modified.
</p>
<p>
    The standards for developing case study material vary with the medium used-a Case Study might be paper-based,
    conversational, or human-machine interactive.

    Many ingredients go into determining the approach and sequence for developing initial education and education
    materials. First, recognize that there is no such thing as the correct education plan. Your choice of learning options
    will vary with such factors as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Learner Demographics</strong>.&nbsp; Learner demographics are the individual and group characteristics over
        which you have little or no control, such as stakeholder age and years of service. You compiled stakeholder
        demographics when assessing the current organization. Review them now to determine how they might affect your
        education plan. For instance, you may want to identify learners’ current experience and their average and median
        levels of education if they need to acquire new and challenging skills.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Number of Learners</strong>. The learning mechanisms you choose may depend on how many people you must
        reach in the given time period.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Frequency of Use</strong>.&nbsp; The number of times course content will be used within a given time period
        determines the appropriate level of access to educational materials.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Time Constraints</strong>. Limitations on development and delivery time may eliminate some learning
        options.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Targeted Level of Expertise</strong>. The value of each learning option varies with the level of competency
        you are aiming for.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Project Budget</strong>. Certain learning options are more expensive to develop than others. There is a
        trade-off, however, between short-term and long-term costs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Shelf Life</strong>. You may wish to use fewer resources to develop educational materials that will quickly
        become obsolete or no longer necessary. When estimating shelf life, consider anticipated learner turnover.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Available Education Facilities</strong>. Some learning options may require a development or delivery
        environment currently unavailable.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The learning options themselves are affected by each other and by the technologies chosen for use in the solution
    implementation. Some options may have a greater resource of education than others, such as product training and
    documentation.&nbsp; A comprehensive instructional program may reduce the need for reference material in general.
</p>
<p>
    Remember that there is more to learning than sitting through a regimen of prescribed courseware. Learning also involves
    informal education, such as coaching and mentoring.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of striving for a particular balance or number of course graduates, aim for getting targeted populations to
    behave competently in their assigned roles. Consider all ingredients together and make high-level trade-offs between
    them. Where possible, provide quantitative guidelines to aid decisions about the level of investment to be made in any
    category. For example, you may want to spend more on training for a process that will be used by one person 10,000
    times a month than on one that will be used by 100 people 20 times a month.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>In addition, the following guidance is recommended:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Focused training approach means selecting the necessary functions from the standard package modules, assets or
        technologies that pertain to the specific client, rather than giving standard training for all available standard
        functionality.&nbsp; Later some configuration of the training system and data migration has to be done in order to
        ensure that the training is focused on the client's business.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The focused training should be conducted by the Solution Architects.
    </li>
    <li>
        The training must cover the required capabilities and performance of the future business processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        The functionality that the training focuses on should be limited to the business processes that will be impacted by
        the package or technology and the specific functions that the package or technology will be enabling. This allows
        the client to focus only on the functionality necessary for his company, making the education of the project team
        more efficient and goal oriented.
    </li>
    <li>
        To conduct the focused training it is necessary that time is allocated to do the necessary system configuration and
        user representative data set up.
    </li>
    <li>
        To plan the focused training, collect the following information:&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">

    Without a proper understanding of the business process enablers and the technologies planned for use in the solution
    implementation, it will be difficult for the Client's team members to participate in the development of the future

    understand the opportunities and limitations of the planned technologies and business process enablers
    (people/technology).
