    The purpose of the Hypothesis and Data Framework is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide a structured approach to establish a baseline or definition of an ideal end-state for a client capability
        or set of capabilities
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the baseline to probe the client for an assessment of their current abilities in reference to their desired
        capability
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the facts that need to be collected to prove or disprove the hypotheses
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify relevant sources of information needed to evaluate the client’s position relative to their desired state
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the results of the framework to estimate resources and time required to complete the hypothesis analysis
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the results of completing the collection of facts and proving/disproving the hypotheses to develop
        recommendations to close the gaps for hypotheses that were disproved
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This work product is useful for bringing structure to an unstructured business problem. It assists the engagement team
    in leading the client through an understanding of a desired capability state and the high level requirements needed to
    support the ideal state.

    This work product&nbsp;is used to establish a baseline for an ideal (e.g. end-state) situation. Using issue-based
    consulting techniques and this work product, a gap between a desired state and an actual state is developed. The
    following are examples of client situations which may be addressed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Determine gaps between a client’s business strategy and ideal customer-centered strategy
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the gaps between a client’s current capabilities and the end-state described in a customer-centered
        strategy
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the gaps between a client’s current infrastructure (capability-enablers: process, organization, and/or
        technology) and those required to support a desired end-state capability
    </li>
    <li>
        Establish the detailed scope of an engagement through the use of hypotheses and the data required to support or
        refute the hypotheses
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine client’s level of understanding of a desired capability. Is there a clear understanding of terminology
        and concepts related to the capability? Do all client divisions affected by a capability agree to its purpose,
        scope and influence?
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine client’s readiness to undertake a desired capability. What gaps exist in required processes,
        organization, technology, or data?
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluate the level of consensus and support for any recommended next steps or actions. Are client groups who must
        work together to successfully implement a capability ready to do so? Do they have a common understanding of the
        overall approach to be used?
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the sources (e.g. personnel to be interviewed, etc) within the client to validate the current level of a
        capability or a capability enabler in the infrastructure (i.e.. process, organization or technology described in
        the end-state hypotheses)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The hypotheses are typically tested by asking the client a series of supporting questions to challenge the original
    statements of fact. Under the presumption that most clients are not able to affirm all the hypotheses, the use of the
    <b>Hypothesis and Data Framework</b> work product is generally extended to determine the facts, organizational data
    sources, system data sources and methods of capture required to confirm or refute the hypotheses. The results of the
    <b>Hypothesis and Data Framework</b> are then used to estimate staffing, level of effort and duration requirements to
    close the gaps between the reality of the statements of fact and the actual situation.

        The objective of this work product is to determine the client’s view of the hypotheses and identify the data needed
        to validate the hypotheses.&nbsp;&nbsp; This work product establishes a starting point for a typical consulting
        engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
        A second objective of the work product is to obtain consensus within the client organization surrounding the
        hypotheses and data sources.&nbsp; Significantly varying conclusions or results around any one hypothesis should
        suggest to the engagement team that further investigative work is required to determine the true state of
        affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        This work product can be very effectively used to determine the scope of downstream engagements. For example, if a
        key hypothesis cannot be validated or refuted but is determined to be critical to the nature of the investigation
        (e.g. determining a client’s readiness for establishing customer loyalty processes), a related but separate
        engagement could be scoped to focus on obtaining additional information regarding just the hypothesis in question.
        This work product provides a structure under which the client can be led to draw their own conclusions and action
        items.
    </li>
    <li>
        This work product can also be used to determine gaps in the client’s processes, organization, technology or data
        required to enable the capability under investigation.&nbsp; Based on the size of the gap, this work product can be
        used to establish a detailed, methodical work plan to obtain the information to close the gap.<br />

    If a <b>Hypothesis and Data Framework</b> is not produced, the following difficulties may occur:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The ideal end-state of a capability may not be sufficiently defined to bound an engagement or an assessment. As a
        result, the engagement scope can expand
    </li>
    <li>
        Without the framework structure, critical information required to support or refute a hypothesis can be overlooked
    </li>
    <li>
        Without the framework, it may not be apparent that the same client contact person is the "source" of information
        regarding multiple hypotheses or fact-finding questions, resulting in client dissatisfaction when repeatedly
        approached, piece-meal, by several engagement team members pursuing different hypotheses
