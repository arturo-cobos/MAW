    The purpose of a Marketing Communications Strategy work product is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Enable effective communication of information to key audiences
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a framework for tactical efforts; e.g., loyalty programs, sponsorships, third-party promotions, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure consistency of messages across marketing communications disciplines.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The communication or message may or may not be as simple as telling customers about a new product or service, or asking
    them to do something they already do in a different way. If, for example, a brand’s values have changed, its new values
    will need to be clearly communicated in order to effectively re-position it within the marketplace.
</p>
<p>
    If an existing product, service or process has been revised or upgraded, it may offer the customer or user additional
    benefits or require a change in actions or behaviours. Clear communication is essential to ensure that change and new
    processes are accepted and implemented in the way that the client requires.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Main Description</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    The Marketing Communications Strategy provides the framework for an integrated and consistent delivery of messages
    across disciplines, channels and formats - from the look and tone of advertising and direct marketing, to the content
    of company brochures and executive speeches, to the way customer service responds to a complaint. The general thinking
    is that an integrated marketing communications effort has a greater persuasive impact because of the synergies it
    creates. Taking a holistic view of marketing communications also allows a review of how a company uses each discipline
    and in what proportion.
</p>
<p>
    The Marketing Communications Strategy also defines the specific message(s) to be delivered to each target audience. The
    content of the message may communicate the value proposition, support the brand, educate and guide behaviours or a
    combination of all three. The message itself should be engaging, outline the benefits and in some instances provoke an
    action (e.g. visit a Web site, tell a friend or clients, phone the call centre, realign partner communications
    strategies, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    But a Marketing Communications Strategy is not just about delivering the right message to the right audience - it’s
    also about learning from the market. Communication should be a two-way process - where target audience opinions
    (feedback), behaviours and requirements not only influence the initial messages and activities, but also provide a
    baseline upon which to measure the success of the communications effort.
</p>
<p>
    The Marketing Communications Strategy should be aligned with the client’s overall Marketing Plan; indeed it should be a
    critical driver of many initiatives within this plan. While it is likely that the strategy is owned the client’s
    marketing area, a successful Marketing Communications Strategy has buy-in across the business arena, including the
    client’s entire internal audience, suppliers and partners.

        It is important not to undertake this type of work without referring to internal specialists in the Marketing
        Strategy or Digital Brand & Marketing practice.
    </li>
    <li>
        The key dependencies stated earlier may be considered showstoppers.&nbsp; To undertake a commitment to deliver this
        work product without access to this type of information could be considered a risk to the success of the initiative
        and the client brand.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the Marketing Communications Strategy is built around a clear set of objectives.&nbsp; The client
        should have a clear idea what it will be achieved, how and by when.
    </li>
    <li>
        Manage expectations.&nbsp; Ensure that the client understands what can and cannot be achieved by a Marketing
        Communications Strategy. Areas where particular attention should be given include:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Promises of increased sales&nbsp;

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Impact of not having</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Without a consistent Marketing Communications Strategy, the client risks miscommunicating with its intended target
    audiences, which may have negative results, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Disjointed communications leave the audience with mixed messages about the brand and its products such that they
        "take away" completely the wrong message.
    </li>
    <li>
        The messages from the brand are ambiguous and open to interpretation by staff, customers, partners, etc., and
        provide no clear signals of direction or positioning
    </li>
    <li>
        Unclear or unfocused messages dilute the brand - sending out no clear signals of direction or positioning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of understanding. The audience may not be sophisticated enough to interpret the client’s actions alone. "Don’t
        expect everyone to guess correctly - spell it out for them."

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    There may be valid reasons for omitting the Marketing Communications Strategy work product from IBM engagements. Some
    example situations have been outlined below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        IBM has been engaged to perform a strategic opportunity analysis and marketplace assessment. No opportunity has yet
        been identified to warrant a Marketing Communications Strategy. This however, would only delay the use, not rule it
        out.
    </li>
    <li>
        IBM has been engaged to deliver a technical solution only. There is no scope for moving up into the business
        environment, and/or the team is engaged with entirely the wrong client audience. However, approaching the client
        with business intelligence solutions, such as data mining or CRM could open the door to this type of project.
