    The Financial Practices work product provides information about the current position within a client and is broadly
    used as the baseline from which a subsequent assessment of a clients financial practices can be made and appropriate
    improvement / development conclusions and recommendations determined. The information that makes up this work product
    can be varied in both depth and breadth depending upon the context of the engagement. Examples of content and use are
    illustrated below.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understand current cost and value linkages to both business and IT strategy ensuring that client activities and
        performance is in sync with strategic direction and underpinning requirements (desired strategic framework).

        Appreciate current costs from budgets and interviews that can subsequently feed into a cost model in order to drive
        enhanced efficiencies
    </li>
    <li>
        Appreciate current IT accounting tools, techniques, practices and organization in order to appreciate feasibility
        and complexity involved in improving or developing service pricing and charging to the clients of IT
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand current cost management tools, process and automation to allow for continual efficiency monitoring and
        improvement

    <li>
        Appreciate tools and techniques used in prioritizing potential investments to ensure that the most likely outcomes
        are reflected and appropriate investments chosen

        Obtain financials associated with the current project portfolio to ensure that it is both appropriately prioritized
        and optimized for return on investment

</ul>
<p>
    In essence information required from the current organization is taken to drive forward assessments and ultimate
    conclusions and recommendations that can positively impact one or a number of the following areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To be cost efficient without compromising the organizations ability to deliver appropriate products and services
    </li>
    <li>
        To invest in projects, services and technologies that will optimize both fiscal and non-fiscal returns to the
        organization
    </li>
    <li>
        To be aligned to strategy in terms of cost and value management and have an ability to be both pro-active and to

                organizational units. Often the budget is wrapped into an overall operational plan that details policies,
                resources, activities and plans in more detail.

                Accounting generally utilizes historic costing rules, basically this means that when monetary measurement
                is taken it records transactions at their original cost, and ignores subsequent price or value changes such
                as say those resulting from inflation.

                Costs behave in different ways. This is one way of classifying costs. Variable costs are those that vary as
                business activity increases or decreases. (E.g. sales commission, expenses). Fixed costs on the other hand
                remain constant over variation of business activity. (E.g. salaries and insurance) Note that over time all
                costs eventually become variable.

                <br />
                Opportunity and sunk costs are investment considerations. Opportunity costs consider the cost of making a
                project investment compared to placing the same funds in a ‘safe’ investment, generally some form of
                savings account or government bond. A sunk cost is an investment that has already been made and cannot be
                considered as part of a future investment decision.

                These are methods of identifying costs related directly to production. FIFO – first in first out is an
                accounting pricing method, which considers charging the oldest stock to production first. Alternatively
                LIFO – Last in first out, the latest prices are used to charge goods out to production. Weighted average
                uses an average price of stock to charge to production, this could be either a continuous method or fixed
                as a periodic weighted average.

                versions of gross and net profit converted to % terms.

                be able to trend and compare with previous periods and other organizations. Examples of other common
                profitability ratios are current asset ratio that considers a companies level of debt i.e. liquidity, stock
                turnover ratio that gives an indication of company operating efficiency and earnings per share which is one
                example of many investment ratios that puts profits into a context of the markets view of its stock.

                I.e. when returns minus investment costs = 0. Payback is therefore expressed in terms of time e.g. months,
                quarters, years etc.

                Portfolio management can be confusing. It is most commonly used to refer to a portfolio of investments
                within a money market context. Within our area of interest portfolio has two references. The first is that
                of the pool of projects / developments that a company is investing in or proposing to invest in, to enhance
                the value of the corporation and its operations. The second is that of the list of services or products
                that a company currently provides in order to generate funds and revenues for the ongoing existence and
                profitability of the company.

                Relevance is critical in finance and accounting, where a plethora of information exists that could be
                collected. However only that data relevant to the users of the information should be collected. Materiality
                is also associated with this, an example of the latter is that clearly reporting the cost of a single pen
                in an aggregated $10m service procurement is absolutely not material or relevant. Materiality considers
                reporting on items that are significant. Prudence on the other hand considers being conservative, something
                we all need to do when considering the returns on an investment compared to the cost of that investment.
                These last terms are really only included to act as a principles guide when undertaking any cost and value
                work.

    As with all data collection activities it is critical to collate the correct data and appropriate volume of data
    required for the subsequent assessment activities.
</p>
<p>
    When determining the type and quantity of data required, the following should also be considered and reviewed during
    data collection activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Client requirements and objectives of the engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scope of the engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Timescales to engagement completion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The easiest thing to do is collect too much data, by doing this you run the risk of delaying engagement completion and
    potentially impacting customer satisfaction and / or reducing effective profit margins on your engagement. Data
    collection is a very time consuming activity.
</p>
<p>
    It is better to identify and collect data in an initial data collection pass knowing that as you progress through
    assessment and data synthesis you will need to obtain more focused data as unforeseen information requirements
    invariably occur during engagements. So long as a client is made fully aware of this potential upfront, this should not
    provide major issues downstream.
</p>
<p>
    Often a client does not have all the data required. This needs to be firmly investigated upfront. As such you need to
    have a good understanding of data required for the engagement at the proposal stage. Clearly define what data the
    client will provide you and the implications if they cannot do so. After all data creation (which is what you have to
    perform if data is not available) is a much more time consuming event than data collection. Data creation (i.e.
    measurement and in-depth interviews to obtain required data) may significantly increase time to engagement completion
    and therefore cost to client OR alternatively losses to you if this is not factored in.
</p>
<p>
    There is a plethora of terminology covering the area of finance. Such terminology can also vary greatly by country and
    region. Some specific language related to accounting is described within the IT Accounting work product. There is also
    a list of books within the references section of this work product that can help in this area. Some terminology as it
    applies to basic cost and value is included in this section but even this combined with IT Accounting work product is
    simply a flavor of the language of finance that you may come across. As such it is critical that only professionals
    that are IT Cost and Value trained or have a financial background undertake the development of this work product.<br />

such undertakings tie in to the strategy, then there is no basis from which to understand what changes and improvements
could or should be made. This is equally true if you cannot capture through appropriate tools and subsequently measure
financials in terms of costs or benefits. In essence you cannot improve what you can’t control or measure. Without this
work product you and the client will not know how the organization currently performs cost and value management and
therefore do not have a baseline by which to assess and develop conclusions and recommendations in this area.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell">This work product is generally produced when the engagement has a very business / commercially oriented perspective
irrespective of the content of the engagement, or if the engagement is actually about how a client improves or develops
their ability to manage cost and value. This work product should not be produced if: 
<ul>
    <li>
        This information is already known or;
    </li>
    <li>
        The client has confidence that such information or subsequent assessment is not needed or;
    </li>
    <li>
        The cost of obtaining the information outweighs the benefits.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The last point covers a danger in the application of cost and value. It is critical to ensure that the client
    appreciates the benefit and desires the application of cost and value elements to an engagement where cost and value is
    not the main topic (i.e. e-business transformation, service delivery improvement, systems integration etc).
</p>
<p>
    Failure to appreciate the client’s position with respect to this places IBM’s reputation, your reputation and client
    satisfaction in jeopardy. For instance:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Speed of implementation may be a big factor and client does not want to be sidelined from this by undertaking any
        activities that could hinder progress.
    </li>
    <li>
        Politically and fiscally a decision may have already been made compromising this would be counter to the clients
        requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        The cost of the engagement may be a major factor and the client may not be prepared to add to the cost by
        performing cost and value activities.
    </li>
</ul>By all means always explore the potential and need for cost and value analysis but only pursue if there is a
substantiated client requirement in this area.</td>
