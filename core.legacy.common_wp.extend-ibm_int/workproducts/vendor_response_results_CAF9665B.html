<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Brief Outline</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    The Vendor Response Results and Shortlist provides a summary view of each vendor’s ability to meet the functional,
    general, and technical requirements desired by the client in their software solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; It begins with the
    completed Requirements Matrix with additional spreadsheets. The additional spreadsheets detail the decision model and
    summary results of the vendor responses.
</p>
<p>
    Vendors respond by populating the Requirements Matrix using a scoring model to indicate their ability to satisfy the
    functional, technical, and general requirements with the current release of their software.&nbsp; A comments section is
    included to describe anticipated enhancements (& release dates), customizations, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Vendors score their software using the following model:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>2</strong> - Now Standard: Supported in Current Version
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>1</strong> - Planned as Standard: Definitely Supported in Next Release
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>0</strong> - Not Supported or Planned: Requires Custom Modifications
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Vendors are able to provide additional detail to each requirement to clarify their response using the "Comments" column
    within each worksheet.
</p>
<p>
    The Vendor Response Summary should consist of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Title Page
    </li>
    <li>
        Completed Requirements Matrix
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Requirements Matrix Excel Workbook should be completed in its entirety.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Decision Model Worksheet
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                An Excel spreadsheet should be created to reflect the scoring decision model created with the client.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Summary Results Worksheet
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                An Excel spreadsheet should be created to reflect the vendor scores by each component of the
                Requirements.&nbsp; It should follow the scoring method determined in the decision model.&nbsp; As part of
                the results summary, it is suggested that a percentage performance is reflected by each business area or
                evaluation component.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The information from the vendor response results analysis can then be displayed in a text document, via spreadsheet
    tables, or as a presentation.&nbsp; However, the main advantage of the work product at this point is to take the client
    through the process of the shortlist selection; therefore, the presentation format seems to be the preferred approach
    to creating this interactive discussion session.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The main sections of the work product for the presentation would include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Cover Sheet
    </li>
    <li>
        Table of Contents
    </li>
    <li>
        List of Interim Vendors
    </li>
    <li>
        Vendor Elimination (Who and Why)
    </li>
    <li>
        RFI/RFP Results
    </li>
    <li>
        Preliminary Cost Models
    </li>
    <li>
        Vendor Analysis (Pros and Cons of Shortlist Vendors)
    </li>
    <li>
        Calendar of Demonstration Weeks and Vendors
    </li>
    <li>
        Next Steps
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Again, since the format can vary according to ones preference, a standard template is not used.<br />

    The decision or scoring model determined to assess the vendor scores should emphasize the key business areas and
    process existing in or desired for the client environment.&nbsp; It should match the level of depth determined in the
    business process definition task and subsequent meetings with client management.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Again, the format of this work product can vary tremendously.&nbsp; The content emphasized for a client presentation is
    recommended as a subset of the analysis material to present.&nbsp; The consultant should add any research information
    that is unique to the client, industry, or solution that would differentiate one solution vendor from another.&nbsp;
    The important outcome, however reached, is to gain the client’s agreement that the vendors on the shortlist are the
    correct vendors to invite in for demonstrations.
</p>
<p>
    The Vendor Response Results portion of this work product should be validated by checking the vendor responses to the
    Requirements Matrix to the scores listed in the decision model spreadsheet.&nbsp; The summary worksheet should be
    validated with the client team lead to ensure agreement on the decision model weights.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, this work product should provide the necessary detail to lead the client executive team through the
    process and the justification of selecting which vendors should be considered in detail for the client solution.&nbsp;
    The document recommendations should be validated by the client for completeness to avoid the client coming back later
    and questioning why certain vendors were eliminated.
</p>
<p>
    In most cases, the Vendor Response Results and Shortlist will be presented to the client team.&nbsp; It is necessary
    that the client agrees with the shortlist findings and that they consider the list complete.&nbsp; This verification at
    this point will avoid having them second-guess the process and vendors consideration in the latter stages of the
    engagement.<br />

    Without the advantage of the Vendor Response Results and Shortlist work product, the client may always be questioning
    why other vendors were not selected to conduct demonstrations. Since the work product provides a vehicle for defining
    the best vendors for their environment, the lack of this work product may leave the client open to still be considering
    or wondering about other solutions or vendors.
</p>
<p>
    One of the main advantages of the work product is to lead the client through the thought process behind the shortlist
    selection. Without the work product, the client may not understand why certain vendors were chosen or eliminated.
</p></td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell">Perhaps the only reason to not include this work product would be if the client has already done a shortlist selection and
a RFI/RFP was not issued. In some cases, the client has already had other consulting groups perform this work, or the
organization has outlined standards that need to be followed. In either case, if the client has a shortlist of vendors that
he will only consider for demonstrations, then the process can start with the scheduling of those vendors and this work
product will not be used.</td>
