<div class="sectionHeading">Key Considerations</div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><ul>
    <li>
        Imaging technology is changing rapidly.&nbsp; Before making a decision on how to create, store, or deploy images
        you should check the IBM web sites for up to date information.&nbsp; Options exist that break from the norm of a
        customized image being a static hardware-specific item.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A Customized Software Image Configuration Checklist should be used whenever possible.&nbsp; Such items as the
        version numbers of applications, encryption level, drive partition sizes, and desktop icons should be included.
        This will record what was important and tested by the client prior to the delivery of their image.&nbsp; It will
        also give the client an opportunity to review what will be included on all deployed machines.&nbsp; Creating this
        list is usually more difficult than creating the custom image, and as such elicits closer scrutiny by the
        client.&nbsp; The more detailed the list the less likely an oversight will occur.&nbsp; Have the client project
        manager sign off on this list.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make certain that all models that will be deployed have been tested with their images under the same conditions
        that will exist at the integration center and at the client deployment site.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Be aware of slight model or type changes to the received equipment.&nbsp; A bios or CD drive change could cause the
        custom image to fail.&nbsp; Suppliers may not notify you of changes with the order.&nbsp; Plan and budget for
        alterations to occur.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Establish with the client what types and degrees of equipment changes are acceptable and what types need
        authorization.&nbsp; Factories can alter the configuration of the ordered equipment within certain parameters in
        order to keep up with demand, because of upgrades, and because of changes in suppliers.&nbsp; They may not notify
        you of some of these alterations.&nbsp; Be clear with the client and the supplier what is acceptable and what is
        not.&nbsp; As the middleman in this transaction the risk is all yours unless you have set up clear parameters and
        transferred the risk to other parties.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Certain types of file formats have been developed specifically for duplication and may provide some value when
        deploying CD based images.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Test every version of the image prior to acceptance, and do not release to the field or the integration center
        images that have not been tested.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If using CD or other portable medium, test some percentage of the image copies prior to deployment.&nbsp; A random
        selection of 10-15% of the copies would most likely expose any duplication errors.&nbsp; If any of the copies fail,
        a larger percentage should be tested, up to 100%.&nbsp; Reduplication may be necessary should significant errors be
        exposed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If using CD or other portable medium, request multiple copies of the image.&nbsp; You will need replacements for
        the integration center, as images will get damaged during use.&nbsp; You will need copies for the deployment team
        in case re-imaging is required at the site.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If using CD or other portable medium, maintain two images at the project office.&nbsp; One image should be kept as
        an archive copy and only used for verification purposes.&nbsp; The second copy should only be used as an emergency
        master to make copies from.&nbsp; Neither of these images should be released to the field nor handled
        extensively.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Issues to be aware of that may impact the usability of the Customized Software Image:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customer proprietary software (and incomplete information on same).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Other rollouts occurring during your project that may impact the correctness of the image (e.g. Token Ring to
        Ethernet architecture).
    </li>
    <li>
        Removal of machine or user specific identification, created on the equipment during application loading, which
        should not be copied during image creation.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The correct level of user rights for the deployed equipment (often administrative rights are established in order
        to load applications prior to image creation but lesser rights are intended for the user).
    </li>
    <li>
        Consideration of the chosen image medium and the ability to use that medium at an Integration Center or on the
        client site during deployment (e.g. CD images deployed where no CD drives are installed, images delivered over a
        server where intranet traffic is already at a critical level).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Images for all of the affected rollout equipment and all of the equipment configurations.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Any other relevant issues, settings, or policies that are to be deployed via the image.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Project Manager may also wish to be certain,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        That the appropriate number of software licenses have been obtained for the rollout equipment.
    </li>
    <li>
        That the correct user rights are established on the image.
    </li>

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Impact of not having</th><td class="sectionTableCell">If a custom software image is not used, the operating system, each custom application, and all client settings will need to

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    If the client configuration has only minor differences from the standard image that is being used at the factory a
    custom image may not be required. It should be determined how long a manual configuration based on the factory image
    will take as compared to a custom image load.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
    If the client has numerous models or configurations of equipment to be deployed, creating a custom image for each
    machine may be cost prohibitive. It should be determined how much manual configurations will cost, as compared to
    creating and testing multiple custom images and then using those images to configure the
    equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
    If existing client equipment is to be imaged and re-deployed, and information about that equipment is insufficient or
    untrustworthy, creating and using a custom software image is not suggested.
