    This artifact&nbsp;is used for many purposes:
</p>
<p>
    In most clients, the current portfolio of systems will usually comprise a mixture of centralized and distributed,
    custom and packaged, IS and end-user developed systems - they therefore often have a complex mix of applications
    (covering similar functions for different areas of the business), databases and infrastructure. In this type of
    environment, the assessment is used to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify gaps between the desired distinctive business and IT capabilities and the support currently available.
    </li>
    <li>
        Highlight the age and technical efficiency of the existing applications, databases and infrastructure and their
        longer term technical potential
    </li>
    <li>
        Help identify major areas of potential overlap and confusion
    </li>
    <li>
        Position a client within a peer group of industry and IT departments - enables understanding of the wider business
        and IT environment within which they operate
    </li>
    <li>
        Highlight potential areas of change (in the short, medium and long-term) and direction that will enable more
        effective business decisions to be made
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify weaknesses in the current portfolio
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a basis for identifying short-term tactical projects to achieve rapid business benefits
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The assessment is also used as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A major input to the identification and scoping of candidate application and infrastructure-related initiatives and
        to the costs of proposed solutions and therefore their business case and viability
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    While the outputs from these assessments are key 'deliverables' in their own right, they are also key inputs to many
    follow-on activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Subsequent EA model definition
    </li>
    <li>
        Definition of transition projects and initiatives, that are in turn input to a transition strategy and plan to
        implement the recommendations
    </li>
    <li>
        More detailed IT Management, Security and Networking projects
    </li>
</ul></td>

    This artifact&nbsp;can take many forms: an assessment of the functional and technical quality of a client's installed
    applications, databases and/or infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to the applications, the assessment is focused on two complimentary views of functional and technical
    quality (FQ / TQ as it is sometimes called). The former is concerned with both the extent to which the applications
    support the critical business functions and the quality of that support. The latter is concerned with their technical
    efficiency, (e.g. their age, stability, accessibility, reliability, maintainability) and the longer term technical
    potential.
</p>
<p>
    For database assessment, this work product is focused on data quality, (i.e. currency, redundancy, accuracy) and the
    potential to support the future business strategies.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to the current infrastructure, the assessment is focused on technical efficiency, e.g. stability,
    reliability, maintainability, age of installed base, support for critical business functions e.g. availability,
    performance, accessibility, anticipated business growth and the longer term technical potential.
</p>
<p>
    The scope of this type of assessment is usually limited to a subset of the application / database portfolio that is
    judged to be the most important in terms of their support for the current business operations and their future
    potential.
</p>
<p>
    Any specific problems and opportunities associated with these applications, databases and infrastructure are captured
    and documented as input to subsequent activities and work products
</p>
<p>
    An assessment of the efficiency, cost structure or competencies of the IS/IT organization and its management. This
    often takes the form of general industry and peer group comparisons, using Industry standard models, IBM IT Comparison
    Intellectual Capital and other external sources of material e.g. Gartner Group. Comparisons can be done in a number of
    different areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        IT as a % of overall expenses, IT as a % of revenue
    </li>
    <li>
        Data Centre computing - utilized MIPS (or equivalent)
    </li>
    <li>
        Departmental and personal computing - numbers of users
    </li>
    <li>
        Information capture and presentation - as a % of total IT costs
    </li>
    <li>
        Data Network - numbers of end-user stations supported
    </li>
    <li>
        Voice Network - numbers of end-user connections supported
    </li>
    <li>
        Application development and maintenance - as a % of total IT costs
    </li>
    <li>
        Help Desk - total calls per year handled
    </li>
    <li>
        Current IT department staffing and skills
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    An assessment of the IS/IT organizationâ€™s capabilities, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The efficiency and effectiveness of current processes, policies, practices and management culture
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether the organization is structured and aligned effectively to support the business - including the required
        linkages between departments
    </li>
    <li>
        Skills, resourcing policies
    </li>
    <li>
        Effectiveness of planning and implementation roll-out
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Assessments of this type can be conducted in several types of engagements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        As part of a strategy level engagement - when it is normally the only assessment of IT that is undertaken
    </li>
    <li>
        During the early stages of an Enterprise Architecture level engagement, to gain an insight into the overall age,
        usage and gaps in the applications, data and infrastructure as an input to defining the requirements that are
        captured in the EA model
    </li>
    <li>
        During a detailed IT Infrastructure Management or Networking engagement
    </li>
    <li>
        As part of an As-Is versus To-Be comparison to support migration from legacy to new systems. This migration often
        occurs to take advantage of new technology and to support a new user group including people who require special
        accessibility enablers.

    Define a common information gathering plan to ensure you use your time effectively. You should co-ordinate interviews,
    workshops and surveys/questionnaires to cover the entire scope of the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    When it comes to the assessment of the current application portfolio, there are various approaches that can be
    used:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Some more sophisticated approaches to current portfolio analysis categorize the applications according to their
        importance and contribution to the business, These ideas, developed by McFarlan (1984) and extended by Ward and
        Griffiths (1996), make use of a 2x2 matrix to classify each application. The value of this approach lies in its
        simplicity (it is easy to get client staff to classify the applications into one of 4 categories) and the fact that
        it provides a high-level picture of the complete current portfolio that can be agreed by the different groups of
        stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        Combine the application and database questions. In older legacy environments that were developed without any view
        on sharing data through corporate databases - the two will be inextricably linked.
    </li>

    Without an assessment of the technical environment, it would not be possible to take optimal decisions regarding the
    replacement, or enhancement of existing systems, in order to support the required business and IT capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    The extent and quality of support provided by the current applications and their associated databases and
    infrastructure, are important factors in deciding where future transition efforts and resources should be targeted for
    maximum benefit.
