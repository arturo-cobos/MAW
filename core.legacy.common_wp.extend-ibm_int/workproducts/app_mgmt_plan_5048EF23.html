            provided by other organizations must be formally verified by the related organization before submission to the

ambiguous and high-level descriptions, will be the main reference for delivery of the services. This situation can result
in ad hoc, ineffective, and uncoordinated activities with different interpretations of the committed services where risk
for customer dissatisfaction and cost overrun would be very high.</td>
