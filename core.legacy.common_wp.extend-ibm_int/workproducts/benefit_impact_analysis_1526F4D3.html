    The Benefit Impact Analysis work product includes the following information:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Success Indicators</strong> – The business problem and critical needs of the business are analyzed and captured
    as goal statements based on perceived gaps between the current and desired state of business and individual performance
    (e.g., increase sales by 40%, reduce customer call time by 2 minutes).&nbsp; The resulting “success indicators” are
    analyzed and categorized into five strategic perspectives.&nbsp; They define the overall success criteria of the
    solution and help ensure that the criteria are met.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Business Performance –</strong> This is the high-level view of the needs and issues of the business that
        contribute to the business need for new solutions.&nbsp; Business performance is typically measured by executives
        and department heads in terms of overall operational costs and/or revenue to the organization.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Job/Task Performance –</strong> Job/Task Performance needs and success indicators must be further broken
        down into measurable success indicators derived from the Business Performance success indicators.&nbsp; For
        example, to reduce turnover rate, it is necessary to uncover the underlying causes for high turnover rate among the
        employees/end users affected.&nbsp; High turnover rates may have a number of related causes, such as poor job
        preparation resulting in less than adequate productivity and low job satisfaction among some employees.&nbsp;
        Job/Task Performance success indicators can be uncovered by observing and interviewing representative managers and
        end users.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Training and User Support –</strong> Many Business Performance and Job/Task Performance success indicators
        point directly to training and on-the-job user support needs (e.g., reduce training time and costs, increase number
        of outputs produced).&nbsp; This process involves conducting initial job/task analyses with representative experts
        and end users to define job roles and prioritize the tasks and requisite skills that fulfill job
        requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining the Training and User Support success indicators involves an examination of the
        effectiveness of current training (e.g., classroom, computer-based training) and on-the-job support strategies
        (e.g., on-line help, on-the-job mentoring) as they relate to many of the identified Business Performance and
        Job/Task Performance success indicators.&nbsp; Success factors, such as increase productivity, decrease errors,
        increase job satisfaction, or reduce training time and costs, all point to critical Training and User Support
        success indicators.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Usability –</strong> Usability success indicators are often identified as goals, or requirements, for the
        user interface design and job/task performance using the application.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Technology and Implementation –</strong> Although Technology and Implementation success indicators begin to
        define critical parameters about the solution, such as the delivery platform(s) and system performance, it is
        important to not focus on specific technical functional requirements too prematurely.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Benchmark Matrix</strong> – Using the list of success indicators as a guide, relevant quantifiable current and
    targeted measures of doing business that must be addressed by the solution are identified as benchmark measures in a
    matrix.&nbsp; The targeted measures can be projected over predetermined intervals, such as 6 months, 12 months, and 2
    years.&nbsp; Follow-up measures are included in the benchmark matrix for calculating the actual impact of the solution
    after implementation and roll out.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>People&nbsp;Measures</strong>&nbsp;- The people in the business are one of the greatest, and often
        costliest, assets, and it is their job/task performance that is often the focus of the solution.&nbsp; The relevant
        personnel or user groups to be impacted by the solution are identified, and their costs to the business are
        quantified.&nbsp; These costs are typically characterized in terms of compensation, including: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Annual salary + benefits (often broken down into an average hourly rate)
            </li>
            <li>
                Bonus incentives
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Compensation is used to quantify several people-related issues that impose costs to the business, such as: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Training and/or retraining (e.g., may include trainee/employee compensation plus travel and costs for
                replacement help on their job)
            </li>
            <li>
                On-the-job mentoring (e.g., may include costs for “time off task” for supervisors or other job experts who
                are frequently tapped, or interrupted, for job-related support for novice employees)
            </li>
            <li>
                Absenteeism (e.g., average number of days absent, cost of additional help)
            </li>
            <li>
                Turnover (e.g., usually expressed as a percentage rate and/or associated training and support costs for new
                hires)
            </li>
            <li>
                Grievances and/or conflicts (e.g., expressed as average or total number of employee grievances to be
                reduced by a specified percentage)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Productivity Measures -&nbsp;</strong>Productivity measures are key to addressing both the business
        performance and user job/task performance strategic perspectives.&nbsp; Productivity is typically measured as
        outputs or errors and can be quantified in terms of number, time, or quality. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Outputs: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Number (e.g., number of “widgets” produced, number of closed sales, number of orders processed)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time (e.g., time to produce one “widget,” sales cycle time from first contact to close)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quality (e.g., rated on a scale from 1 – low to 10 – high; the quality rating of a customer service
                        representative’s interaction with a customer; the quality rating of the product produced)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Costs related to outputs may include not only the salary and benefits of employees, but bonus incentives
                for number, time, or quality of outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Errors: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Number (e.g., number of customer complaints, number of rule/procedure violations, number of
                        accidents or outages)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time (e.g., time required to “fix” an error, nonproductive downtime)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quality (e.g., serious/high impact errors vs. minor/low impact errors)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                It is often difficult to determine the actual dollar cost of an error (e.g., the cost of an accident in
                which lives were lost).&nbsp; For many forms of “errors,” however, the cost can be based on the salary plus
                benefits for the person hours involved in “fixing” an error, for example.
            </li>
            <li>
                Environment Measures.&nbsp; The environment measures addressed by the solution often involve technology and
                implementation-related factors, such as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Process for software, database, or online documentation maintenance and updating
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Publication and distribution costs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Timeliness of job-related updates
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        System response time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compatibility across delivery environments, workstation operating systems, and/or with other
                        software applications
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Support for employee communications and teamwork
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Benefit Analysis</strong> – During the Benefit Impact Analysis process, five strategic perspectives are used to
    analyze and define the success indicators for the solution.&nbsp; The strategic perspectives reflect the views of the
    solution from different stakeholders, such as executive, operations, finance, information systems, human resource
    development, and training and technical support.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Targeted Benefits.</strong>&nbsp; For the success indicators and the benchmark measures identified,
        relevant “benefits” are defined in measures and terms that are meaningful to the client.&nbsp; The benefits
        measures typically represent a change from the current to the targeted measures identified in the benchmark
        matrix.&nbsp; If predefined target intervals are included, the benefits measures would be stated as the change from
        the current to targeted measure 1 and the change from the current to targeted measure 2 (targeted benefit for Year
        1 and Year 2).&nbsp; Benefits measures are expressed as any of the following changes: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Dollar value (e.g., increase sales by $80,000 in 6 months and by $200,000 in 12 months as compared to the
                original sales figure).
            </li>
            <li>
                Percent (e.g., decrease errors by 20% in Year 1 and by 50% in Year 2).
            </li>
            <li>
                Rate (e.g., increase customer satisfaction ratings from the current average of 4 – Acceptable, but not
                great to 9 – Excellent service on a scale of 1 – Unsatisfactory to 10 – Exceeded expectations, in the first
                year).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Solution Cost.</strong>&nbsp; A key factor in calculating the ROI for a solution is the actual cost of the
        solution.&nbsp; The solution cost must include the full range of components in the software application design,
        development, testing, and implementation, including performance support system, training, hardware/network support,
        and documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Return on Investment (ROI).</strong>&nbsp; Basically, ROI is the total dollar amount of the benefits
        compared to the total cost of the solution.&nbsp; ROI can be expressed in three ways: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                $Total ROI Sum = $Total Solution Benefits Value – (minus) $Total Solution Cost
            </li>
            <li>
                ROI Ratio = Total Solution Benefits Value: Total Solution Cost (e.g., 2:1)
            </li>
            <li>
                ROI % = Total Solution Benefits Value&nbsp; x 100 – Total Solution Cost&nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    The following list includes some indications when Benefit Impact Analysis is appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Employee performance is below what is expected/acceptable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Job performance will be more closely tied to pay incentives and promotions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Content/procedures are rapidly and/or continuously changing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Job experts become novices transitioning from legacy to new workflow system.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a high turnover rate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Job functions need to be standardized and performance tracked.
    </li>
    <li>
        Employees are not prepared for the current job (changing job requirements).
    </li>
    <li>
        Training time is too long.
    </li>
    <li>
        Costs for current training are too high.
    </li>
    <li>
        Employees are dissatisfied with current job-related tools and on-the-job support.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Two reports on the cost-benefit/ROI of Intranet deployments illustrate how critical a cost-benefit analysis is to
    defining the success of the solution.&nbsp; In a vendor-independent review of the costs and benefits of Intranet
    deployments across 55 businesses/ organizations ranging in size from $2 million to $35 billion, a significant
    correlation was found between Intranet ROI and type of application (META Group Consulting Report, 1997).&nbsp;
    Organizations implementing publishing-only applications had significantly lower returns than those that provided
    dynamic and interactive capabilities, especially database access.&nbsp; Benefits were generally achieved as a result of
    one or more of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Headcount reductions
    </li>
    <li>
        More rapid time-to-market for either new or existing products
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduced information printing, access, distribution, or management costs
    </li>
    <li>
        Increased productivity
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved customer or employee retention
    </li>
    <li>
        Increased employee collaboration/communication
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    IDC’s ROI case studies of five companies implementing Netscape Intranet solutions found ROI results ranging from 205%
    to 2,063% (with the average well over 1000%).&nbsp; With payback periods ranging from <u>6 to 12 weeks</u>, this study
    found the Intranet technology and solutions development investment to be unusually low as compared to other technology
    investments.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;a leading supplier of electronic design automation software tools and professional
    services, focused its Intranet solution on supporting the work of sales representatives worldwide.&nbsp; Sales
    representatives must have an in-depth understanding of the almost 1,000 products and services as well as the customer’s
    competitive business environment in order to provide effective consulting services.&nbsp; The resulting Web-based
    solution maps each phase of the sales process (e.g., Identify Business Issues) with supporting materials and reference
    information using a home page with links to other pages, information sources, and custom applications.&nbsp; The bottom
    line results for this company’s solution is:

<ul>
    <li>
        Total 3-year costs: $1,423,133
    </li>
    <li>
        Total 3-year savings: $7,609,882
    </li>
    <li>
        Payback period: 0.15 years
    </li>
    <li>
        ROI (over 3 years): 1,766%
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The greatest impact on the benefits recognized in this significant ROI was due to the shortened learning time for new
    sales reps.&nbsp; Reductions in the time for a new sales rep to become fully proficient ranged from 2 to 4
    months.&nbsp; One new sales rep said that he “learned in 2 days from&nbsp;the new company&nbsp;what it took months to
    learn at a previous company.”&nbsp; (IDC Report, 1997)

        There are often other contributing factors to substandard job/task performance, such as inadequate pay and poor
        working conditions that cannot be remedied by any technical solution, no matter how exceptional it is.&nbsp; It is
        important to identify and capture these other contributing factors that will need to be addressed with other
        solutions (e.g., business process solutions) in order to meet the organization’s needs and goals for success.
    </li>
    <li>
        Usability success indicators are best satisfied through a rigorous, iterative user interface design and usability
        testing process built into the project life cycle from beginning to end.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is not always appropriate or accurate to report the ROI in a Benefit Impact Analysis since the ROI is derived
        from dollar value costs and benefits.&nbsp; If the critical benefits are expressed as percentage (%) increase in
        productivity rather than dollar value or improved customer satisfaction ratings from “3” to “9,” for example, then
        the ROI calculation may not be appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
        When calculating ROI is appropriate, be sure to work with financial staff to include all relevant values in the
        calculations (e.g., “discounted dollars,” “net present value.”)
    </li>
</ul>It is critical that any financial “costs” and “benefits” are reviewed and validated by appropriate financial
personnel.</td>
