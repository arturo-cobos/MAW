    The main purpose of a <b>Solution Areas</b> Work Product is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Document a recommended and prioritized set of project initiatives based on a customer’s declared capability model.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify and confirm how each initiative supports the set of capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify and confirm that each initiative as scoped represents a well-defined project initiative with clear
        performance indicators.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the major objective of each initiative and its implied subject area data dependency as well as
        organizational alignment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Communicate to the customer the industry-specific as well as customer-specific benefits and risks associated with
        each project initiative.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop a document around a set of development initiatives that represents the consensus built by customer
        stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide input into a detailed release plan and project estimates for the highest priority and recommended project
        initiative.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This work product also represents a hand-off point between various IBM competency groups. For example, it is hoped and
    anticipated that an Industry Solution Unit (ISU) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) practice might work with a
    customer to develop their core value propositions, capability models, and capability enablers. At some point, however,
    in the identification of capability enablers, there may be a realization that one or more of the enablers suggests a
    Business Intelligence (BI) (or Electronic Document Management (EDM) or E-business) solution. If the Solution Areas work
    product is within the scope of the consulting engagement, it is appropriate to engage a qualified competency SME (i.e.
    BI practitioner, or EDM or E-business SME) to join the team. If not, the Solution Areas work product represents the
    starting point for a consulting engagement in which a BI (or EDM or E-business) competent practitioner would document
    the project focus areas specific to enabling the BI (or EDM or E-business) value proposition.

    The techniques used to gather the necessary information to prioritize solution areas are dependent on a high degree of
    interaction, participation and involvement by the business stakeholders of the capability. A critical by-product of
    this work product is the client consensus built around the final, prioritized list of solution areas.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Solution Areas</b> work product develops the customer’s capability model and capability enablers into a list of
    possible development projects. Each of the potential solution areas will, by definition, support the customer’s value
    propositions developed in the capability model. For each proposed development project, the <b>Solution Areas</b> work
    product documents the affected organizational units in the customer’s current organizational structure, the key subject
    area data within scope, and the customer’s primary performance indicators used to measure success. In addition,
    industry-specific, tangible and intangible business benefits and risks as well as customer-specific benefits and risks
    are used to prioritize the solution areas. A high-level development approach is outlined for the highest priority
    solution area.
</p>
<p>
    This work product is generally applicable in response to a customer’s query, "How do I get started enabling this
    capability (i.e. Customer Relationship Management, Business Intelligence, e-business)?" It is critical to those
    consulting engagements in which the outcome is a list of possible projects. This work product is not required when
    decisions and budgetary commitments have already been made to undertake a particular project such as the replacement of
    a payroll system.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The development of the Solution Areas work product depends greatly on two key skills, 1) Industry/functional subject
    matter expertise and 2) facilitation experience. For example, a customer whose primary product is women’s apparel,
    whose main distribution method is through catalog sales, and whose business intelligence interest is centered around
    controlling costs and increasing the average purchase quantity and total dollar amount per order would need an industry
    subject matter expert on the project team who is familiar with the main drivers of cost control and customer buying
    habits in this environment. Facilitation skills are important because it is a primary technique used to engage the
    customer in articulating their information needs and the decisions the desired information needs to support.
</p>
<p>
    A significant and essential by-product of the development of this work product is the consensus built around the
    results.By inviting input from all stakeholders with an interest in the enablement of a defined capability, and by
    leading them all through a structured and impartial process for the rational prioritization of identified solution
    areas, the consultant achieves the ‘buy-in’ based on a business case analysis that justifies the subsequent expenditure
    of funds, resources and time that each solution area represents.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the level of detail available as input into the activities to develop this work product, the project team
    may have to iterate several times through steps 3 and 4 of the development approach outlined above.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Because the results of this work product are a set of possible development areas, no one solution area will have been
    developed to sufficiently detail that a subsequent analysis and design effort is not needed.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Verify that the client understands the purpose of the Solution Areas work product – what it represents, how it was
        developed and its importance in guiding the subsequent development work.
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate, as early in the development cycle of the work product as possible, the scope of this work product,
        especially as it relates to the identified stakeholder groups whose input will form the basis of the results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate that clent stakeholder groups and client executive management agree to the results documented in&nbsp;the
        work product and can articulate the value of the process used to develop the results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify that the Solution Areas work product is perceived as a 'living' document to be referred to at major review
        points or after major organizational changes for the continued validity of its results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify that the client understands what a Solution Areas work product is and the risk inherent in not developing
        this work product.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify that the client understands the key skills required to develop this work product in the event that they wish
        to assume ownership of its maintenance in the future
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify the client understand the implications of each Solution Area outlined in the work product and that client is
        in fact committed to proceeding with the various steps and activities to attain the strategic objective.

    This work product is at the heart of projects in which a customer wants to turn their declared set of capabilities into
    actionable project initiatives. It is critical to those consulting engagements in which the outcome is a list of
    possible projects. This work product is not required when decisions and budgetary commitments have already been made to
    undertake a particular project. Should this work product not be prepared, then any combination of the following may
    occur:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The customer will not understand or remember how current project initiatives are linked to their stated value
        propositions or capability models. Project initiatives, which are developed, may ‘solve the wrong problem’
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer embarks on project initiatives without benefit of a rigorous business case analysis
    </li>
    <li>
        Members of the customer community whose capabilities are addressed in lower priority initiatives may not understand
        and support the priority ranking and choose to initiate actions which ultimately jeopardize the subsequent
        completion of any of the projects
    </li>
    <li>
        The project team begins an Analysis and Design effort in which the scope and vision of the project have not been
        established. This situation jeopardizes both requirements definition as well as project estimation activities

    Under certain project circumstances, this work product may not be needed, or it may need to be prepared in an

</p>
<p>
    A <b>Solution Areas</b> work product may not be needed in circumstances where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The client organization or another vendor or IBM consulting organization has formulated this information and can

    </li>
    <li>
        Client management has mandated that a particular solution area is addressed, the scope of this solution area is
        documented and is sufficiently bounded that the project team agrees that release plans and project estimates can be
        developed
