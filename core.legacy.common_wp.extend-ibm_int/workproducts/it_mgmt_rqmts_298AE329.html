    This work product is used for evaluating the existing client IT management environment and determining what changes to
    that environment are required to support the IT management services in the scope of the engagement. It encompasses the
    gathering of the detailed IT management requirements for process, tools, organization, and data.
</p>
<p>
    This work product is used to identify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        what modifications will need to be made to existing processes and what new processes will need to be implemented.
    </li>
    <li>
        what already-installed tools are sufficient and what new tools should be acquired. (By arranging the tool
        requirements in generic tool definitions, the tool requirements can be more easily compared against the
        functionality of tools already in use by the client. In addition the tool requirements will become the functional
        requirements for selection of new tools).

</ul>
<p>
    IT Management Requirements are composed of four sections:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>IT management process requirements</b>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>IT management tool requirements</b>

    <li>
        <div>
            <b>IT management organization requirements</b>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><u>IT management process requirements</u></b> are requirements on the sub-processes involved in delivering the in
    scope IT services. These may take the form of requirements for modification of existing processes, or depending on the
    state of the IT management environment, requirements for new processes.
</p>
<p>
    IT management processes and sub-processes are used as the basis, in conjunction with the specific IT elements, for
    organizing tools, skills and data requirements gathering exercises.
</p>
<p>
    The IT management process requirements should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            An overview of the existing <b>processes</b> involved
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A list of <b>requirements</b> for each process
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A list of <b>new processes</b> that will be required
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The <b><u>IT management tool requirements</u></b> define the generic tool profiles for tools needed to perform the
    sub-processes involved in delivering a desired service.
</p>
<p>
    Generic tools can be defined as: “any technology that will be used in the management of the target system.” Defined
    generically, the tools become descriptions of types of tools available for systems management and should not be
    associated with actual products until they are fully defined. The generic tool should represent the "to-be" tool,
    instead of merely a description of an existing product. In this way, generic tools that are defined by requirements
    that cannot be met by any existing product can sometimes be realized through development or acquisition of several
    tools that, when combined, satisfy the generic tool requirements. Tool requirements consist of functional,
    non-functional as well as interface requirements to enable performance of the systems management sub-processes.
</p>
<p>
    The IT management tool requirements should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            An overview of <b>technology elements</b> involved
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A list of <b>functional requirements</b> for each tool
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A list of <b>generic tools</b> that will be required
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Optionally, it may also contain:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Where the tool will reside
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A cross-reference of the tool to the sub-processes and/or capabilities using the tool
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The <b><u>IT management data requirements</u></b> define data elements that are necessary to support the performance of
    the sub-processes.<br />
    Process teams and subject matter experts develop the data requirements.<br />
    The IT management data requirements should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            An overview of sub-processes and IT-elements involved
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A list of data requirements for each sub-process
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The <b><u>IT management organization requirements</u></b> define the generic skill profiles for roles needed to perform
    the sub-processes involved in delivering a desired IT management service.
</p>
<p>
    Generic roles are defined by the set of skills required and the set of systems management sub-processes performed, the
    generic role is a "hat" worn by an IS resource. The term "<b>generic</b>" is used during the design to prevent tying a
    role to an actual job existing in the client organization before the role can be defined.

<div class="sectionContent">
<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Experience has shown that all discussions concerning "tools" in one way or another tend to be very subjective and
    sometimes even emotional. It is advisable to define tool requirements and generic tools first. This will provide the
    foundation for the evaluation of the current tool environment, the identification of gaps and the tool selection in
    later phases of the engagement.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Note: <i>The term "tool" in this work product denotes any technology that will be used in the management of the target
    system. Most tools are applications specifically designed for systems management; however tools may also be a built-in
    feature of the target system (e.g., Telnet for remote access, native SNMP agents).</i><br />
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, discussions concerning "roles" often can become political. It is crucial to define skill requirements and
    generic roles first. This will provide the foundation for mapping the generic roles against the current organization to
    identify gaps.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The collection of data requirements is considered a critical success factor for downstream engagement activities.
    Nevertheless, it is not advisable to put too much effort into the details. It is sufficient only to collect data
    groupings e.g. "Employee Information" instead of "surname, first name, telephone #, personal identifier, date of
    birth". During the implementation these data categories will then be detailed and again reviewed with the client.<br />
</p>
<p>
    In order to successfully complete this task it is necessary to,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Structure the work. Thought should be given to the type of expertise required to cover specific sub-processes
            or managed IT elements.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Quickly review each sub-process prior to capturing the requirements to remind team members of the definition,
            scope and objectives of the sub-process in question.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Use the templates as starting points to promote discussion. Capture the requirements that are independent of
            the elements for each sub-process. The process teams should attempt to <b>prioritize the requirements</b> as
            they are collected (i.e. High, Medium, or Low Priority). This will be of great help to the design team in
            attempting to satisfy specific requirements on tool mapping and selection.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Divide the work and assign responsibility to process team members. Subject Matter Experts (SME) are useful here
            to ensure the capture of specific detailed technical requirements that might be otherwise overlooked by the
            teams due to lack of detailed technical. Client process team members typically show reluctance to complete the
            work in this way; however, due to the amount of data that must be captured, it should be stressed that this
            approach will be required in order to stay on schedule.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Begin with a quality set of template requirements.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Maintain the process team focus.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Ensure that requirements are collected with as much detail as possible.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Document requirements as they are collected.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Ensure that process teams include in their work only those requirements from templates that are applicable and
            make sense.

        Without well defined process requirements, the tool, data and organization requirements that are developed based on
        the sub-processes may be incompletely and/or incorrectly defined

    <li>
        Without well-defined tool requirements the client may not realize that some already installed tools may fit the

        Without well-defined data requirements the client may not realize that the solution design developed may not

        Poor data requirements definition can lead to insufficient data availability later on during the implementation of
        a project.
