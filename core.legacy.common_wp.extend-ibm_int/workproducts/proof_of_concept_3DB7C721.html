    This work product is produced to prove and validate the process design through various simulation techniques. The
    simulation activity looks to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide a facility for the redesign and integration of the business process in an iterative manner while validating
        the expected results. It enables users, developers, and managers to reach design decisions quickly
    </li>
    <li>
        Assess the appropriateness of enabling technologies and software solutions to the process design. It provides a
        better understanding of the package solutions capabilities against the desired business requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify and evaluate the impacts of the process design to the organization (i.e. roles, resources, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Minimize the overall risk to the project through the validation of the process design prior to engaging in the
        implementation activities of the solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify additional requirements to fill package deficiencies
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate hypothesized performance levels and results (i.e. volumes, cycle time, performance metrics, etc.).
        Determine acceptable limits and results
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate the business benefit measurements and technology costs in the business case (i.e. estimated solution
        costs, expected process benefits, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide better information for planning the development and deployment efforts
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the issues, results, and findings of the simulation order to set and evaluate future performance levels
    </li>
    <li>
        Achieve customer acceptance and buy-in

    Simple simulations, such as a paper-based walk-through of a process design, will often suffice.&nbsp; Computer
    simulations are usually justified when the process is complex, with many events and variations coming into play
    defining the specific "Proof of Concept" needs for the project, consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What needs exist for visualization of the new business system e.g., to build organizational buy-in or support
        validation efforts?
    </li>
    <li>
        How might computer simulation help validate the proposed technology approach? Resolve performance uncertainties?
    </li>
    <li>
        The value versus the cost/time investment required of creating a scale model prototype of the new business system
        to enable demonstration, study or testing
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Whichever method is used to prove the concept, there is likely to be feedback on potential improvements to the
    process.&nbsp;These should be incorporated and if necessary the Proof of Concept has to be run again.
</p>
<p>
    In rare cases, it may happen that the stakeholders are not satisfied with the future process concept (i.e. the concept
    is not proven).&nbsp; If this happens, it may be necessary to go 'back to the drawing board' with the process.&nbsp;
    This may require revisiting the business objectives, the process design principles and objectives, the selected process
    enablers and the design of the business system (process, organization and technology).
</p>
<p>
    Advice and guidance can be found in the simulation game reference guide.
</p>
<p>
    It makes sense to involve stakeholders and to ask them to devise potential disruptions to the normal process that can
    be evaluated in the simulation.<br />
