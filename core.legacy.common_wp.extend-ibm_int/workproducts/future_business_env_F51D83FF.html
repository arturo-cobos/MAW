<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The purpose of the Future Business Environment is to describe an organization’s future environment (or future environments
depending on the relevant level of uncertainty) at a level of detail adequate to conduct opportunity identification and/or
strategy formulation. In order to define this future environment, a company must determine the amount of uncertainty that
it is facing in addressing its strategic issues or questions. Then, based on this level of uncertainty, the future
environment is described in detail using a PARTS framework. For reasonably certain futures, there may be only one future
environment description. As uncertainty about the future increases, the number of environment descriptions increases (but
should not exceed four or five - reasons for which are provided as a part of the Scenario Planning technique).</td>

    The <b>Future Business Environment</b> work product:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identifies the critical trends and relevant environmental forces (both micro and macro) that are shaping the issues
        facing the organization and influencing the outcome of the organization’s strategic decisions
    </li>
    <li>
        Determines the approximate level of uncertainty in the future business environment based on each force’s range of
        possible outcomes and its level of impact on any of the organization’s key decision factors
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides a framework for understanding what the future environment (or potential future environments) will look
        like so that the organization can make optimal strategic decisions
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The development of any future business environment is heavily dependent upon thorough definition of the focal area and
    completion of the current state Value Net including a PARTS analysis. Failure to define the focal area in detail
    increases the likelihood that the scope of included environmental factors will be too broad. This increased breadth of
    scope introduces a number of risks. First, the level of uncertainty could be significantly overestimated resulting in
    the adoption of a future environment development approach that is more complicated and requires more resources than
    would otherwise be necessary. Second, strategic decision making will be factoring in irrelevant issues and
    environmental forces potentially resulting in sub-optimal resource investments and unnecessary responses to changes in
    the business environment.
</p>
<p>
    While completion of a current state Value Net and PARTS analysis is neither a stated nor an absolute requirement for
    future business environment development, the benefits of conducting these activities extend far beyond the artificial
    boundaries defined by this work product. Value Nets and their associated PARTS analysis play a key role in IBM’s
    strategy methodologies and are used as a competitive differentiator in the marketplace. Leveraging them in the future
    environment analysis (as well as in other downstream activities) recognizes their importance in executing engagements,
    links the various components of the methodology, provides a consistent framework for analysis and creates a vehicle for
    communication both internally within the project team and externally with the client.
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of approaches that can be used to help organizations understand the future business environments (or
    potential future environments). These will be discussed in greater detail in section five of this document. At this
    point of the discussion it is only important to know that multiple approaches exist and, more importantly, why they
    exist.
</p>
<p>
    A Future Environment Analysis is conducted to address one overarching issue within the strategy space: uncertainty. If
    the future were a given, then very little effort would be needed in order to prepare for it.

<p>
    Companies would have relatively simple strategic decisions and resource deployment options. Unfortunately (or
    fortunately depending on the perspective taken), this is not the case. As we all are very much aware, every company
    faces uncertainty when it attempts to understand issues or answer questions about the future. The question is: "What
    approach and how much effort should companies apply in attempting to comprehend what the future holds?" The answer,
    quite simply, is, "It depends."
</p>
<p>
    The level or degree of uncertainty that an organization faces when attempting to address issues or answer questions
    about the future is determined by two key factors. One factor is the scope of the organization issue or question. A
    company attempting to answer the question, "Should I expand my current product line to include larger sizes?" will be
    impacted by far fewer environmental forces than a company attempting to answer the question, "Should I develop
    production capacity in China?" As the scope of an issue or question increases, so, too, does the range of potential
    future outcomes.
</p>
<p>
    The other key factor to consider is the time frame within which the issue or question is relevant. Changes in the
    future business environment are inevitable. The longer the period of time over which a question or issue is relevant,
    the greater the chance that the business environment will change and that the change will be significant.
</p>
<p>
    When helping clients understand their future business environment (or potential future business environments),
    uncertainty is broadly classified into four broad categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>A Clear-Enough Future</b> - a single forecast precise enough for determining strategy
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Alternative Futures</b> - a few discrete outcomes that define the future
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>A Range of Futures</b> - a range of possible outcomes, but no natural scenarios
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>True Ambiguity</b> - no basis to forecast the future
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each of the above categories of uncertainty, the Future Business Environment Work Product Description will provide
    examples of the environment, outline the recommended approach for defining the future environment and describe the work
    product outputs.

    any other relevant information, into a tabular format so that the relative importance can be more easily determined.

        Assisting clients in understanding their future environment and making subjective decisions related to these
        potential futures puts IBM at significant risk.&nbsp; Development of this work product should only be undertaken
        with the involvement of consultants who are both trained and experienced in this area.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rely on senior industry, functional and technical specialists for information on environmental forces.&nbsp;
        Because of the executive interaction, it requires this experience for credibility.&nbsp; Often they will not be
        basing their findings on detailed analysis, but on judgement and experience applied to sparse information obtained
        from research, a small number of executive interviews and/or workshops.&nbsp; The use of internal specialists at
        this stage will help build their support and commitment to the final product.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is particularly important to gain confidence of management at this early stage in a strategy engagement, and to
        seek their views on how best to proceed, offering some alternatives.&nbsp; The final strategy will be theirs to
        implement, and, as such, their involvement and commitment to the process and the outcome is essential.&nbsp;
        Special care must be given with individuals who feel threatened in any way by the engagement, particularly business
        unit managers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be prepared to deal with complex organization structures.&nbsp; For example, if a global company, it may be
        necessary to understand corporate objectives and identify similarities and differences across subsidiaries.&nbsp;
        The future may look different based on which business units are impacted by the project (Focal Area).
    </li>
    <li>
        Strategic analysis of industry sector and competitive factors is essential for drawing pertinent business based
        conclusions from internally and externally sourced information and experience.
