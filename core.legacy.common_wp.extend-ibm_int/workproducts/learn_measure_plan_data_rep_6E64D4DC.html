<p>
    <b>Predictive Measurement</b>
</p>
<p>
    Its purpose is to explore the linkage between potential interventions and desired business results, identify measures,
    and inform intervention requirements. Predictive measurement provides valuable data before investment decisions are
    made -- to increase the value of the learning portfolio and learning interventions -- before a lot of money is spent.
    It is based primarily on <i>qualitative data</i> and <i>estimated quantitative data</i>. Its primary purpose is to
    increase understanding of the relationship between proposed interventions and business results. Predictive measurement
    is also valuable for identifying business results-oriented learning measures and business requirements for proposed
    interventions.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Baseline Measurement</b>
</p>
<p>
    Baseline Measurement is measurement that occurs prior to implementing an intervention. These data are used to compare
    with post-implementation data in order to determine improvements due to the intervention. Measures to be used are
    specified in the Baseline Data Collection Plan. This plan identifies the measures and when and how they will be
    collected. In addition, information is also typically provides about who “owns” the data, the collection process
    (manual or automatic), data integrity, security, resource requirements for collection, skills needed, tools available
    and any constraints in collection.
</p>
<p>
    <b>In-Process Measurements</b>
</p>
<p>
    In-Process Measurements are measurements that are used to monitor the progress of an intervention throughout its
    deployment. This form of measurement facilitates the identification of intervention and fixing of problems during
    implementation. The number of in-process measurements taken will vary depending on the length of the project. In-
    process measurements might not be applicable for very brief interventions, when a single data point might be
    sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Retrospective Measurement</b>
</p>
<p>
    Retrospective Measurement is final measurement that occurs at the end of the intervention deployment. This does not
    necessarily mean that the intervention is terminated and taken out of service, but that a point has been reached at
    which the intervention is sufficiently mature that it can be retrospectively measured. Based on this data, Return on
    Investment (ROI) or other valuation calculations can be done.

    The Measurement Menu section of the Learning Measurement Plan and Data Repository work product is used for identifying
    and prioritizing the potential measures derived from a causal chain or other measurement inventory process. It is
    crucial that these measures be clearly linked with desired business results.
</p>
<p>
    A Measurement Menu should use a three-column format:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The first column is used for the proposed measures.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The second column is used for the strength of the linkage of the measure with the intervention – Strong (S),
            Moderate (M), or Weak (W).
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The third column is used for the ability to measure – In other words, accessibility or availability of the data
            for the proposed measure – High (H), Moderate (M), Low (L).
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    &nbsp;The Learning Measurement Plan and Data Repository are used to document the measures to be used and house the data
    to be collected over the life of the project. The form is divided into two parts: Business Measures and Learning
    Outcomes.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Business Measures is a list of the highest priority measures selected from the Measurement Menu. Prepare the form
        with columns for each expected measurement to be collected, including multiple columns for repeated in-process
        measurements.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Predictive Measurement column is for an estimate of the impact of the intervention on each measure. This
            can also be interpreted as a goal or target value.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Baseline Measurement column is for data collected before the implementation of the intervention.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The In-Process Measurement columns are for data collected during the implementation of the intervention.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Retrospective Measurement column is for data collection after the completion of the implementation.

    The following advice and guidelines will help you ensure the greatest success in using the Learning Measurements work
    product:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Measurement Menu represents a preliminary list of potential measures. Think of it as similar to the menu in a
        restaurant; you need to choose the items (measures) that you feel are most appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The selection of measures is extremely important. It is always best to select operational measures that are
            already being collected. This will reduce the data collection burden and cost. New measures should be used when
            the measures will add real value.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Proposed measures should be rated in terms of the accessibility of measurement data. It is very important that
            measurement not be a chore. Most measures should be routinely tracked by the organization. Be careful not to
            select measures for which data will be too difficult to collect.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Utilize existing data collection to the extent possible. For example, if your client is collecting weekly
            reports that record types of rejections, errors or defects, then record and use that data.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Collect both in-process and outcome data, if possible. While the process data can help pinpoint improvements in
            the intervention, e.g., process, outcome data in the form of the predictive and retrospective measures are
            critical to linking interventions to business results
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Make sure that you budget for collecting data around multiple in-process measures.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Use interviews and observation (qualitative methods), as appropriate, to record and track in-process measures.
            Don’t just rely on quantitative (numerical) methods.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            As a rule of thumb, a sample size of 50 is considered the mimimum number of data points for results that are
            representative of the population. Selecting a smaller sample from a given population would produce results that
            may not be consistent with the results from analyzing the entire population.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            One way to verify process improvements using in-process measures is to compare the output of the project or
            process after implementing the recommeded changes with the output obtained before making these changes to the
            intervention. The conclusions can benefit both current and future interventions depending on when you analyze
            the data.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            If you get inconsistent results from multiple in-process measures, this may be attributable to various factors
            including the measures, the data collection process, the training of the person(s) collecting the data, the
            instructor/mentor who taught the person collecting the data, etc
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Predictive Measurement has one great advantage over the other phases of measurement – your data can be based on
            estimates, rather than actual data. However, this is a two-edged sword. There is the danger of selecting
            measures for Predictive Measurement that cannot be measured in the real world of the organization.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Predictive Measurement estimates should be checked for credibility with other stakeholders before they are
            finalized.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            All measurements, except for In-Process Measurement, should be single data points. Unless the intervention
            implementation is very brief, it is advisable to do a number of in-process measurements. In-process measurement
            should continue until the completion of the intervention.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            When specifying measures, define the measure (e.g., warranty costs), the data collection method (e.g., warranty
            costs database), and any special conditions related to the measure (e.g., data between August 1, 2001 and
            December 31, 2002).
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Learning Outcome Measures include measures of the other traditional levels of learning measurement and is set
            up similar to the Business Measures section.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Predictive column is for pre-intervention estimates or to set a goal or target for Levels 0-3 measurement.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Baseline column is for recording pre-intervention data.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The In-Process column lets you track changes during the deployment of the intervention, if appropriate.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Retrospective column is for post-implementation data.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            In addition to the information recorded in the Learning Measurement Plan and Data Repository Form, other
            information is useful for maintaining high-quality data collection. It is useful to identify as much of the
            following information as possible and record notes on them as an appendix to the Learning Measurement Plan and
            Data Repository Form.
