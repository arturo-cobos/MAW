    The Process Scenarios describes a sequence of events, triggers, actors, inputs/outputs, and business rules that govern
    segments or paths of a process associated to each area of business operations.
</p>
<p>
    The work product applies to business processes within an enterprise and outside an enterprise, such as processes
    performed with business partners. It also applies to IT processes as well as IT support processes related to things
    like systems management and help desk.
</p>
<p>
    Process Scenarios enhance client understanding of the future business solution by relating processes to daily business
    activities. They act as a means of positively communicating business process enablers as well as set expectations as to
    the limitations of the package or technology to be used.
</p>
<p>
    The design team should have a clear understanding of the scope of the engagement, the business strategy and desired
    capabilities. The project team should also have a common high-level understanding of the major process changes to be
    implemented.
</p>

    Process Scenarios help the design team understand the needs of their client and the functions that will meet those

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Brief Outline</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Process Scenarios are generally depicted both graphically and textually.&nbsp; The textual aspects include outlines,
    story ideas, potential impact areas and trigger events.&nbsp; Tables or statements are usually used to depict future
    state, logical sequences of events, impacts to the business based on issues identified by the engagement), as well as
    known gaps in the business solution that will need to be addressed in order to satisfy each key scenario.&nbsp; The
    graphical representations may be conceptual, showing pictures of the business process and roles as well as utilizing
    the process definition.
</p>
<p>
    Process Scenarios typically have the following sections:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Business Profile: A description of the business situation and what value it provides.&nbsp; A description of the
        customer, location, preferences, and any other details that are appropriate to the scenario.&nbsp; It should
        represent a unique path of business operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Background: the business situation driving the scenario.&nbsp; This section contains information about how the
        customer will utilize the business process and the interactions required.
    </li>
    <li>
        Narrative (in the picture mentioned ‘Scenario Description’): what happens.&nbsp; A story is told about what the
        customer experiences and does.&nbsp; Included are decisions that the user makes and the consequences.&nbsp; Each
        scenario describes the interaction at the action level and contains, per action, the Current description, the
        Future descriptions, the gap in capabilities and the process enabler that may be employed to fill that gap.&nbsp;
        The Process Scenario identifies the frequency of the work step/task, changes or improvements and geographic
        location for the action.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the picture: Expected Outcome
    </li>
    <li>
        Illustrations: enriching the communication.&nbsp; Sketches of the customer’s experience are often used to
        supplement the text.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Risks & Assumptions: The risks and assumptions are typically documented in lists or tables, which may include
        supporting information (e.g., for risks the potential impacts and actions to mitigate).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Process Enablers:&nbsp; identification of which enablers can be leveraged to support the customer scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rules/Exceptions: describes business rules, conditions and potential variations that may impact the customer
        scenario.<br />

        Process Scenarios provide the bridge from the process to technology, as they look at the practical application of
        Business Process Enablers to specific customer situations.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Process Scenarios developed in this work product will be at a high level and for example will not include
        definition of data elements.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        In large projects where multiple teams are working on different processes it is important to verify the detail and
        level of the documentation for consistency.&nbsp; Since multiple people will be creating and writing the files,
        there is always a very high potential for the information to be documented at various levels of detail.&nbsp; An
        example of a completed template should be provided, as well as, a quality check performed after each team member
        has completed one or two.
    </li>
    <li>
        Process Scenarios should be held and maintained centrally.&nbsp; Individual project team members will be
        responsible for updating them.&nbsp; All team members should have display access to the full set.&nbsp; This will
        help everyone to be informed about proposals made by other teams, especially regarding process and role changes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Extensive preparation before the Scenario Development Workshop is necessary to create the necessary tools and
    environment.&nbsp; Education at both the executive and working team levels is critical to successful scenario
    development as it will make them more knowledgeable and productive throughout the process, and will help set realistic
    expectations.
</p>
<p>
    In instances where new scenario development is not feasible or desired, consideration should be given to using
    previously developed scenarios (by industry, industry segment, business area, etc.) as available.
