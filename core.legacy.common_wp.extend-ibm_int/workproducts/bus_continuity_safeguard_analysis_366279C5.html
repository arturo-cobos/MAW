    This analysis&nbsp;produces solution recommendations to mitigate risks identified during the creation of the Business
    Continuity Threat Analysis work product.
</p>
<p>
    Solution recommendations may come in many different forms: Risk Avoidance, Risk Transfer, Risk Distribution, Risk
    Acceptance, or Risk Reduction. Some times recommendations can have little or no cost attached such as implementing new
    policy or improving awareness. However, where recommendations involve the installation of a new safeguard (e.g. fire
    suppression systems, security guards, fences, etc.) the cost must be evaluated and substantiated by the
    consultant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    In choosing risk mitigation techniques, one must assess whether it is best to Transfer, Accept, or Avoid the risk. A
    company transfers its risk when it engages an insurance policy or places funds in a trust for use to replace the asset.
    Accepting a risk means that the effect of the impact from that risk is acceptable to the company. A company usually
    chooses to avoid or mitigate the risk by employing safeguards that are cost effective and acceptable to the company.

    The analysis recommends safeguards out of a possible 150 for use at the customerâ€™s location.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    It is generally taken that safeguards can fall into three categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Safeguards that prevent incidents;
    </li>
    <li>
        Safeguards that permit the timely detection of incidents that have not been detected;
    </li>
    <li>
        Safeguards that aid in the recovery process after an incident has occurred.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The goal of a safeguard is to reduce the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) of one or more incidents, thereby reducing the
    overall ALE for the enterprise. This reduction is calculated by noticing that various safeguards impact the overall
    system in different ways. Three different forms of impact have been noted:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The reduction in certain evaluative parameters for assets (for example the (recovery) safeguard of Insurance can
        reduce the Replacement Cost of all assets covered by the insurance);
    </li>
    <li>
        The reduction in the level of vulnerability in certain areas. For example the (preventative) safeguard of Data
        Encryption can significantly reduce the vulnerability called Disclosure (or Data Disclosure); the (detective)
        safeguard of Monitor System can act to lessen the difficulty that can arise from the slowly degrading Reliability
        of hardware components;
    </li>
    <li>
        The reduction in the frequency of a threat (or threat event) (for example, the safeguard called Training is
        expected to reduce the frequency of the threat of Errors).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Not only is a safeguard intended to reduce ALE, but also it must do it in a cost-effect way. This analysis considers
    all possible safeguards and their impact on the overall system. For each, in turn, a full Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)
    is performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    This analysis uses the reduction in ALE, expected annually, as the benefit and the initial and maintenance costs over
    the lifetime of the safeguard, and considers three different possible discount rates of 5, 10 and 15% to permit the
    calculation of the net present value of all projected figures.
