<ul>
    <li>
        The current and proposed infrastructure - it is paramount that the system integrity and availability is ensured.
        This covers such things as system availability, corruption of data, interface files, dependencies and service level
        agreements. Once programs or tables have been changed, it is important to discuss the implications on other work in
        progress to ensure that awareness is made of the changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        The current and proposed applications - once the source and cause of a problem has been identified, then an
        assessment must be made for its impact on the current applications. This will include changes to tables used by
        applications and the interface files used by those applications. As well as the current set of applications, any
        work in progress must also be investigated for any impact;
    </li>
    <li>
        The current and proposed internal functions - the internal functions of the system or network need to be assessed
        to determine if there has been any impact to schedules. A check should take place to assess whether any batch jobs
        have not taken place that should have taken place and whether any other internal system functions have not been
        completed satisfactorily. The assessment should also look at any proposed new system functions to ascertain whether
        they may be impacted by any of the proposed changes.
    </li>
</ul>Emergency Fix Analysis serves as the primary design documentation for the emergency fix. The primary aim of the
emergency fix is service restoration. Some considerations leading to this designation are: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Time to deploy fixes/changes is immediate
    </li>
    <li>
        Chosen fix may be only temporary in nature
    </li>
    <li>
        Severe degradation in system service level capability, as experienced by the client.
    </li>
</ul></td>

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Brief Outline</th><td class="sectionTableCell">The impact assessment is documented in free format text and should record details regarding: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The availability of the system – this should include details of any loss of availability of all or part of the
            system. It should state what parts of the system were unavailable with dates and times; this will aid the
            investigation of the problem cause.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Corruption of data – this section should document any systems outputs or application outputs that are in error
            and what the errors are. The same applies to any tables or data files.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Interface files – any input or output files that are received from or sent to other systems that are in error
            should be documented with the extent of the errors
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Dependencies – if the cause of the problem has been identified as being another system, then this should be
            recorded, as there is a dependency on the problem fix before the problem on the current system can be fixed.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Service Level Agreements – the impact to the service as defined in Service Level Agreements should be addressed
            in this section. The problem may have caused an impact on another part of the system because certain jobs may
            not have completed and this could impact other area Service Level Agreements.

    While this engagement model deals with situations of an emergency nature, the quality of the emergency fix is of most
    importance.&nbsp; The model presented here is proposed to have the right mix of time urgency and process engineering
    discipline.&nbsp; Clearly, though, in emergency fix situations, it is critical to return the affected system to a
    normal state of operations as soon as possible.&nbsp; The practitioner must use keen judgement to categorically assess
    the right quality, client impact and resource commitment in order to resolve satisfactorily the situation at hand.
</p>
<p>
    In assessing the impact, the developer should take heed of the symptoms described in the problem incident reports, job
    output logs and system dumps to determine what is happening on the system.&nbsp; When a course of action has been
    determined, then a further analysis should be undertaken to assess any impact the course of action has or is likely to
    have on the system and any recovery actions thought necessary should be recorded.
