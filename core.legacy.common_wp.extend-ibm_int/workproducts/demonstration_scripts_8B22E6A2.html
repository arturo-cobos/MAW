    The Demonstration script provides a sequenced list of presentation steps that cover the client's future business
    processes as defined during the business process definition task. It is used to evaluate each vendor's software and how
    closely the software's business process capabilities match the client's desired future state business processes. The
    Demonstration Script also contains background information on the client to aid the vendor's preparation.
</p>
<p>
    Note that it may not be possible to cover all business process requirements for a client during a demonstration due to
    the limit of the presentation's duration.
</p>
<p>
    The demonstration agenda is the primary component in the Demonstration Script. The client's business requirements would
    take a far longer period to cover than a demonstration schedule will generally permit. The demonstration agenda,
    therefore, establishes the scope, priorities and topic flow for the demonstration criteria. The sequence of topics
    establishes an overall flow, which is critical to viewer understanding.
</p>
<p>
    Each topic within the demonstration agenda will have a listing of questions and issues to be covered. The list of
    detailed issues to be covered should be consistent with the time allotted to this subject area. The issues and
    questions will be presented on a scoring sheet where the Selection Team members will be able to record their
    impressions as numeric scores and as comments. The vendors will be expected to cover each question or issue on the
    scoring sheet to the best of their ability.
</p>
<p>
    Background information on the client's company and its current system will be valuable to the software vendor.
    Information should be provided to enable the vendor to relate the requirements. A glossary of client specific terms and
    acronyms will also be valuable to help the vendors relate to the Selection Team during the demonstration process.
</p>
<p>
    A "Confidentiality Statement" should be provided with the Demonstration Script. This agreement protects the client
    since the demonstration script may include proprietary material.
</p>
<p>
    The demonstration's rating process should be described for the vendors in the Demonstration Script. There should also
    be an explanation on how questions will be handled. Other assumptions and rules with regard to the demonstration should
    be clarified.
</p>
<p>
    A request for a "Reference List" may be included with the Demonstration Script along with other vendor evaluation
    requirements. The Demonstration Script is the document, which is provided to the vendor finalist, so it may be used to
    transmit other selection criteria.
</p>
<p>
    The Demonstration Script is delivered to the software vendors upon notification of participation in the software
    selection process. The scripts should be delivered to the vendors on a timely basis to allow maximum preparation time
    and to enable each vendor to have the same notification of demonstration content.

    A demonstration script is a lengthy textual document, which may require a table of contents.&nbsp; The demonstration
    agenda should appear at the beginning of the document after an initial description of the demonstration purpose and

<div class="sectionContent">
<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Software vendors are often reluctant to follow a demonstration script.&nbsp; Some vendor sales representatives will
    strongly resist the defined demonstration process!&nbsp; It is valuable to deal with this attitude in advance.&nbsp;The
    vendors must be clearly told that they will be required to follow the Demonstration Script process and that failure to
    cooperate could result in removal from the process.
</p>
<p>
    Instruct the client's Selection Team Leader to refuse any vendor request for a deviation from the Demonstration
    Script.&nbsp; The vendors will frequently bypass the IBM consultant in order to obtain authorization for demonstration
    process changes.&nbsp;Deviation from the Demonstration Script should require the agreement of both the client and IBM
    project managers, and the terms of any deviation approval should be transmitted in writing.
</p>
<p>
    Schedule some time at the beginning and end of the demonstration agenda for the vendors to “differentiate” and to
    summarize.&nbsp;Encourage the vendors to do their differentiation within schedule topics, but realize that they will
    strongly desire time at the beginning and end of the agenda.
</p>
<p>
    The client may not see the need for this vendor defined periods in the agenda, but the vendors will fight for this time
    if a reasonable amount is not formally scheduled.&nbsp; Anticipate this potential source of conflict with the vendors,
    and avoid the conflict during the meeting since this will undermine your appearance of meeting control.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Preface the invitation to demonstrate with a warning that each vendor must follow the script.&nbsp; The vendor may be
    required to submit a written agreement to comply with the Demonstration Script when the vendor schedules their
    demonstration dates.&nbsp; A written agreement with each vendor, stating that they will follow the Demonstration
    Script, may be desirable.&nbsp;It is unfortunate that the selected software vendors may not willingly accept the terms
    of the “invitation” to present.&nbsp; IBM, as the project manager, must often document the understanding with the
    vendors that the demonstration script defines the mandatory process.&nbsp;This written agreement may hopefully provide
    an additional measure of presentation control.
</p>
<p>
    Review the meeting objectives and rules with the Selection Team.&nbsp;Define a process for handling client questions
    since time limitations may limit the ability to deal with questions.&nbsp; A demonstration viewer may undermine the
    process due to excessive questions. Time is allotted to each topic, and the scenarios are created to cover key
    issues.&nbsp;The demonstration process is not a complete review of the software's capabilities, and the demos may not
    be able to cover all business functional requirements due to the time constraints.&nbsp; The demonstration agenda is
    the Selection Team's position on what each vendor will be requested to cover.&nbsp; Stick to the meeting agenda because
    this is the only way to maintain control.
</p>
<p>
    Deliver the Demonstration Scripts to the selected vendors via E-mail for speed and proof of delivery.&nbsp;Attachment
    of the Demonstration Script to an electronic mail message is an economical and rapid means of concurrently
    disseminating the document to multiple vendors.&nbsp; The vendors should be telephoned to alert them to expect the
    electronic mail delivery.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the Demonstration Script, it may also be helpful to provide additional background material.&nbsp;This
    may include product catalogs, sample bills of materials and routing, CAD drawings, certification documents, etc.&nbsp;
    These documents may include both hard copies and electronic documents for use as image attachments.&nbsp;It is
    desirable to provide similar materials to all vendors.
</p>
<p>
    Sending the material to all vendors will minimize periodic interruptions as each vendor requests special information.
</p>
<p>
    Vendors may wish to do their own requirements studies.&nbsp;This activity disrupts the client's employees, and it can
    be very time consuming if each vendor requests much time.&nbsp; Since there are work products specifically designed to
    perform detailed business process definition studies, it is inappropriate to repeat this effort with each vendor.&nbsp;
    A pre-defined period of time should be allocated for vendor on-site information gathering, and this time should simply
    be offered to each vendor without exception, if they wish to come.&nbsp; This on-site visit may be performed concurrent
    with the preliminary vendor presentation.<br />
    The Demonstration Script will not cover secondary meetings, such technical review meetings and reference site
    visits.<br />
