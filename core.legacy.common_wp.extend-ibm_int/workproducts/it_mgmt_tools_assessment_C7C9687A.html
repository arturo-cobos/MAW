the design of the "to be" IT management environment by identifying those areas where deficiencies currently exist, where
enhancements could be made, or where there are opportunities to better exploit the current management tools. This work
product helps communicate to the client the additional technology that must be acquired in order to provide a complete
solution for the desired capability. It also positions the client for the subsequent tool selection activities.</td>

    The IT Management Tools Assessment work product identifies existing gaps in tools being used in the delivery of
    services by comparing the generic tool profiles (or tool requirements) with the current tools being used by the client.
    This work product includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A mapping of current tools to required tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of those requirements which are not met by existing tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        Documentation of the generic tools that must be acquired to fill the gaps.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Optionally, this work product could also include some preliminary analysis of potential vendor tools that could fill
    the gaps.
</p>
<p>
    This assessment is generally focused on two complementary views of functional and technical quality. The first "view"
    is concerned with the extent to which the tools support the critical IT management and the quality of that support,
    while the second is concerned with conformance to the future management model and agreed upon guiding principles. This
    includes assessment of the coverage provided by the current tools and the degree to which their functional capabilities
    have been implemented and exploited. The technical quality assessment is concerned with the technical efficiency of the
    current IT management tools, (e.g. their age, stability, reliability, maintainability) and their longer term technical
    potential.
</p>
<p>
    The specific criteria used to frame the IT management tools assessment will depend on the aspects being assessed. The
    criteria may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Functionality
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration
    </li>
    <li>
        Level of automation
    </li>
    <li>
        Usability
    </li>
    <li>
        Reporting
    </li>
    <li>
        Completeness and fit of data
    </li>
    <li>
        Communication
    </li>
    <li>
        Customizability
    </li>
    <li>
        Openness
    </li>
    <li>
        Performance
    </li>
    <li>
        Cost
    </li>
    <li>
        Vendor support
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Typically these criteria will be assessed from each of three different perspectives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Capability - How completely the specific tool can meet the requirements of the client for a particular IT
        management process
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementation - How completely the tool is currently implemented at the client?
    </li>
    <li>
        Requirement - The level of implementation of the tool that the client requires for this IT management process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Analysis of the IT management tools from each of these perspectives will identify gaps in the functionality of the
    current tools and in the way they have been implemented.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Brief Outline</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    This work product will generally have several components. These will usually include:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An inventory of the current IT management tools. This will typically be a simple list of the current management
        tools.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        A mapping of the current tools to the management processes and managed elements they support. This will generally
        be in the form of a matrix. The matrix will have management processes along one axis and managed elements along the
        other axis (as does a Systems Management Framework Design matrix). Within each cell will be the name of the tool
        (or tools) used to perform that management process for that managed element.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        An assessment of the current implemented and required level of capability for each tool area. This will usually
        consist of one or more completed tool assessment score sheets.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        An analysis of the gaps, strengths and weaknesses of the current management tools portfolio and recommendations for
        improvement. These will usually be a text report, sometimes supported by other analytical tools used to assist in
        prioritizing the recommended actions.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Creation of this work product will generally require some degree of technical expertise or familiarity with the tool
    suite currently being used by the client.&nbsp; It is advantageous if the team member responsible for this activity has
    this expertise so that they are able to adequately explore and recognize how well the tool has been implemented and the
    degree to which its true capability is being exploited.
</p>
<p>
    The matrix framework used to analyze the current tool coverage is based on techniques used within the Systems
    Management Framework Design (SMFD) method.&nbsp; Therefore it is also advantageous if the engagement team is familiar
    with this method and the construction of the SMFD matrix.&nbsp; If structured appropriately, this IT Management Tools
    Assessment can also provide a strong linkage to the subsequent design activities based on SMFD.<br />

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Impact of not having</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Management tools are an essential component of an IT management system. They support the automated execution of many
    management tasks that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive if performed manually. They are one of the key
    enablers of efficient and consistent IT services delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    Without this work product, it may not be possible to effectively address issues with the current IT management tools or
    identify enhancement requirements during the design of the "to be" environment.
</p>
<p>
    Without an adequate understanding of the current tool suite and the tool requirements it will be difficult to ensure
    that the future design will support the client’s requirements. There is also an increased risk that the "to be" design
    may not adequately build on or integrate with the current management tools suite or that there may be unnecessary
    duplication of function.
</p></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    This work product may not be necessary in situations where there are no tools being used to support the management
    functions within scope. This may be the case for a new venture or for an existing function that is being performed
    completely manually. Alternatively, if the client has determined that none of their current management tools will be
    retained in he future environment then it will not be necessary to assess them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, this work product may not be necessary in more narrowly focused engagements where the analysis revolves
    primarily around other aspects of the IT environment (such as process or organization) or other assessment work
    products.
