    The Procedures Documentation work product identifies and documents the procedures required at the execution level of a
    business process and is prepared for all activities within the business process.&nbsp; The execution level of a process
    is the lowest description level of a business process and deals with activities and worksteps in terms of who is
    responsible, what they do and how do they interact with the technology that supports them. The procedures should be
    detailed enough that employees would understand how to perform their daily activities and tasks. The procedures include
    the sequence of the worksteps, decision points in the activity and explanations of how to use screens/application
    functions and tools that support execution of each of the worksteps.

    A&nbsp;Procedure work product may consist of three major elements:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The narrative description of the process as described below.
    </li>
    <li>
        The detailed process map that shows the flow of work through the process at the activity level.
    </li>

        The detailed activity procedure at the workstep level is depicted in the table depicted in <em>Activity

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Narrative Description:<br />
    </strong>Generally the following paragraph headings are used, which ensure that the form of the procedure conforms to
    the relevant international or governmental standards. The actual format may be governed by national or international
    standards such as ISO 9000 or by the clients internal standards, but generally the following information may be
    required:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Title</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong>&nbsp; (What is to be done, including frequency when applicable)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Responsibilities and authorizations:</strong> (Who is involved)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Actions:</strong>&nbsp; (Who does what, how is it done and when is it applicable)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Documentation of resources and touch points:</strong> (What materials, equipment, documents are to be used)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Quality records</strong> (what information is be maintained, where and for how long)
    </li>
    <li>

</p>
<p>
    When process procedures are being developed, they are typically based upon the performers and the activities performed
    at the lowest level of detail.&nbsp; During Process design the detailed process map is prepared and is used to assist
    in the definition of the procedures.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Activity Description</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The following template represents the information necessary to prepare the procedure at the activity level and is
    generally prepared during the detail process definition phase of an engagement.&nbsp; Completing the Workstep column
    typically starts the template, As the process definition continues logic is added to the worksteps if necessary.&nbsp;
    Then the IT references are completed and finally the inputs and outputs are completed.&nbsp; The IT references are
    prepared in conjunction with the application developers to ensure that the application will provide the appropriate
    functionality.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><ul>
    <li>
        Use the process definition documentation that already exists for the processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Training requirements for the personnel responsible for the execution of the activities needs to be identified in
        detail.
    </li>
    <li>
        The integration and technology touch-points in the procedures need to be highlighted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the subject matter experts - the client staff who are actually performing the tasks.&nbsp; This helps ensure
        that the procedure really reflects what happens, and helps to gain their 'buy-in' when new procedures and processes
        are being implemented.
    </li>
    <li>
        In writing procedures, take into account the skill levels of the employees who will be executing the process.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test the procedure with walkthroughs and pilots where possible prior to release.
    </li>
    <li>
        Train all affected staff in the new procedure.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep in mind the following points when conducting a job/task analysis: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                A job/task analysis is not an outline of the course; rather, it is a breakdown of relevant job
                accomplishments into their component tasks and subtasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                A job/task analysis is not performed to identify what students need to know (subject matter content).&nbsp;
                A content analysis, performed after the job/task analysis, identifies required content.&nbsp; Rather, the
                job/task analysis identifies what students should be able to accomplish (produce) back on the job and the
                tasks that are required to produce those accomplishments.
            </li>
            <li>
                In conducting a job/task analysis, forget about what students need to know or learn during training (this
                actually hinders the analysis).&nbsp; Instead, focus on what students need to be able to produce on the job
                and on identifying the tasks they must perform to produce those outcomes.<br />

shape of a Job/Task Analysis (JTA). The JTA outlines job accomplishments hierarchically, rather than the processes that are
needed to reach these accomplishments. As organizations are typically more interested in the results of a process, rather
than in the processes by which they are reached, the JTA helps identify the objectives needed to complete training, while
avoiding material that is unessential to the organization’s training needs.</td>
