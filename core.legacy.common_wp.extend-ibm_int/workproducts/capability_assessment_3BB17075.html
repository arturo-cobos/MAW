    The purpose of the <b>Capability Assessment</b> work product is to establish the relative strengths and weaknesses of
    business or IT capabilities against a desired future state or value proposition. This assessment is the foundation for
    selecting and assessing processes, organization and technology that enable each capability.
</p>
<p>
    The reasons why this work product is produced are to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide overall context and understanding of the current state of business or IT capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the current status and improvement opportunities within each of the selected capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide an understanding of the impact on current processes, organization, and enabling technologies.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify and prioritize the specific client business and IT capabilities and enablers that will be included in the
        scope of this transformation initiative and enable a plan to be created.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assist the client in thinking through their business and IT strategy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assist in gaining executive agreement to the scope and boundaries.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide the basis for sizing the effort required to understand and assess the current environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a record of the scope and boundaries and assist in managing expectations regarding the scope.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assist in communicating the impact of the redesign across the business.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify what skills, knowledge, and background are required from the project team.

        Comparison of the current state of a capability compared to a future requirement of that capability

    <li>
        Determination of the strength or weakness of a current capability to support a value proposition or outcome

    <li>
        Determination of selected enablers' (Organization, Process and Technology ) strengths and weaknesses that comprise
        the capability

        Prioritization of the capabilities based on an importance ranking and performance rating of each capability to the

    Depending on the number of processes or capabilities selected, the output for this work product can be of considerable
    volume.&nbsp; The minimum output is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        One page of tabular data showing the assessment ratings for each process or capability and their overall priority
        rank.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        One page of graphics that positions each selected process within the dimensions of performance versus leverage
        importance
    </li>
    <li>
        One page for each selected process that contains a formatted definition and description summary
    </li>
    <li>
        One page for each selected process that lists its assessment ratings along with supporting rationale
    </li>
    <li>
        One page for each selected process that lists identified opportunities for improvement (i.e. capability gaps)
    </li>
    <li>
        A list of all sub-processes (within the project scope) that have been classified as "Critical", "Industry Standard"
        or "Basic" for the purpose of further definition and package function fitting.

    Additional supporting documentation:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Flow diagrams of each selected process, showing the key functions/ activities, their relationships and identifying
        their current performers, is very desirable.&nbsp;

<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    When facilitating the process or capability assessment exercise, allow client team members to use a more granular
    rating scale (i.e. L+, H-, etc.).&nbsp; This will also help achieve a consensus opinion on the rating of each
    assessment category and goal linkage.&nbsp; In some e-strategy engagements the assessment may be as simple as
    identifying it as a strength or weakness and then providing some descriptions as to the weakness and potential
    corrective actions rather than even doing high level process flows.
</p>
<p>
    If the scope of a transformation project is driven by the clientâ€™s business strategies/goals and/or customer
    imperatives, output of the "As-Is" Process or Capability Assessment work product should directly support the process or
    capability selection with rationale such as process or capability performance and process capability linkage to goals
    or value propositions /outcomes.<br />

    If the capabilities that will be transformed to support required value propositions are not defined and assessed, then:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It will not be possible to scope and size transforming initiatives.
    </li>
    <li>
        There will be no basis for prioritizing the focus on various enablers (people, process, technology including
        package functionality) for fit and closing capability gaps

        gaps will be difficult to make
