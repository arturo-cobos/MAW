<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The primary purpose of the Strategic Fit Assessment is to VERIFY and qualify the newly developed business strategy or
    initiative(s) from the perspective of relationships (fit, or lack of it) between the Business Strategy and the external
    and internal factors; between Business Strategy building blocks or/and between the initiative(s) and the enterprise
    strategy.
</p>
<p>
    The secondary purpose of performing this work product is to gain a common awareness and good understanding of the
    client's business strategies in a more comprehensive manner than provided by the Strategic Direction work product.
</p>
<p>
    On the business strategy development engagements the purpose of this work product is to ensure/validate that the
    proposed business strategy addresses the external and internal factors in the most appropriate and efficient way, as
    well as that it is internally cohesive.
</p>
<p>
    On the business transformation, process change, ERP project the purpose of this work product is to determine the fit
    between the enterprise strategy and the proposed strategic initiative(s). These initiatives are usually identified with
    the IBM assistance during the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    Increasingly, IBM consultants may be asked to validate or assess a business strategy fit in the context of
    "e-business". The analysis is then focused on answering the following questions: Does the strategy adequately address
    the challenges and opportunities represented by e-business? Is the client being aggressive enough in considering value
    system implications of e-business? How does the client's e-business strategy compare to competitors'?
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion, this work product is developed to verify alignment of the business strategy and/or identify alignment
    opportunities for the client's business strategies with their stated goals, desired market position, customer’s wants
    and needs, value propositions, strategic initiatives and enterprise capabilities, as well as to broaden understanding
    of the client’s business strategies.

    addresses the alignment and effectiveness of the business strategy components in the three major areas:

    of the engagement and the client requirements.

    The output of the Strategic Fit Assessment can be a presentation and report, comprised of both text and graphics, which
    contains contents such as any or all of the following:

    This work product should produce a presentation and report, comprised of both text and graphics, which addresses the
    following areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An updated or validated statement of the client's Strategic Direction (Vision, Mission, Goals & Objectives,
        Critical Success Factors), which addresses clarity, coherence and mutual reinforcement of the components. The
        relationships between the components are depicted in a dependency diagram, which visualize hierarchy, links and
        strength of the support/influence relationship. Various arrow connections indicate various strength and relevance
        of the dependencies.
    </li>
    <li>
        An assessment of how the business strategy is addressing the external drivers of the business environment and
        desired strategic market positions (products, customer, access). The dependency diagram is used to depict how the
        strategic goals and objectives influence achievement of the desired market position. Also, a gap analysis graph can
        be used to visualize the gap between current ("As-Is") and desired ("To-Be") position.
    </li>
    <li>
        An assessment of how the desired or current enterprise capabilities are supporting achievement of the business
        strategy. The analysis is reaching beyond the capabilities level into the base elements contributing towards these
        capabilities such as: processes, organization, human, financial, material and information resources as well as
        enabling infrastructure. The analysis may include intangible elements such as management preferences and corporate
        culture. The dependency diagrams and the gap graphs can be used to visualize the findings.

        The work product analysis should include the implication of e-business on the client’s competitive arena.&nbsp;

        conclusions.

    Developing this work product use the following matrices wherever appropriate: Business Drivers to Goals, Goals to

<p>
    Validation and verification is conducted by reviewing the interpretation of the strategic direction of the firm (i.e.,
    mission, vision, CSF's, etc.), and all key findings relative to product/service/access and capability positioning and,
    as well as the identified gaps and high level recommendations to close them with the client sponsor and appropriate
    senior executives and the client's key managers.
</p>
<p>
    It is critical to hold a peer/quality assurance review and share the deliverables with the consulting team so everyone
    knows what the client's strategic business direction is and which capabilities must be built/enhanced since this work
    product sets the stage for initiative identification, justification and prioritization.

        The project may not address important strategic opportunities or develop strategic capabilities because the

<ul>
    <li>
        The client has recently performed an equivalent analysis (with or without IBM's involvement) and is willing and
