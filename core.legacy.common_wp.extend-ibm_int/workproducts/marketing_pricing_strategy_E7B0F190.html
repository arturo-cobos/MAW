    This work product description provides management with a framework for establishing prices. With such a framework,
    managers can make pricing decisions faster and with a greater awareness of the impact on buyers’ actions.
</p>
<p>
    When researching and conferring about pricing options, marketing decision-makers should consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Market Segments
    </li>
    <li>
        Desired position for the offering
    </li>
    <li>
        Distribution channels
    </li>
    <li>
        Geography
    </li>
    <li>
        Competitors
    </li>
    <li>
        Inherent nature of the offering; e.g., commodity versus specialty
    </li>
    <li>
        Price sensitivity
    </li>
    <li>
        Value added to basic offerings
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This work product description also helps management establish a system for monitoring pricing impact over time.
    Management will need to see pricing trends and the impact of pricing on the financial performance of products and
    services. The information provided in the report will help the management team choose the right pricing strategy to
    meet the business objectives of the organization.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Main Description</th><td class="sectionTableCell">This work product description is intended to provide marketing decision-makers with a structure for making optimal pricing
decisions for products and services. In recent years this has become more complex due to: 
<ul>
    <li>
        The broad availability of information, including pricing information.
    </li>
    <li>
        The rise in services, which are more difficult to price.
    </li>
    <li>
        Accelerating technologies, which make the pricing of frequent complex transactions feasible.
    </li>
    <li>
        The micro-segmentation of markets, which leads to such pricing nuances as premium pricing, seasonal pricing, daily
        pricing and other niched pricing tactics.

    First, develop a standard configuration of the product or service that will meet the average customer’s needs and
    identify the maximum and minimum price levels that this customer segment is likely to support for such a
    solution.&nbsp; The maximum price is calculated by taking the net present value of all future benefits and costs
    derived from the functional, process, and relationship activities that will accrue over the lifetime of the
    solution.&nbsp; Since this analysis will be performed on an incremental basis, the benefits should represent only
    marginal increases to those delivered in excess of those of the current solution.&nbsp; The solution benefits span
    across operational efficiencies, capital cost savings, and could include intangible value benefits.&nbsp; This step
    also requires netting out customer’s incremental operating and capital costs accrued over the same period associated
    with the adoption of this solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The minimum price is determined by the actual cost borne by the client in delivering the product or service.&nbsp; This
    includes sunk costs such as R&D, fully burdened SGA, and ongoing support costs.&nbsp; Techniques such as activity
    based costing provide a clear representation of the total cost of delivery.&nbsp; Obviously, if the minimum price point
    is greater then the maximum price point, the service may not be viable to bring to market.
</p>
<p>
    The next step is to determine a position within the band created between maximum and minimum price points.&nbsp; This
    decision is based on a combination of factors to include positioning of competitors within the value map, customer
    pockets of concentration along the value equivalence line, and overarching product and branding strategies. For
    example, if a company wants to introduce a new product or service, and build a core customer base around which the
    company can launch future product extensions, then the entry price point may be defined at the lower end of the pricing
    band and protect a right to increase price with value added offering.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Finally, a price point may need to be customized for individual customers and channels.&nbsp; An understanding of the
    specific wants and needs of various customer groups, barrier and adoption hurdles, expected and perceived cost, and
    committed volumes are some of the factors necessary to customize price points for individual customers and channels
    when developing a new product or service.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    When presenting this to clients, it’s important to explain the method used and the test bed that was pulled for the
    information.&nbsp; A detailed breakdown, based on predefined client criteria (what’s important to the client – gaining
    market share, building brand equity, loss leader et al) should be explained and the impact considered for each
    component examined.

    Pricing strategy typically involves extensive analysis of internal and external factors. Furthermore, it often involves
    the blending of multiple approaches. The client team will likely have an established pricing strategy in place if it is
    not in the process of launching a new product or a new venture. Review the existing policies and research documents to
    facilitate planning for the next pricing decision.

        Managers may become overly reliant on a cost-plus pricing scheme or other single dimensional approach to pricing.

        The company may find it difficult to react to the pricing actions of existing competitors and new market entrants.
