</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Access to multiple repositories, with different owners (both internal and external)

    <li>
        Access to content in disparate and/or inconsistent forms (data base, document, etc.)

    <li>
        Integration of dissimilar content from multiple sources (internal business units, merged/acquired business
        units/contents, externally sourced content)

    <li>
        The business issues associated with access to externally sourced content, and
    </li>
    <li>
        The consumption of and compensation for use of content via the Web.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Competition over the web, for example between the leading Portal sites and internet start ups is driven by
    differentiation around features such as, brand, programming appeal, ease of use, security and choice, in terms of
    ordering traditional products, or of downloading content via the web. Securing the rights to acquire, distribute and
    use content over the web could be critical to the success of the e-business transformation initiative. Therefore, the
    plan for acquiring and securing the rights for secure web distribution of content should be identified before
    performing the application design.
</p>
<p>
    The Content Sourcing Plan must identify and resolve internal sourcing issues resulting from content ownership by
    multiple business units or organizations. These content repositories may have been developed independently over time
    and may (will probably) lack common vocabulary, design, business objectives, staffing and support requirements.

                    updated? Will the user be advised of changes? How? How much in advance (time) of the change? Who will

        <div>
            When creating the Content Model, it is worth identifying any high level issues that may surface as a result of
            a requirement to use external content, any potential showstoppers identified at this stage may change the
            overall scope and approach to developing the content sourcing plan.

    <li>
        <div>
            With internally sourced content, especially in organizations undergoing re-organization, merger, or
            acquisition, it is vitally important to establish clear ownership and escalation procedures, and to articulate,
            document and gain consensus on specific roles and responsibilities. The risk of not doing this is that a given
            site may “break,” and the time to resolution can extend unmercifully while internal political or organizational
            issues are resolved.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            It is highly advisable to schedule regular sourcing plan performance and planning reviews with all owners/users
            of content on a regular, periodic basis, to coordinate plans and changes. It may be of particular importance,
            where similar content (e.g., customer information) is held in multiple repositories, to establish clear,
            content strategic ownership, and develop content convergence and integration plans.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            It is extremely dangerous to make the assumption that all necessary content will be available and accessible,
            and consistently defined and managed simply because it is all owned by the same company. The larger the
            company, and the broader the types of content, the greater the likelihood of content sourcing inhibitors.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A common vocabulary (see other Content WPDs) is a core element that can reduce many of the risks associated
            with content sourcing.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Benchmarking, growth and performance is frequently overlooked, and may require detailed data base reviews,
            re-designs, additional copies (which add to operational support complexity and delivery costs). Particular care
            must be given to reviews of transactional and dynamic publishing environments (vs. informational and static
            publishing environments) to assure that content will be delivered with integrity and “at speed” to meet the
            expectations of the users.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Finally, particular care must be paid to data-type content typically used in a transactional environment, which
            may result in direct legal liability via an explicit or implicit online contract between the provider and the
            user.

    Without this work product, the client may be unable to realize objectives originally intended for the Web Site, or may
    inadvertently breach Intellectual Property and other laws.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, key pieces of content or data may be unavailable, inaccurately maintained (i.e., synchronized
    change/update of a pricing file). The risk levels of inaccurate, inconsistent, out-of-date, or inaccurate content
    because of a failure in content sources varies with the general type of content:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Navigational failure</b> - primary risks are user inability to complete desired activity, and a loss of customer
        confidence in the provider’s ability to deliver the sought-after content. The underlying cause may well not be the
        navigational mechanism, and is more typically an underlying content failure in indices, linkages, or
        cross-references that must be maintained to support the navigational paths.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        There is, however, the possibility of a flawed navigational tool as well. For example, some current and publicly
        available Search Engines that have been tested have provided unreliable and inconsistent results. Specifically,
        they return different results lists when the same search is executed repeatedly. In this case, the user could -do
        everything right- to retrieve a piece of specific content, and the underlying classification, indexing, links, etc.
        could be correct, but the user would still be unable to complete the activity because the Search Engine itself
        failed to find and present the content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether the root cause is content-based or truly navigational, the primary symptom is that the web activity is not
        successfully completed, and the user "quits" in frustration. A common feedback that would be symptomatic of this
        type of failure would be variations on "I couldn't get there from -- For example, "I couldn't get to the document
        from my results list." Or, "When I clicked on 'Go to Top,' I went to a product information page."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Information failure</b> - risks range from mis-information level to legal liability for actions based on
            incorrect content (still to be tested in the courts.) In this case, the actual content is incorrect or is
            incorrectly identified to the user. This failure may reflect a lack of content review and control within the
            creation process; or, it may reflect a failure in the content maintenance process.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        For example, if the content is a "Chemical Composition and Safety Sheet", which is required by federal law, an
        information failure could be content accuracy, i.e., incorrect chemicals are listed, or have the wrong percentages,
        or have incorrect safety or emergency procedures; or, the information failure could be that obsolete copies were
        not correctly updated on duplicate, replicated, or downstream servers (that may be in place for performance
        reasons) when the source was updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether the root cause is the actual accuracy of the content, or maintenance of the content, the effect on the user
        is potentially action based on inaccurate or obsolete content. A common feedback that would be symptomatic of this
        type of failure would be "Your information is wrong." Or, "I followed the instructions, but they didn’t work."
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example of a "Chemical Composition and Safety Sheet," this type of failure is potentially catastrophic, in
        that property and personal harm may result.
    </p>

<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>

            <b>Technical failure</b> - primary risk is inability to access the site, or information and the resulting
            failure to meet business purpose. This implies an underlying technology based failure: a network component is
            down, the server is down, there is a problem with the browser, etc.
        </div>
    </li>

        For example, a presentation may be planned, but severe weather at the hosting facility may have taken the power
        out; the net effect is that an attempt to bring up the site will fail.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Transactional failure</b> - risks range from loss of any individual transaction (and resulting revenue, etc.),
        to direct financial exposure and liability for incorrectly executed transactions (incorrect pricing, terms,
        conditions, etc.)
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        A common transactional failure example is related to sales tax on web purchases: if a vendor fails to collect sales
        tax as required by law, based on current and correct legislation, who is responsible for payment of that tax when
        the problem is identified?
