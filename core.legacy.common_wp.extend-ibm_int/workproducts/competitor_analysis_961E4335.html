<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    By reviewing industry trends, it is sometimes possible to identify new threats that the client may not have had in
    their radar. Indeed, in some cases the client may have little information on competitors e.g. when attempting to enter
    a new market or to develop a new capability/product/service.
</p>
<p>
    Examine the industry trend of another branch in which parallel situations regarding your client have occurred or will
    take place.
</p>
<p>
    Be creative and investigate whether it is better to join a competitor than beating him. This may look rather odd or not
    a part of the engagement but will bring much better discussion into the steering committee or project group. It also
    shows you’re an expert in the business your client is in.
</p>
<p>
    It is impractical to research and analyze more than 6 competitors.&nbsp; Narrowing this number done to 3 or 4 focuses
    the research even more and allows an even more in depth review and analysis.&nbsp; In some cases, however, it may be
    necessary to look at many different competitors because they each have unique capabilities or products which the client
    may want to understand or benchmark against.
</p>
<p>
    Ensure that the client is engaged through every point of the analysis.&nbsp; The client should participate in the
    selection of competitors and even more so in the selection of areas of focus for the analysis.&nbsp; Many companies are
    often willing to provide dedicated resources to assist in researching and synthesis.&nbsp; This provides an opportunity
    for some skills transfer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Competitor analysis may sometimes be a tough sell.&nbsp; A few clients may believe they have a good handle on their
    competitors. Others may already have a dedicated market intelligence team.&nbsp; In such cases, practitioners can still
    bring value to the table by presenting new frameworks for analysis, graphical representations and maybe even new
    information not known to the client.&nbsp; The value also comes in the identification of strategic initiatives to
    address threats and achieve competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>
    Do not rely too much on press releases or other publicly available data.&nbsp; One Competitive Intelligence
    professional notes that only about one third of press releases are reliable.&nbsp; By using industry sources or reports
    by research firms like Gartner or Forrester, practitioners can often get a clearer view of a competitor’s true
    capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    Ethical issues. Be careful that the information you have gathered during other engagements will not mix with a
    competitor analysis engagement. Your client expects confidentiality but will ask you everything about his competitor!
</p>
<p>
    First mover. For more than 80 % of the E-business companies a company being first on the market was of first interest.
    Nowadays (June 2001) a competitive analysis helps venture capitalists, board members and all other interest groups to
    make solid decisions.
</p>
<p>
    If your client claims a competitor analysis is too much, to expensive you should consider the appetizer technique. In
    this it means you can offer the opportunity of conducting a benchmark by using scanning techniques. By using a small
    questionnaire (let’s say 10 important, meaningful questions) the outcome could be that devastating the client wants to
    know more. Examples could be the implementation of a customer friendly portal and the connection with the back office
    or the use of CRM and organizational impact in the insurance market.
</p>
<p>
    Gather information about branches that have gone trough similar changes like your client branch does. Try to find out
    what mistakes competitors have made, learn from that, and translate it to your customers’ branch.
