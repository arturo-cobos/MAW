4 primary areas are: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Content Value, as determined by business need and customer perception, and defined in terms of specific,
        measurement points that can be directly correlated to business results;
    </li>
    <li>
        Content (Information) Architecture, as determined by the current information publication hierarchy or
        classification structure(s) and the defined presentation "layout map", standards, formats, and associated style
        definitions which combine to provide the logical view(s) of content at the site, page, and content level;

    <li>
        Content Availability, as determined by identification of content sources, formats, owners, strategic repository
        plans, content elements, and access requirements, and which is the basis for the physical management of the

    A Content Assessment includes all or parts the following components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <strong>Client Customer Segmentation, content correlation, correlated Metric Plan Summary</strong> - Who are
            the customers? What are their purposes and characteristics? Which customer sets or types are strategic? What
            content or information is needed to make them successful? In what formats? What are the specific attributes of
            content that have value (e.g., timeliness, accuracy, customer specificity (personalization), access (search),
            etc.)? Which of those purposes drive specific business objectives? What will be measured, against what specific
            targets to demonstrate that the desired results are being achieved? This may be laid out in a series of
            matrices and/or charts, with accompanying customer/content need profiles and recommendations.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <strong>Information Architecture Summary</strong> - How is content currently organized, and is that structure
            adequate to support the needs identified by the previous customer content needs analysis? How is the content
            currently classified? Is there a common vocabulary across the business units? Are terms cross-referenced in
            indices and/or thesauri? What are the specific content elements? Are they fully defined as entities, with
            defined descriptive attributes and relationships? Are there established formats and styles for presentation of
            specific types of content? Are these used consistently and effectively?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <strong>Database / Content Repository Summary</strong> – What content is currently available (Data Dictionary
            information)? Where is it, and in what format? Who owns it? Is it accessible? How frequently is it updated? At
            what rate is the volume of content growing? What are the access performance considerations? Does its
            presentation vary based on classification, external configuration, or contractual relationship (e.g., product
            campaign or special promotion vs. product information, customer profiling, customer paid
            subscription/entitlement)?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <strong>Process Review Summary</strong> – summarizes the processes that are established (defined, documented,
            implemented and managed) to support the business objectives. This includes identification of roles,
            responsibilities, policies, procedures, guidelines, and regulations or business rules that will govern the
            delivery of content.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <strong>Readiness Summary</strong> – summarizes the assessment and analysis of the current environment, and
            identifies any core enabling or ramp-up activities that must occur to support the engagement objectives. These
            issues and inhibitors directly affect the schedule of follow-on activities, skills and resources required, and
            business case for the effort. It may identify key tactical efforts that should or must be executed as
            pre-requisites. This should include a summary of any recent site customer surveys or studies that reflect on
            any element of content effectiveness or any elements which directly relate to the quality, navigation,
            organization or depth of the content.

</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    The Readiness Summary should include summary recommendations, with an associated project plan, resource plan and
    schedule estimates to implement those recommendations. Optionally, possible available resources (internal and external)
    may be identified at this time.

<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Thought:&nbsp; Web automation of a current business process is NOT business transformation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The single largest impediment to successful completion of a Content Assessment is a tendency to “boil the ocean.”&nbsp;
    Where new areas are identified, they should be captured, but listed separately for future review.
</p>
<p>
    These “emerging and ancillary issues” may generate new discussions and additional assessments, and presenting them in
    summary format as an addendum to the Readiness Assessment Review (as Emerging and Ancillary Issues) is
    recommended.&nbsp; If the list is extensive, the Readiness Assessment Review may recommend that the plan be reviewed in
    context of the entire list for prioritization by the sponsoring executive.&nbsp; However, the focus must be maintained
    on the scope as defined, based on the sponsor’s business objectives and purpose.
</p>
<p>
    There is a constant and ongoing tension between “Webspeed” and “completeness.”&nbsp; Management of this tension must be
    keyed and constantly calibrated against the business purpose that is identified “up front.”&nbsp; If the activity,
    question, content, application, issue, etc. is not absolutely vital to execution of the business purpose, then it
    should be noted and deferred to the “Emerging and Ancillary Issues” list.
</p>
<p>
    These items should be treated as business opportunities!&nbsp; This list provides the primary means to expand and
    enhance the engagement.&nbsp; It should be reviewed with the overall Project Executive regularly, who may choose to
    escalate the issue(s) separately with the sponsoring executive.&nbsp; Examples include: Site Performance benchmarking,
    proof-of-concept site delivery, usability studies, disaster recovery, etc.
</p>
<p>
    It is the responsibility of the consultant leading this effort to forward these opportunities appropriately, and in a
    timely fashion.&nbsp; Additionally, new or inexperienced consultants should hold regular internal team review
    checkpoints with their team and leadership, to discuss the progress and identify new opportunities.&nbsp; In a 4-week
    engagement, this should happen at least twice: at midpoint, and at the end of the effort.
</p>
<p>
    These discussions may not only serve to clarify opportunities, but also risks.&nbsp; They may also be educational to
    the team on the capabilities of IBM services and its partners.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Impact of not having</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Without this work product, the client will not be able to maintain a clear line-of-sight between their investment in
    content and content delivery and business results. It may result in a lack of focus on pre-requisite enabling
    activities, and unnecessarily increase the expenditure of time and resources on activity and content that do not
    directly correlate to the "critical path" business objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Resulting implementations may lack consistency in presentation, format, purpose and underlying design and style
    standards, which directly (negatively) impact a high-quality consistency in content presentation "look and feel" and
    customer satisfaction and "comfort" with the site. These symptoms may already be present, and reflected in existing
    site studies or surveys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Investments in "reactive" implementations may be made without proper underlying logical and physical infrastructures,
    which results in slower implementations, higher than necessary maintenance costs, slower growth and expansion, and
    eventually, costly re-work. It will impede the client’s ability to transform existing e-business static publishing
    environments to dynamic, transaction - supporting environments.
