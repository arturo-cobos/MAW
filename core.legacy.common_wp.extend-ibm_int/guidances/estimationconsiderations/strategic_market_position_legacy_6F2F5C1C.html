<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">One of the more efficient ways for completing this work product is to provide education to the client and involve them in
the development. On a recent engagement with a major retailer, one consultant day was used for education. During the 3-day
strategy workshop this is usually discussed quite intensely. After the education, it is useful for the client's marketing
team to develop a first cut segmentation cube. After the workshop you could expect to spend another 3 days finalizing the
cube. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>In this engagement, and in many others, the client team will already have customer segmentation output. What they
did not have was a customer-product/category mapping. 3 persons from their marketing team worked on the segmentation cube
in which they refined the customer segments a bit and the product categories quite significantly. This got revisited after
the workshop when several interesting questions came up. This worked well in the retailer engagement but the client was not
expecting us to develop anything new here (still typical when understanding strategy). 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>In the e-strategy world you could expect to at least double the time, as consultants partner with the client in
facilitating the potential development of new e-businesses or the transformation of major components of their existing
business to e-businesses. In these cases, education is paramount (see executive briefing package work product). Additional
time is spent on research, formal CVM work may take place and more interaction with other activities that produce
deliverables related to external influences on the firm and internal capabilities. Strategic Market Positions are iterative
as more information is learned about the external environment and more detailed analysis of internal capabilities is
completed. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>If CVM work is included in the scope of the engagement, depending on the amount of available customer data and/or
the number of targeted customer segments, the time could range from 2-6 weeks. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>The number of focus groups varies. At least one is required for each needs-based market segment (e.g. young
professionals vs. retired people would represent two different needs-based segments for the financial services industry).
Each focus group requires time to identify customer names and telephone numbers, if client customers are to be invited - or
to identify non-customers from the marketplace. A professional focus group facility is often used, requiring a week to
locate and negotiate that firmâ€™s contract. The attendees must be recruited, usually by that firm, requiring time to locate
8-10 qualified persons who will agree to attend. Those parties need lead-time of at least a week to be able to slot/commit
the focus group on their personal calendar.</td>
