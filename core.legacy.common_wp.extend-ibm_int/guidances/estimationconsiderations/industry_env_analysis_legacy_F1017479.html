<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">Industry Environment analysis is an iterative process. More information is learned about the company, market and detailed
value system, while progressing through the analysis. This allows for better defined opportunities and value system
positioning strategies, but can also lead ‘never ending’ analysis iterations. It is therefor very important to define
up-front the scope (breath and depth), and to manage continuously the level of detail during the analysis.

</table>Estimations can vary widely based on, the industry and the client’s position in the value chain, the client’s
entity scope and overall company complexity. Also the various reasons for performing the analysis can result in substantial
variation in the estimates. Anything between 2-3 person weeks and 3-6 person months of effort may be possible, based on
variation in scope and objective. For instance: 
<ul>
    <li>
        If part of a traditional IT Strategy for a CIO the Industry Environment analysis could take 2-3 consultants 2 weeks
        lapsed time, 3-5 days of actual work documenting and obtaining agreement as to the business environment.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                In addition to the above, total of 3 days of consultant time is required for education and review; 2 day
                strategy workshop to present and explain the work products and discussions; and about 10-15 days required
                by the consulting team for workshop preparation and analysis documentation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In an e-business strategy engagement, where you are likely to work with the whole senior management team, the
        estimate could easily be 3 to 5 times the above effort if the scope entails developing a new business model or new
        business or driving to changing the industry structure or the "rules of the game".
    </li>
    <li>
        As part of a IT project for example, to verify whether the scope of the solution will be able to cope with dynamics
        on the demand or supply side. The Industry Environment analysis would then have an ‘assurance’ like objective ("are
        we designing to the right level of environment dynamics"). The analysis would require 2-3 Person weeks of strategy
        consulting effort.
    </li>
</ul>If techniques and samples of Value Systems and Competitive Forces analysis are explained to client senior management
before starting the strategy workshops, the time spent is usually more valuable. Plan for one consultant day for client
team education.

</table>When providing up front education, the client is more in position to do the work. This is not unusual since many
clients do not believe IBM is in the business of defining business strategy (although we are partnering with them more,
especially in e-business), but they do understand the importance of our needing to understand business strategy.</td>
