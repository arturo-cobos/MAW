    <strong>Appendix A: Measuring Learning Effectiveness</strong>
</div><br />
The traditional five levels of learning evaluation are described below, as well as considerations in measuring each of
these levels. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Level 0: Attendance
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Level 1: Satisfaction (also referred to as “reaction”)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Level 2: Learning
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Level 3: On-the-job application
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Level 4: Business results
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><b>Level 0 measures attendance.</b> Answers questions such as: How many people participated in the learning activity
or intervention? Obviously attendance is necessary for learning, but it is not a very satisfactory measure of learning
effectiveness. <br />
<b>Level 1 measures learner reaction.</b> Answers questions such as: Were the participants satisfied with the training?
Using surveys at the end of a session, the trainer finds how well participants liked the training. Although the
participants' enthusiasm doesn't link directly to business results, it's important because reaction can be a leading
indicator of learning. Did the participants like the program? Did they feel it was valuable? Did it meet their
expectations? Were the participants’ needs satisfied? <br />
Level 1 data is typically gathered by having participants fill out evaluation sheets at the end of course indicating their
reaction to the training program. Level 1 feedback has serious weaknesses. Many studies have confirmed a lack of
correlation between overall participant satisfaction and actual learning and subsequent application of the training to the
job. While feedback is essential to judge satisfaction with the training, it is ineffective as an overall evaluation of the
program in terms of learning application and results. Thus, additional levels of evaluation are needed. In addition, other
methods of Level 1 feedback are possible, such as post-learning focus group and interviews. <br />
Level 1 (Reaction) Recommendations: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Don’t focus on participants’ liking of the event, instructor quality, logistics, etc.-- unless you are able and
            prepared to make changes based on this data. The only time that this kind of data is really legitimate is
            during a course pilot.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Instead focus on participants’ “intention to take action” on what they have learned and “confidence in their
            ability” to successfully change their behavior. This is what is most important.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A good Level 1 should really be a <i>predictive</i> Level 3!
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Even if you distribute a survey, consider doing additional random interviews as well. Surveys tend to provide
            very superficial information. Interviews can allow you to probe for what lies behind the initial assessments.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Leave sufficient time at the end of the program for participants to complete a survey thoughtfully...better
            yet, have participants complete the survey as they progress through the program
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><b>Level 2 measures learning.</b> Answers questions such as: What did the participants learn from the training? Did
the training change attitudes, increase knowledge or improve skills? Did the participants learn what they were supposed to
learn? Before-and-after testing demonstrates that learning took place, but not whether it will be applied to the job.
Measures for Level 2 are gathered during or immediately after the training has concluded. <br />
Measuring learning is critical when the organization has determined it is important for participants to have prescribed
knowledge and skills that are necessary and essential for job success. Training objectives usually focus on knowledge and
skills and, sometimes, attitude changes. However, it has become difficult for some organizations to capture the extent of
learning, particularly since testing for learning acquisition is not always considered acceptable or desirable in many
situations. Consequently, organizations have devised a variety of different methods to assess skill and knowledge
acquisition. While objective testing is still important, other methods include a variety of assessments, such as
self-assessments, team assessments, facilitator assessments, performance testing, simulations, case studies, skill
practices, role-plays, and exercises. <br />
Level 2 (Learning) Recommendations: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Every learning program should have some type of Level 2 assessment.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Pre-testing is strongly recommended for two reasons: It will help you avoid wasting the time of people who
            already have mastered the content or are capable of demonstrating the desired behaviors. Remember that lack of
            motivation and environment constraints are major reasons why people don’t do things that they are already
            capable of doing.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Ask meaningful, job-relevant questions, not those that just require short-term memory.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Accountability for learning will increase motivation during the program.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><b>Level 3 measures the application of learning on the job.</b> Answers questions such as: Did the participants change
their behavior based on what was learned? With help from participants, direct reports and supervisors, the trainer gauges
how much participants' behavior has changed on the job as a result of the training. Did the participants apply their new
learning back on the job? How accurately and completely did employee apply learning to the job? <br />
Perhaps one of the most critical issues of training and development is the transfer of acquired skills and knowledge to
actual on-the-job application. A Level 3 follow-up evaluation determines the extent to which skills and knowledge have been
applied on the job. A follow-up evaluation takes time, adds cost to the training and development process, and is often
disruptive. These three issues alone have kept many organizations from appropriately using Level 3. <br />
For many programs, a connection with actual business performance is desired, since it is possible to obtain a positive
application of skills and knowledge yet have no impact on a business performance measure. For example, if the needs
assessment is inadequate or improper, skills and knowledge acquired in the program will not necessarily improve the desired
business performance measures. <br />
Level 3 (Behavior/Application) Recommendations: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Level 3 assessments should not more than just delayed Level 1 assessments.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Focus on the specifics of what people are doing with what they learned. Ask for actual examples.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Don’t hesitate to ask participants to estimate the value of their changed behavior. This data can be used later
            for Level 4 assessment.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Implement the first Level 3 assessment no more than 2-3 weeks after the program. This way it will serve as a
            reminder of the need to take action on what was learned, as well as an assessment.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Consider doing several Level 3 surveys, rather than a single one. However, keep them short.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            There is no substitute for follow-up interviews. A survey form is not sufficient.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><b>Level 4 focuses on business results.</b> Answers questions such as: Did the change in behavior positively affect
the organization? How did the behavioral change translate into improvements for the company? Did the training have any
measurable business impact? What are the business results when the training objectives were met? Is there evidence that the
change in the participants created by training has positively affected business performance indicators, such as customer
retention, repeat business, new customers or increased sales? What is the ROI (return investment) of the anticipated or
actual impact? <br />
The purpose is to identify the impact training has on improving performance throughout the organization. However, this can
be challenging because sometimes it is difficult to understand the connection between business problems and a specific
training need. Some needs assessment processes do not link skills and knowledge deficiencies to business performance
problems or business opportunities. Thus, a more complete needs assessment process may be needed to include business
measures. When this is the case, it is possible to link training to business impact. <br />
The specific approaches to measuring business impact vary. Monitoring business performance is the most common and credible
approach. Specific performance measures are monitored for improvement after a program is conducted, and compared against a
baseline of before-training performance. Other techniques that have proven useful in recent years to measure impact include
action planning, performance contracts, and the use of follow-up questionnaires. <br />
Level 4 (Business Results) Recommendations: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Remember that the most measurable “business results” are at the Individual/Team Performance Indicator Level.
            This is also where Levels 3 and 4 can work in concert together.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Primary data (actual business measures) are best, but don’t hesitate to supplement it with secondary data
            (self-report).
