    <b><u>Sample 1 - Architecture Management Framework</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Introduction</b>
</p>
<p>
    The goal of an Architecture Management plan is to provide a framework for managing the design, deployment and evolution
    of an Enterprise Architecture (covering both business and IT architectures). Through the involvement of the many
    technology stakeholders, the process works to ensure conformance to the architecture while allowing for exceptions to
    meet unique requirements. It also serves to ensure that the architecture evolves to meet new business challenges with
    appropriate technology solutions.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Usage</b>
</p>
<p>
    Users and I/S professionals making design or product selection decisions should consult the architecture for guidance.
    If they are unable to find a solution in conformance with the architecture, they should invoke the Architecture
    Management Process to request a change or variance to the architecture to meet their unique requirement.
</p>
<p>
    The application design and development process interfaces to the architecture management process through formal design
    reviews. This interface provides a structured approach to assisting design teams in conforming to the architecture and
    making design tradeoffs in line with enterprise-wide requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update</b>
</p>
<p>
    The plan should be continuously updated to reflect changes in the organization or communications infrastructure. As the
    architecture matures, the processes, including such activities as design reviews and publication in a newsletter, will
    become an integral part of the I/T infrastructure. By keeping the management processes up to date, the architecture
    will be able to maintain its vitality and maximise return to the enterprise.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Roles and Responsibilities</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    Effective implementation and management of the enterprise architecture involves active participation by several key
    groups. Each group has specific responsibilities and must interact with the other groups as summarised in the figure
    below.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <b><u><img height="367" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/architecture_management_framework_01.GIF" width="584" /></u></b><br />
    <b><u>Management Processes</u></b><br />
    The Architecture Management Framework consists of four sub-processes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Architecture Review and Approval Process
    </li>
    <li>
        Architecture Vitality Process
    </li>
    <li>
        Architecture Exception and Appeals Process
    </li>
    <li>
        Architecture Communications Process
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To ensure the successful implementation of these processes, the Architecture Management Group (AMG) and the Business
    Steering Committee (BSC) will need to establish regular and ongoing informational and working meetings.<br />
    Each of the processes is detailed in the following pages. As the processes are implemented and begin to mature, they
    can be further detailed to reflect implementation specifics such as organization names and contact lists. If possible,
    these highly volatile data items should be kept to a minimum and isolated, to ease the document maintenance process.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    <b>Architecture Review and Approval Process</b><br />
    This process defines a structured approach to reviewing and approving decisions, which should be made in accordance
    with the architecture. Formal design and product evaluation reviews are the key control points for this process.<br />

    <br />
    <b>Critical Success Factors</b> for a successful enterprise-wide Architecture implementation.<br />
    While the AMG has overall responsibility for the successful implementation of the Enterprise Architecture, the BSC and
    architecture stakeholders must work with them to achieve the following critical success factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Clear ownership of the Enterprise Architecture by the Architecture Management Group (AMG)
    </li>
    <li>
        Active sponsorship and championship of the Architecture Management Group (AMG) by the Business steering Committee
        (BSC)
    </li>
    <li>
        Proactive stakeholder and business involvement throughout the process
    </li>
    <li>
        Clear definition of conformance / compliance standards
    </li>
    <li>
        Clear decision making authority / boundaries for the Architecture Management Group (AMG) and the Business Steering
        Committee (BSC)
    </li>
    <li>
        Ongoing education and communication of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) throughout the organization
    </li>
</ul></td>
