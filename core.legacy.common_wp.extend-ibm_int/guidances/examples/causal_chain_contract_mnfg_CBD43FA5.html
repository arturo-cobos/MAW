    The XYZ Company is contract manufacturing firm located near Lexington, Kentucky. Most of its business is in small and
    medium-sized product assembly projects. The company was experiencing a significant increase in expenses due to poorly
    managed projects and reduced repeat sales revenue because of customer dissatisfaction. The company wanted to turn this
    situation around.
</p>
<p>
    The XYZ Company believed that the problem was substantially due to poor project management. The company was ready to
    hire a training company to come in and teach end-to-end project management skills to all project managers. An IBM Sales
    Specialist suggested that the company participate in an initial Organization Performance Improvement (OPI) consulting
    engagement to identify both learning and non-learning performance factors. This engagement identified the skills and
    knowledge that were required for the company to be successful, as well as some non-learning performance factors, such
    as disincentives to manage projects efficiently. The IBM consultants used a Causal Chain to determine the highest
    priority skills and knowledge that linked most closely to their desired business results. The Causal Chain was able to
    pinpoint the highest leverage behaviors that would drive the greatest results and deliver a high ROI to the XYZ Company
    for its investment in training.
</p>
<p>
    A group of XYZ executives, managers, and project managers worked together to create the Causal Chain. The executives
    identified their desired business result as increased profit. The team then identified the components of profit as
    expenses and revenue. They then identified factors in the organization that impacted expenses and revenue, and then
    linked these to individual and team performance. These performance indicators were then linked to specific behavior and
    training. XYZ Company could then see very directly how providing training on key knowledge and skills in risk
    management and project control can impact their bottom line.<br />
    <br clear="all" />
    The XYZ Company Causal Chain for the project management situation is presented below.
