    For every client, the team needs to compute a set of generic and industry-specific ratios during the proposal or
    initialization phases.
</p>
<p>
    These ratios should be used in at least three critical ways:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        To Document and Gain Client Buy-in to Base-line Assumptions,
    </li>
    <li>
        To Analyze Trends, and
    </li>
    <li>
        To provide the basis for preliminary problem diagnosis (value hypotheses) and engagement planning (Work Plan and
        Model).&nbsp;
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Baseline assumptions include:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<img height="404" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finassex1.JPG" width="762" />
</p>
<p>
    Data for the Financial Assessment are generally available from public sources like SEC 10-K/10-Q filings, industry
    associations, and 3rd party databases, as well as from client finance personnel.
</p>
<p>
    Further insights and explanations can often be gained from reviewing the trade press and interviewing client executives
    and industry experts.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="333" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finassex2.JPG" width="740" /><br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    One important role of Financial Assessment is known as “decomposition”.&nbsp; In this simple illustration, we see that
    while the subscription revenue has remained relatively constant over the period in question, the new subscriber revenue
    has been declining precipitously.&nbsp; Seeing this analysis, the team would want to take a closer look at the new
    subscriber acquisition process.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="302" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finassex3.JPG" width="504" /><br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Without this decomposition analysis it would not be clear whether the flat trend in subscription revenues was due to
    customer retention problems or customer acquisition problems.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    Trend analysis in the initialization and proposal phases is very useful in developing the work plan for the engagement.
    These two examples show how a basic profitability trend can help consultants set priorities.<br />
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <img height="319" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finassex4.JPG" width="555" /><br />
    In the case where profits have been trending steadily and sharply downward for a number of years, the threat to
    management and other stakeholders is urgent and serious.&nbsp; To stop and reverse the decline, the project needs to be
    focused on the part of the business with the most opportunity; e.g., high growth markets or operations representing
    large portions of total company costs.&nbsp; Because of the urgency, less time will be spent looking for long-term
    strategic opportunities; the project will be geared to quickly diagnose and correct profitability problems by enhancing
    revenues or cutting costs.&nbsp; This is a common scenario in "quick hits" engagements.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, where profits have been trending steadily and strongly upward, management should be focusing on
    "possibilities".&nbsp; Therefore, the engagement should be built around a comprehensive strategic analysis of the
    business, searching for the best opportunities for big, long-term wins.&nbsp; While "quick hits" should be addressed as
    they arise, they should be treated as part of a broader effort.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, the early financial assessment work can help guide how the team prioritizes its recommendations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    When the profits have been declining steadily and sharply over a long time, the "quick hits" projects are important
    because they can yield results in the next few quarters that can slow or reverse the trend. Instead of prioritizing as
    we normally would, on the basis of NPV (Net Present Value), these trends usually indicate that we should prioritize on
    the basis of payback period.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Why?&nbsp; Because high NPV projects often require large initial investments to yield large cash flow returns in
    subsequent years, they can create negative cash flows that a troubled company may not be able to handle.&nbsp; Fast
    payback projects, on the other hand, may be practically self-funding, contributing immediately to both earnings and
    cash flow.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of a company with strong and steadily growing earnings, "quick hits" should be viewed primarily as
    "prototypes" for testing the long-term vision.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <img height="312" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finassex5.JPG" width="543" /><br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    Since the company is financially healthy, it will typically have the resources it needs to fund strategically important
    projects.&nbsp; Assuming the use of the correct discount rate, NPV is generally the best criterion for prioritizing
    efforts.
</p>
<p>
    Using IRR (Internal Rate of Return) can dispense with the complexity of discount rate selection, but introduces some
    issues of ambiguity which will be discussed in "advanced topics".
</p>
<p>
    The appropriate strategy for any specific competitor to undertake depends on its competitive position and the structure
    of the industry, as quantified in the preceding discussion. The preceding ratio analysis coupled with a quick
    literature review and a few client interviews should give the consulting team a pretty good idea about the underlying
    economics of the business.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="413" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finassex6.JPG" width="815" /><br />
    &nbsp;<br />
    This cursory quantitative understanding is typically sufficient to formulate meaningful value hypotheses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    However, to prove the hypotheses it is sometimes necessary to develop a more complete understanding of the specific
    cost dynamics.&nbsp; In these cases, you will need to quantitatively assess the actual Scope, Scale, and Experience
    economics of the industry.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    To do this, you will need to turn to a subject matter expert to structure the analysis and interpret the data.<br />
