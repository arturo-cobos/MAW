    It will not always be necessary to execute a full benchmark with lots of participating organizations. For several
    business processes success stories about best-in-class performers are published regularly in special literature and on
    Internet. The first steps of the benchmark then can be simplified by just using the performance measurements of the
    best-in-class organization to compare the client’s process to that ‘best-in-class’ and the real effort can be spent in
    analysis of the reasons behind the performance gaps and in defining potential improvement steps. Following this
    approach you have to be aware however that the ‘best-in-class’ organization, although it has the best overall
    performance on the business process concerned, is not necessarily the best on all different aspects of that process.

    In 1999 IBM has won the Purchasing Magazine’s “Purchasing Medal of Excellence”. Since then IBM has supported several
    clients in different industries in benchmarking their purchasing process against IBM’s. The strength of this way of
    benchmarking is that the client gets a detailed and real practical advise about possible improvements in his process.
</p>
<p>
    The example below, based upon a number of real experiences, shows how a benchmark of a client’s Procurement processes
    against IBM’s processes and “best practice” could look like. In these cases IBM’s target situation for its own
    processes was assumed to be “best practice”.
</p>
<p>
    The following table illustrates how the start of the benchmark, a comparison on some selected Procurement Performance
    Measurements between IBM and the client, could look like. Be aware that in organizations that did not yet spend
    specific attention to their purchase process it could appear to be difficult to find this kind of information, because
    they don’t have the appropriate data warehouse environment available.

    To explain the gap between the client’s and IBM’s performances, a detailed analysis has to be done. Because different
    commodities are procured differently, this analysis has to be done at commodity group level. For the benchmarks that
    have been executed a set of questionnaires has been made in cooperation between IBM consultants and SME’s (subject
    matter experts from IBM Procurement). Supported by these questionnaires a number of interviews were held with those
    people (managers, key users, internal customers) at the clients’ who have responsibilities in the end-to-end
    Procurement process for the specific commodity.
</p>
<p>
    During the interviews first the interviewee was asked to describe his/her specific part of the process. Then the
    questionnaire was used to get a more detailed view on it. Next, the interviewers (an IBM consultant and an SME) asked
    whether he/she knew remarks or ideas for improvements and to what extent these were already being taken into account
    and, if not, why not. After that the interviewers suggested and explained alternatives, which they actually knew from
    the IBM-process or from ‘best practice’ and again they asked to what extent these were already being taken into account
    and, if not, why not.
</p>
<p>
    The experience was that most interviewees, being responsible for a specific commodity group, were surprised about IBM’s
    interpretation of the “end-to-end” approach, which appeared much broader than their own interpretation. They for
    example were not used to see Procurement having a major responsibility in organizing an efficient and effective process
    to collect requirements for their commodity and to harmonize the definition of requirements within their commodity.
    Their own interpretation of procurement roles was still much more passive.
</p>
<p>
    The elaboration results of the analysis were recorded in a report with columns indicating:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The current situation
    </li>
    <li>
        The rating of this current situation compared to IBM and to best practice (as perceived by IBM Procurement)
    </li>
    <li>
        Our description of best practice
    </li>
    <li>
        The improvement action that is necessary to improve the situation towards best practice
    </li>
    <li>
        The percentage contribution to the total saving potential for the commodity group concerned that could be reached
        by optimizing the specific part of the process that is handled on the report-line concerned (an estimation is made
        for the total saving potential and, whereas the improvement actions are correlated, it has been tried to indicate
        the saving contribution of the individual action lines)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If necessary the interviewees were approached again to get additional insight and finally they were asked to review the
    resulting table.
</p>
<p>
    Be aware that the text in the columns must be short on one hand but accurate and precise on the other. Key aspect is
    that the interviewees recognize the ‘situation as found’, that they understand ‘best practice’ and the ‘potential
    savings’ and that they are motivated to support the defined improvement actions.
</p>
<p>
    The spreadsheet below (a summary containing ingredients from different actual cases) shows how the result could look
    like for a specific commodity group like Office Supplies or Car Lease.
