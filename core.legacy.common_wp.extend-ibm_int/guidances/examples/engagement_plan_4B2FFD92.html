<P>- Definition of a logical Technical Architecture with defined functions detailed as necessary. Initial implementations of each of these functions, based on current practice and standards, will be included where appropriate <BR>- A formal QA review of the Technical Architecture <BR>- An agreed set of follow-on activities to ensure the successful implementation and management of the TA</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>The agreed deliverables will be produced by end December.</DIV></LI></UL>
<P><B>Resourcing:</B> <BR>Following on from our discussions, we now have a clearer understanding of RETCO requirements. Based on IBM's experience with other, similar sized projects, we believe the resources required for this TA Definition Project will be as follows: <BR>RETCO Resources <BR>TA Owner - half/day week <BR>Team Leader - 3-4 days/week <BR>Team member - 2 days/week <BR>Team member - 2 days/week <BR>Project manager - 1 day/week <BR>Documenter/administrator - 1-2 days/week <BR><BR><B>Note:</B> The last two roles could be combined dependant on the skills and availability of resources within RETCO. However we would recommend that the person designated as Team leader, is NOT responsible for project management. <BR>Whilst we realize that all the workshop attendees are very busy, their knowledge and participation will be key to the success of this project. We recommend consideration of RETCO's senior professionals for the Team Leader/member roles, whilst still making members of RETCO's I/T management team available for key workshops and review meetings. <BR>IBM Resources <BR>Lead <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 /><st1:place><st1:City>IBM</st1:City> <st1:State>SD</st1:State></st1:place> Consultant - 2 days/week <BR>Second <st1:place><st1:City>IBM</st1:City> <st1:State>SD</st1:State></st1:place> Consultant - 3-4 days/week <BR>IBM Specialists - 1 day/week i.e. 13 days as required <BR>QA Reviewer - 6 days <BR>It is anticipated that the core team identified above will undertake the main activities, supported, as required, by other participants as specific requirements and areas are evaluated in more detail. <BR><BR><B>Note: </B>Resourcing requirements will be reviewed on a regular basis as the project proceeds. <BR>Access may also be required to RETCO technical specialists in the following disciplines:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>- Client/Server <BR>- Distributed Printing <BR>- Security <BR>- Database management <BR>- Open Systems <BR>- Multimedia <BR>- Transaction management <BR>- Depot environments <BR>- RETCO Networking</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is estimated that up to 20 days of RETCO's specialists' time may be required during the project. Actual requirements to be defined and agreed with the TA owner prior to commencement of work. <BR><B>Facilities:</B> <BR>A workroom will be required for the duration of the study, with access to terminals and printers for the production of the deliverables. <BR><B><I>Constraints and 'Keys' to Success</I></B> <BR>The constraints to the production of acceptable TA Definition deliverables, within the stated timescales, were identified as follows: </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Resource and interviewee availability within the agreed timescales</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Quality and appropriateness of requirements information available - an initial assessment showed that much of the information needed as input to this project was either documented, or a source (to be interviewed) known.</DIV></LI></UL><B>Note:</B> Unknowns should be documented here too. For example, the PC area was the only one identified where there is no identifiable, single source of information, including the existing inventory, which is two years old. 
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>The availability of adequate facilities (working rooms, documentation facilities)</DIV></LI></UL>The following were seen as key success criteria for this project: 
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>The TA must be able to be communicated to all users, simple to use and update (size and usability)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>The project must produce deliverables, which are tangible, beneficial and relate to the business.</DIV></LI></UL><B><I>Deliverables</I></B> <BR>The following will be the main deliverables from the engagement, to be used as appropriate with senior customers, Systems Managers and members of the Computing Department. 
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>TA Definition Report (60-100 pages)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Executive Summary (5-10 pages maximum)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Presentation materials</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Online User's Guide (format, style and presentation still to be agreed)</DIV></LI></UL>In addition, the Outline Transition Plan section of the TA Definition Report will highlight TA general education requirements and deliverables. <BR>Deliverables will be produced using the Microsoft Office Suite of programs. All source code will belong to RETCO. <BR><B>Review of the TA Deliverables</B> <BR>It is recognized that a key factor to the subsequent successful implementation of the TA, will be its acceptance by RETCO business consultants and I/T professionals. A final list of reviewers has still to be agreed, but will include: 
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Business Consultants</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Technical Consultants (including AD)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>I/T Services.</DIV></LI></UL>Those selected should be representative of all potential interested parties. Some will focus more on organizational issues and concerns - in principle, most will be interviewed and receive a copy of the final draft as a matter of courtesy. The others, we believe, will wish to be more actively involved, and will be asked to review draft materials, at agreed intervals, for content, consistency and usability. <BR>The RETCO formal review process will be used for this activity. <BR><B>Outline Content of the ITA Definition Report</B> <BR>A skeleton ITA definition report is included as Appendix C of this document. <BR><B><I>Further Actions</I></B> <BR>A kick-off meeting for the main TA Definition Project has been arranged for the 13th September. The following activities need to have been discussed and agreed before this date: 
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Review of this plan, with discussions/agreement</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>RETCO resourcing of the project</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Agreement to the overall sponsor of this project</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Agreement to funding</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Organize workroom and documentation facilities</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Agree list of reviewers</DIV></LI></UL><B><I>RETCO Outline Project Plan</I></B> <BR>This is an outline, with dates, of the main activities of the TA Definition Project. A more detailed plan will be defined once the project has been agreed and appropriate resource allocated. In practice the start and end of each phase will overlap. <BR><B>Note to Consultant: </B>The original completion dates for each activity have been left here for completeness - do not assume that the implied elapsed times will be appropriate for any other client situation. You should read the guidance on estimating and sizing, to assess your specific client requirements, before editing these dates. <BR>You may also find it appropriate to include columns for actual activity in days (IBM and Client), plus elapsed time. <BR><B></B><BR><B>OUTLINE PLAN</B> <BR><B></B>

<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Multimedia will change the way the company does business in the future </DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>The business will drive the use of technology - the challenge for the I/T Department is to recognize technology advantages in advance and recommend appropriate uses for the business</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>The business must be responsive and dynamic to customer needs.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Expansion will be by acquisition.</DIV></LI></UL>
<P><B>Business Systems - perceived drivers and obstacles</B> <BR>Summarized from discussions held prior to and during the planning workshops </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>The business needs to reduce the time taken to get a product from the source of supply, to being available for use. The main technical obstacle here is the current I/T 'end of day processing' (batch)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Improve customer service and customer perception of service - moving to a 24/7 operational requirement - everything has to be designed to be capable of 24 hour operation (architectural requirement)</DIV></LI></UL>
<P>Potential for PC environment and the Internet to be used more effectively to support the business. Whilst the network is not an inhibitor to business growth, the weak link is the differing platform networking facilities. <BR>Key considerations:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>- control of data (central business data, vs local data) and potential proliferation of copies <BR>- access to data by users (data currently compatmentalised between systems) - requires a level of data sharing - batch updates and copies of data should be shared between systems <BR>- have some small groups of users who do their own thing.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
