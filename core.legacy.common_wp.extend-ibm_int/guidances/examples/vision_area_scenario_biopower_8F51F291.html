    An area that could use significant productivity improvement is power.&nbsp; Power generation, storage and transmission
    have not seen the breakthroughs that other technologies have since electricity was first introduced on a large scale in
    the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&nbsp; We are still generating, storing and transmitting power much like we did
    in the 1920s.&nbsp; Might the promising technologies in the biological world contribute to breakthroughs in power
    generation and transmission?&nbsp; This scenario tells that story…
</p>
<p>
    It was clear that the Achilles heel of the high energy society was the relative inefficiency of storing and
    transporting power.&nbsp; Energy was stored in fossil fuels for transportation and local power generation (generators)
    or transmitted directly from centralized generation stations through long distance transmission lines.&nbsp; Neither
    was world class efficient.&nbsp; Petroleum had an energy density far beyond any other liquid or gas fuel, and
    electricity could be used directly in a myriad of devices and machines.&nbsp; The problem with both, however, was
    getting the fuel or the power to their point of application.&nbsp; A vast array of tankers, trucks and pipelines
    distributed crude oil and its derivatives around the world, but at significant cost, both in dollars and in the energy
    required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct transmission of electricity was even worse.&nbsp; A considerable fraction of the
    electricity generated was lost transmitting it over long distances.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The solution clearly had to be in the ability to generate and store power locally rather than pay the enormous cost of
    transporting liquid fuel and electrical energy over long distances.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Might the new increasingly sophisticated biotechnologies be designed to produce energy locally?&nbsp; Human and animal
    metabolisms transform food into sugar and waste. Sugar is oxidized to produce the energy necessary to do work (via
    muscle contractions) and maintain body temperature. The process is ok for mobility but extremely inefficient at the
    production of electrical energy.
</p>
<p>
    Natural biological systems are robust, but inefficient because they must contend with innumerable challenges to their
    sustainability.&nbsp; The first step, therefore, was to find a living organism that produced relatively large amounts
    of energy bearing fuel and then “reduce” its workload by placing it in a protected environment and turning off the
    genetic instructions that would no longer be necessary.&nbsp; Lichen, a combination of algae and fungus, turned out to
    be the ideal candidate—simple, easy to grow although it had still a relatively low energy efficiency of 3.5%.
</p>
<p>
    Through genetic manipulation, however, the efficiency was raised dramatically over 10 years, to a level that began to
    be competitive with transported energy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The metherator was able to produce methane from in situ resources (primarily organic matter and human waste) using a
    combination of photosynthetic and other plant metabolic processes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Still two problems had to be overcome.&nbsp; One was the nature of the input.&nbsp; Each species of lichen was suited
    to one type of input, but this reactor needed to be able to use a wide range of inputs to be useful in most
    locations.&nbsp; Therefore, precursor microorganisms had to be designed to first break down the original material into
    components that the lichen could efficiently use.&nbsp; Finding the right combination of precursors turned out to be a
    long process of trial and error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Once a sufficiently broad spectrum of precursors were developed, a unique activation system allowed all the precursors
    to be present at once.&nbsp; Each precursor was encapsulated in a bio material that dissolved at different RF
    frequencies.&nbsp; All the operator had to do was key in the nature of the input material and the proper precursors
    were released once their organic capsules had dissolved after being exposed to the proper frequencies.
</p>
<p>
    The other problem was waste.&nbsp; The lichen’s primary function was to break down organic matter and extract the
    hydrogen to be used in fuel cells to generate heat and electricity.&nbsp; The rest of the chemicals (carbon, nitrogen,
    potassium, calcium, etc.) had to be disposed of as well.&nbsp; Some of these could be turned into recyclable
    commodities for processing elsewhere.&nbsp; The rest were formed into benign substances and stored for later use.&nbsp;
    [Could use a little more chemistry here to make it sound credible.]
</p>
<p>
    The first commercially available and affordable metherator was the Model T of the biological age.&nbsp; First they were
    used for very high value applications like space travel (using hydroponic gardening), off shore platforms (using
    plankton), and military applications (using local vegetation).&nbsp; When the prices came down, rural homes and
    businesses adopted the technology by forming micro-grids—collectives of 10-20 units that pooled their capital and their
    waste materials to unplug themselves from the grid.&nbsp; In most cases, these local cooperatives even sold excess
    power back to the grid.&nbsp; The last central utility power plant in the U.S. had just been completed, and none were
    on order.
</p>
<p>
    Ten years later, even suburban homes could make use of a metherator by feeding it lawn clippings, leaves and even
    funneling the sewer system through it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Transmitting power over long distances was no longer
    necessary.&nbsp; Dense urban areas built their own traditional power plants operating on natural gas, which did not
    suffer the transmission losses that electricity did.&nbsp; Small and highly safe nuclear plants were also built near
    urban areas so no one was transmitting power across the grid anymore.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The biology of power generation actually created a use for waste (both liquid and solid) as cities decreased their
    contribution to landfills by 55%.&nbsp; Streams and lakes became cleaner as the urban versions extracted almost all the
    organic matter from the sewer systems in cities.&nbsp; In the end, the society was finally making use of the old
    biological adage—“One person’s (or system’s) waste was another person’s resource.”
</p>
<p>
    The most important implication, however, was the step function in the amount of energy available to the average
    person.&nbsp; Since the energy came largely from recycling their own waste materials in a highly efficient manner
    (i.e., 40% recovery), there was no longer any need to turn anything off.&nbsp; Lights burned continuously, particularly
    the new 500,000 hour bulbs, that were actually damaged if they were turned off more than a dozen times.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Homes were heated and cooled to higher and lower temperatures, and autos were plugged into the generator at
    night.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Advanced work was also proceeding on producing long-chain hydrocarbons using a special class of micro-organisms called
    P3s.&nbsp; After the relatively simple task of producing methane and then methanol, the more complex tasks of producing
    ethanol and other hydrocarbons had taken more than 15 years.&nbsp; But now commercial production was less than three
    years away.&nbsp; The new substance, organol, was closer to heating oil, gasoline, and jet fuel than crude oil
    was.&nbsp; Of course, there was no longer a need for heating oil with the abundance of electric power available, but
    automobiles and, even more so, airplanes still needed a high density, transportable fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Organol promised
    to be a renewable source of liquid fuel now that Hubert’s peak had definitely been reached.
