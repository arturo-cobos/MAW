<p>
    <strong>Proof of Concept:</strong> Plan Production, Produce Product
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Objective:<br />
    </strong> To test the hypothesis that processes relying on cell manufacturing techniques, and the related changes to
    production planning, will produce superior inventory turns, lower inventory investment, and shorten lead times - while
    not increasing the cost of manufacturing.&nbsp; The test will prove that the logistics of the planning process - timing
    of data, production of the plans, re-layout of the manufacturing floor - are worth the investment and are achievable in
    a production environment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Scope:<br />
    </strong> The test included a single product, the four-inch gate valve, and a single production facility.&nbsp; This
    product has nine parts in its bill of materials, from both inside and outside the company.&nbsp; The test will simulate
    the changing of the manufacturing techniques (from large batch to cell), and the associated changes in lot sizes and
    lead times.&nbsp; The results will allow us to measure any improvements in inventory carrying costs and direct
    manufacturing costs.
</p>
<p>
    The product being used has similar attributes to 60% of the products in production at the time of this writing. While
    each product (or group of products) will require some industrial engineering of their bill of material, routing,
    lead-time, etc., the results of the simulation can be used to do a preliminary assessment of the potential improvements
    for these products as well.
</p>
<p>
    Our other products do not match the attributes of the product being simulated.&nbsp; For these products, we would
    recommend either an additional simulation activity, or continuing the current manufacturing style.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Techniques:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The simulation was planned and executed using an automated tool, IBM ARIS Toolset. The following are some details from
    the test.&nbsp; Detailed parameter settings and data used can be found in appendix A. One product was modeled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Nine parts were set up, all with order point mechanisms
    </li>
    <li>
        Order points were set to trigger when a function of safety stock and daily consumption rate (multiplied by lead
        time) was hit
    </li>
    <li>
        Work-in-progress queues were set to 100 (cell manufacturing)
    </li>
    <li>
        Finished product lot sizes were set to 1200 (reduced because of shorter lead times)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Results:</strong>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inventory turns went from 2.3 to 21
        </li>
        <li>
            Customer orders were always filled from stock (no back-orders)
        </li>
        <li>
            Lot size reduced from 8000 to 1200
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Execution Schedule:</strong><br />
     See project master plan.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Summary:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conclusions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The cell manufacturing style can produce the benefits suggested by preliminary analysis,
    </li>
    <li>
        The planning process (order point triggering manufacturing orders based on warehouse inventory levels) can be
        achieved within the allowable time window,
    </li>
    <li>
        A plant floor re-layout, assumed by the test, will need to be in place before the full benefits of the approach can
        be accomplished.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Actions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Plan a project to re-engineer the bills, routes and lead times of the products.
    </li>
    <li>
        Plan a project to redesign the plant floor layout.
    </li>
    <li>
        Synchronize these efforts with the new computer system implementation.<br />
    </li>
