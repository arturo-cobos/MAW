<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The Company has experienced reduced sales revenue because of customer dissatisfaction with the disruption in operations caused by on-site computer repairs. The problem was traced back of supplier defects caused by inadequate supplier selection. <BR>The Company believed that the problem was due to poor training in supplier selection. The company was ready to hire a consultant to teach negotiation skills when an IBM consultant intervened to suggest the development of business priorities linked with specific skills and knowledge, and also identify other contributory causes. A recommendation was developed based on a desire to increase profits through increased repeat sales and reduced quality-related costs. <BR>The analysis showed that the problem was not due to a lack of negotiation skills in general, but was due to a combination of factors. As a result, it was clear to the Company that a general negotiation skills course would not solve the problem. As a result of the effectiveness indicators, the focus of the intervention was redefined. The new focus was on accurate calculation of the trade-off between price and quality terms and a better understanding of the “total cost of quality.” <BR><?xml:namespace prefix = w /><w:wrap type="topAndBottom"></w:wrap><BR clear=all>The XYZ Company Causal Chain for the project management situation is presented below.
