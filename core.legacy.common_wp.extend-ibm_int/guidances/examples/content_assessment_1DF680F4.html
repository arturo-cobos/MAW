            <u>Information Architecture Summary</u> - Note: this is an assessment of the current information architecture,
            which may or may not be structured in an effective manner for e-Business and transformation. For example,
            current information might be categorized by product, where the e-business need might require categorization by
            specific audience. In some cases, the finding may be that the Information Architecture is “accidental,” as
            opposed to designed. If so, and particularly if there are no surveys or studies available to assess current
            site effectiveness, then the Information Architecture should be evaluated.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>Information architecture is not new, but is emerging as a web-specific discipline. Quite simply, it focuses organizing
information so users can satisfy their information or content needs. In many cases, existing “Information Architectures”
are either “accidental” or “legacy architectures. The classification, indexing, etc. may have been assigned simply because
that was how the information was presented or identified; or, it may be a legacy from the previous publishing format, e.g.,
the indices on the web map directly to a previous hard-copy publication’s indices as “Back Matter.” (“Back Matter” is
information routinely found in the back of publications – glossaries, indices, cross-references, etc.)<br />
The emerging Information Architecture discipline encompasses investigation, analysis, design and implementation, and may be
approached from the “Bottom-up” (which is based on a deep understanding of available content, its attributes, relationships
and uses); or from the “Top-Down” (which is based on the context in which a user requires the content.) In general, this
methodology is a “Top-Down” approach; however, this content assessment is critical to establish that there is either: a) an
adequate ‘Bottom-up” foundation of Information Architecture to support and sustain our efforts or b) resources and skills
available to create an adequate Information Architecture to support (at least) our specific efforts and enable us to
achieve our objectives.<br />
Information Architecture establishes the foundation for usable and user-acceptable systems, and is based on knowledge and
methods that are not only multi-disciplinary, but are also typically beyond skills available in the average IT development
organization. The disciplines that are involved include: Interaction, Task Analysis, User Cognition, Organizational and
Social Impacts of Technology, User Centered Design, Usability, Education and Communication. <br />
- <u>Overall content topology</u> – Identifies current content base as being oriented by “breadth,” “depth,” or some
combination of the two (usually on a business unit-unit basis). The degree of content breadth and depth that is required
will directly affect the skills, time, and complexity of integration and/or implementation. As a rule of thumb, integrating
independently developed, extremely deep content “wells” is significantly more complex and expensive than linking shallower
content “ponds or puddles.” <br />
The depth of content is typically not consistent across the breadth of the content base; typically, some areas will have
great depth, and others will have varying degrees of maturity and development. These may be a reflection of a recent merger
or acquisition; differences in staffing or funding; historical business focus(es); differing business models, measurements,
objectives or rules for separate business units; or, an overall planned implementation by phases/focus. <br />
A key to driving direct, rapid business results is to establish and maintain a focus on <b>only</b> the high-value customer
facing information initially. The challenge is that the customer may be unable to differentiate between what is “necessary
and sufficient,” vs. what is “available.” <br />
- <u>Navigation</u> – may also be called browsing, contextual browsing, hierarchical browsing, searching, supplemental
browsing, guide, index, etc. It is a direct reflection of the underlying classification and labeling plans. <br />
It occurs on multiple levels, and describes how a user may retrieve specific content. Current navigation methods tend to
reflect existing information access patterns, but new navigational constructs will continue to emerge as our understanding
of the e-environment, usability and effectiveness deepens. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Global navigation – is usually common at a site level, is available consistently across all progeny or sibling
            sites. Examples abound, usually as tabs or buttons across a site masthead.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Hierarchical navigation– is the path that the user is <i>expected</i> to follow through a site to access
            content, and it is highly task (and therefore results) oriented. It may alternatively be called the ‘Site
            directory, taxonomy, ontology.” Hierarchical navigation directly reflects content grouping and organization.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>It is extremely important, if the primary navigation of a site is hierarchical (in other words, there are limited
alternate paths to the content), to determine whether there was customer involvement in the design and implementation. If
there has not been, then the recommendations should include user studies of the current interface/construct. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Contextual navigation – offers one alternate path to content, and is usually entered once a user has identified
            at least one piece of content of interest, either via a search, or other path. The context may be synonymous,
            or similar material; or, it may be complementary, or related material.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>This is frequently visible on a web site as a function called “Show me more like this,” or “See also…” or “See
Related…” <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Supplemental navigation – offers alternate paths to content , and may be specialized by audience segment. These
            paths include Site Maps, Indexes, Tables of Content, and audience specific guides.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>Some of these are analogous to supplemental navigation aids that are commonly found in printed materials (particularly
textbooks). For example, chapters may begin with a visual chapter overview or outline (map); they include both a Table of
Contents, and at least one “Back Matter” Index by topic or keyword; they may include a Figure list, a Summary page or
section at the end of each chapter, and alternate indices in the “Back Matter,” by author, date, or some other significant
grouping.<br />
They all serve to provide alternate paths to the content that may be more efficient for the user. However, the
effectiveness and user-focused web-appropriate designs for supplemental navigation aids is clearly just emerging. <br />
- <u>Classification and labeling</u> – may also be called grouping , organizing, indexing, schema’s, etc. and is frequently
confused with hierarchical navigation. It reflects the attributes and relationship of content elements, in a collection
that is understandable by the user and which supports business needs. <br />
Examples of classification include: alphabetical, chronological, geographical, topical, task-oriented, audience-oriented.
Indexing or labeling may be automated, based on content value, or it may be manual, based on expert contextual evaluation.
These methods of grouping or classification can be reflected in site navigation, although investigation of the
effectiveness of these constructs, for specific types of contents, audiences and tasks in the web environment is ongoing.
<br />
Integral to successful e-environment classification is the development of a common vocabulary, consistent labeling of
content, as well as indices which establish cross-references between the labels. Thesauri enable users to access content
across classification and navigation constructs via definition of content relationships: hierarchical (parent-progeny),
associative (e.g. related or similar), or equivalent (synonymous). <br />
- Style definition, standards and templates – may be referred to by a wide range of labels, ranging from very
technology-specific terms such as “DTD’s” to very general terms such as page, document, section, subsection, or document
type, layout, structure, format, fragment, or element, etc. <br />
Lack of a common lexicon for these associated style definitions can result in confusion, and extended discovery periods if
not resolved early in the assessment period. <br />
Style definitions, standards & templates are established externally to the actual content, and define the presentation
look & feel of every content entity that is presented. These styles are merged with the content at the point of
publication, and result in a consistent look & feel in delivered content. <br />
Examples of specific formats could include News Release, News Brief, Product Information, Technical Specifications, Catalog
Pages, Order Confirmation, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s), Hints and Tips (HaT’s), etc. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Data Base / Content Repository Summary
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>- Overall content format topology summary – establishes the breadth and depth of the physical content environment.
Significant content percentages in multiple legacy formats will directly affect content readiness assessment, and has
direct implications for both resource needs and projected schedule. <br />
If there is a significant volume or percentage of Legacy content <b>is required</b> (e.g., hard-coded content only
accessible at a document level, such as hard-coded HTML documents in a Lotus Notes &trade; database), then an entire segment of
tasks and activities must be included in the Readiness Assessment project plan. This must address selection, Transcoding
and/or conversion, automated vs. manual “scraping,” and indexing. <br />
Careful investigation is recommended to identify legacy content that is “required” vs. “available” in order to correctly
assess its scope and impact on overall readiness. High percentages of legacy content needs may be mitigated by phasing in
availability over time, as appropriate in support of the business objectives. <br />
The overall content format topology summary should identify: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Overall approximate volume of content, broken down by estimates of Strategic, Tactical, Legacy and Supporting
            pages or percentages.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The number and types of legacy content affected
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Percentages of legacy formats, by legacy types (e.g., hard-coded HTML documents, Host or Mainframe formats,
            data bases by data base type, etc.)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Percentage available in dynamic format, with available supporting style libraries (includes standards, style
            sheets, templates)
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>- Identification of current content repositories/sources (The “Blueprint”) 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Repository name, purpose, owner
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Repository status (Strategic, Tactical, Legacy, Supporting)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Repository format (DB2, Notes, Oracle, HTML, etc.)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Repository size, change rate (frequency, percent), growth rate (percent, time interval)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Repository control (security), access and performance considerations
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Repository indices (views) available
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Current Review frequency (last review, next and future scheduled reviews)
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>- Identification of individual content repository contents (Data Dictionary) 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Content Category/Element (example, Product Description, Catolog entry)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Actual field name, description, length, format (text, numeric, etc.) allowed values
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Field required (Y/N) or restricted (referenced values:business rules)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Defined field attributes, indexing parameters, relationships
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>- Identification of Strategic repositories, technologies, tools and their status 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Is there an agreed upon “Common Vocabulary” that is available to establish the context for this review and
            discussion?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>The “Common Vocabulary” is developed as part of the overall Information architecture, and establishes the working
definitions and terms that will enable discussions and progress to be made without the risks of semantic confusion. This is
critical in the emerging web and e-environment.<br />
For example, the following terms should all have commonly agreed upon definitions: Strategic, Legacy, Tactical, Portal,
Site, Page, Section, sub-section, content element, content description, document, meta-data, format, style, template,
attribute, relationship, entity, repository, data base, access, security, navigation, hierarchy, browsing, searching,
profile, personalization, etc. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Where will the definitive versions of the content be created, stored, maintained?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>For example: There will be one Customer Information (CI) data base to contain all customer specific information; there
will be one Product Information (PI) data base to store all product specific information; there will be one Support
Information (SI) data base to store all support specific, experiential information such as FAQ’s, Hints & Tips, Case
Studies, etc.; there will be one Contract Entitlement (CE) Data Base to contain all contract information for entitlement
purposes 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            What indices or constructs will be used to provide scalable access to this content?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>For example, the Contract Entitlement database will be cross-referenced to the CI database via the following specific
fields: Customer name, Customer number, etc. The primary database will be replicated in x locations at x intervals to
provide adequate response time globally. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The technologies, down to a version level, should be called out.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>For example: All strategic DB’s will be DB2, Ver. X, Rel., Y, running in the xyz operating environment. Content will
be XML tagged, using the Style sheets as defined in x., etc. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Tools to be used to support these repositories should be identified down to a version level, and called out.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>For example, All data dictionaries will be created and maintained using product abc, Ver. X, Rel Y, running in the xyz
environment. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The status of these repositories should be explicitly identified.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>For example: the CI data base is in production and available for access; the PI database is designed, and in test with
dummy data; three repositories must be transcoded and merged into the PI database, and the schedules for each are abc. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <u>Readiness Summary</u> - should recap the analysis and finding of the data gathering effort represented
            above, highlighting issues and recommendations to resolve those issues. Care must be taken not to “boil the
            ocean,” but to collect adequate information to enable a specific engagement to proceed to desired customer
            results.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            “Top Sheet” – summary of the business need, proposed solution; Issues, Dependencies & Risks; Target
