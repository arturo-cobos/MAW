    Remember the days when you used to receive tickets, maps, instructions, and reservation confirmations as a package of
    pieces of paper from your tour packager? Now everything is electronic (including your passport) and all you receive is
    a cell phone. I am a customer service representative for Round-the-World Tours and my job has gotten much easier with
    almost 100% adoption of our new cell phone based tour service management by all our service vendors.
</p>
<p>
    I’m sure you will not be surprised to learn that I work from my home in India. When a client signs up for a
    Round-the-World tour via our automated web or phone service, I am not even in the loop. But often a client wishes to
    contact a real live human, and our automated systems simply don’t anticipate all requirements. In any case, the client
    receives, by express mail, a preprogrammed special loaner cell phone. I am available to assist the client in learning
    to use the cell phone. I am also available to deal with late arrival of the phone, phone failure, loss of the phone,
    assistance in call forwarding to the phone, and last minute changes in itinerary. Most of these things could be handled
    by our automated systems; but in stressful situations, people prefer not to have to think about how to navigate an
    automated system. Instead, they fall back on human-human connection. Cut rate operators who offer only automated
    services quickly find out that, after the first glitch, there is almost no repeat business.
</p>
<p>
    Our phone is the next best thing to a personal tour guide and assistant. If you are traveling in a family group, it has
    a walkie-talkie feature that allows instant communication up to about half a mile. And, it has a speed dial connection
    to me.
</p>
<p>
    When I am not needed, here is the expected sequence of events. You receive your phone. The printed instructions tell
    you to dial the automated tour guide number. Calling this number synchronizes your phone with our system and let’s us
    know that our service delivery has begun. The phone is a full service cell phone that works everywhere in the world.
    You may optionally, at any time, forward all your calls to it and use it as your personal cell phone. (Isn’t it great
    that there are universal cell phone battery chargers now? We don’t have to send you a special purpose charger as well
    as the new phone. I don’t think we would have developed this system without universal chargers.)
</p>
<p>
    A few days before your tour is scheduled to begin, you receive a recorded reminder in both voice and text modes. If the
    GPS locator in your phone detects that you are not moving toward your embarkation point at a rate that will get you
    there reasonably on time, you receive warning messages. If our system determines that you will miss the embarkation, we
    reschedule with a best fit. I receive lots of calls from people who have arrived at their embarkation point, only to
    discover that they have lost or left behind the needed cell phone. Not to worry – replacements are immediately
    available. We anticipated the problem when we detected that the cell phone would not reach the embarkation point on
    time and that our calls to you were not being answered. That kind of service is why you picked Round-the World Tours.
</p>
<p>
    Security is no longer an issue and trusted transactions can be done from your phone with simple to use technology.
</p>
<p>
    Your phone provides you with travel directions to reach the tour embarkation point and during any personal side tour.
    We encourage you to use it because it helps us anticipate your other needs. When you reach a public carrier or hotel,
    the phone serves as your reservation, electronic ticket, and almost universally accepted credit card. Since vendors
    have varying levels of technology for electronic commerce, your phone contains three separate systems, at least one of
    which is extremely likely to be recognized by any given vendor.
</p>
<p>
    One really nice service that works at all the big hotel chains is <b>just in time check-in</b>. This service runs an
    automated check-in protocol as you near your destination. Your phone gives you your room number and directions to find
    it. Better yet, it arranges for various amenities in the room to be started at appropriate times so that the room is
    completely ready for your occupation without any energy having been wasted. Booking meals is almost as simple.
</p>
<p>
    Now that you’ve arrived at your destination and checked in, the fun begins. Your itinerary is conveniently loaded into
    your phone and simple icon menu driven selections allow you to pull it up and start your tour. Today you are scheduled
    to visit the Chartres Cathedral just South of Paris. After reviewing your itinerary and making some last minute
    selections, you’re on your way.
</p><br />
<br />
<p>
    A taxi is waiting outside to take you to the train. Your electronic train tickets are already loaded into your phone.
    The taxi fare is sent directly to your phone over a Bluetooth link. You accept it and it’s automatically paid for as
    you leave for the train station. Your phone points the direction you need to walk to get into the train station. As you
    enter, the screen continues to suggest the route to the departure gate. You wave your phone over the gate, it opens and
    you embark.
</p>
<p>
    As you leave the train station, your phone guides you through town to Chartres Cathedral. This is your first visit to
    this historic Church and you want to learn as well as tour. Your phone is there to help. Its GPS system senses your
    exact location. As you point your phone (camera) at any object, you see it as if you were taking a still picture but
    with text labels popping up to describe it. The phone recognizes and faintly outlines architectural objects of
    importance, from flying buttresses to the individual statues, labyrinth floor, and stained glass windows. If you want
    to know more you select the text label and another menu opens up that allows you to access its history.
</p>
<p>
    As you walk, your path is recorded. Your visual observations are uploaded to your web site so you can watch them when
    you return to your room.
</p>
<p>
    On your trip back you’re contently looking out of the train and notice a building you know is famous but can’t quite
    identify. You simply point your phone’s camera at it and ask, "what building is this?" Fortunately your camera knows
    where you are and has access to huge libraries of data and photographs from around the world. It quickly identifies
    each scene.
</p>
<p>
    We are just testing deployment of biometric authentication phones that stop working and send distress signals if they
    are out of your possession. These phones also sense a few important medical conditions (like fever) and can be set to
    alert you or to send such alerts to me.
</p>
<p>
    My job will be even easier when your standard cell phone already has all the devices we use so it can be remotely
    programmed to act the way our loaner phones now work. The whole transaction system will be even simpler when the next
    generation intelligent wireless communication devices are standard for both your phone and every vender cash register.
    We know this next generation system is coming. The standards have already been adopted world-wide and almost all
    governments have allocated the appropriate operating frequency bands. But the current RFID systems are working well
    now. Our vendors need an incentive to invest in the change. We don’t know when the change will actually take place; but
    I’m looking forward to it. I’m not worried that the new automation will result in no need for me. There will always be
    glitches and CSRs will always be needed to respond to you and fix the problem.
