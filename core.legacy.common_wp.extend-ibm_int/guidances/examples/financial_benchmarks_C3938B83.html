    For every client and its competitors, the team needs to compute a set of generic and industry-specific ratios during
    the proposal or initialization phases.
</p>
<p>
    These ratios should be used in at least three critical ways: 1) to Analyze Trends, 2) to Assess competitiveness and 3)
    to provide the basis for preliminary problem diagnosis and engagement planning.
</p>
<p>
    Data for these analyses are generally available from public sources like SEC 10-K/10-Q filings, industry associations,
    and 3rd party databases.
</p>
<p>
    Further insights and explanations can often be gained from reviewing the trade press and interviewing client executives
    and industry experts.<br clear="all" />
    <br />
    Below is a simple example of assessing Competitive Gaps & Implications.

                While trend analysis for the client's business is important, it is often difficult to interpret until we
                benchmark the client’s trends against those of its competitors

    <br />
    In addition to a few generic ratios (such as Return on Equity or EBIT/Sales) each industry will have its own
    industry-specific ratios designed to assess key operating factors that determine success in that industry.
</p>
<p>
    This Trend Chart illustrates the benchmarking of our client (Bank A) versus its competitors on four different banking
    industry ratios:
</p>
<p>
    <img style="WIDTH: 627px; HEIGHT: 479px" height="479" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finbenex1.JPG" width="600" /><br />
    <br />
    First, we see that Bank A has been inconsistent in terms of ROA. Furthermore, in five years, it has gone from best to
    worst among the peers shown. This should raise a "red flag" for the team, encouraging a more complete analysis of the
    underlying drivers of ROA.
</p>
<p>
    The second chart compares Bank A's risk-based capital to the standards set for the industry by the Federal Reserve. It
    indicates that Bank A has been more cautious than the Federal Reserve standard. The team should inquire as to the
    rationale for this “prudence,” as it may be related to the relatively poor ROA.
</p>
<p>
    Bank A's "fee income" has been consistently in the middle of the pack over the five-year period. The team would
    probably see this as indicating an area with few urgent problems.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, its loan loss ratio has expanded along with its peers. While this may not indicate a problem specifically
    for Bank A, the team should determine whether the whole industry is experiencing a serious loan-loss problem that could
    represent a threat or opportunity for Bank A.
</p>
<p>
    <img style="WIDTH: 593px; HEIGHT: 376px" height="372" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finbenex2.JPG" width="588" /><br />
    <br />
    Often, it is useful to present the relative Financial Benchmarks of several competitors on a two-dimensional
    "Competitive Map” like the one shown above.
</p>
<p>
    This can powerfully illustrate competitive advantages or problems. For example, we see in this example that
    Northwestern Mutual is far ahead its peer group in terms of employee productivity. Moreover, we see that, not only are
    it's agents far more effective in generating revenue, but that it has a clear operating efficiency advantage when
    compared to Metropolitan (the other strong revenue generator).
</p>
<p>
    If our client was John Hancock, we could interpret this to mean that “we should not only focus on learning how
    Northwestern generates higher revenues per employee but how it sustains its gross income per employee advantage
    relative to the whole industry.”<br />
    This Comparative Economic Structure Chart (taken from an actual engagement report) is a very powerful tool for showing
    how our client
</p>
<p>
    <img style="WIDTH: 649px; HEIGHT: 493px" height="490" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finbenex3.JPG" width="600" /><br />
    <br />
    (Company A) stacks up versus a competitor (Company B) in terms of critical ratios and how these ratios are related to
    the market strategy employed by the competitor.
</p>
<p>
    Both of these companies are large US discount retail chains. All of the financial data was taken from SEC filings.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see the Pre-Tax ROI of Company B is nearly twice that of Company A; an enormous competitive gap in such a
    mature industry. As this presentation reveals, part of the ROI advantage comes from B's strong EBIT. Looking further to
    the right, we see that B actually has lower gross margins than A (indicating lower selling prices or higher purchasing
    costs). However, this is more than made up for by B's dramatically lower operating expenses.
</p>
<p>
    This analysis directs us to explore hypotheses about the source of this operating cost advantage and ways to close the
    gap. A quick look at B's operating strategy shows "Low Assortment Breadth," "High Emphasis on Supplier Partnerships"
    and "High Priority on Demographic Focus". This means B likely emphasizes supply chain management to reduce costs and
    product mix simplification to minimize the cost of complexity.
</p>
<p>
    The other source of B's extraordinary ROI is its low asset investment as a % of sales. If we look at the three classes
    of assets, we see that B actually has a higher % of sales invested in fixed assets, like stores and distribution
    centers, than does A. However, both inventory and working capital are substantially lower for B. This leads us back to
    an examination of B's supply chain management approach as documented in the trade press and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
    <img style="WIDTH: 596px; HEIGHT: 354px" height="355" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/examples/resources/finbenex4.JPG" width="583" /><br />
    <br />
    Although this assessment involved a retailer, this form of presentation works well for any industry.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to highlighting specific competitive characteristics of industry participants, Financial Benchmarks can
    often tell us how the industry structure is changing.
</p>
<p>
    For example, these two Trend Charts describe the fictional "Alphabet Industry." The chart on the left shows that the
    industry is both growing and heading for consolidation. Because of overall industry growth, the smaller competitors may
    still be making acceptable returns.
</p>
<p>
    However, the smaller players are falling behind the larger firms. This implies that when growth slows, the “big three”
    are likely to squeeze the smaller firms out using whatever advantage has enabled hem to grow more rapidly than the
    rest.
</p>
<p>
    The chart on the right paints an even more ominous picture: even among the top three firms, XYZ is experiencing
    negative growth. DEF and ABC seem to be setting themselves us to be a duopoly.
</p>
<p>
    How this plays itself out (and how our client should respond) depends on the underlying economics of the industry.
