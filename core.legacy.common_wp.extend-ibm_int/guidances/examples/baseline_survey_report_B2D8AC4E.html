    This example assumes that the same project team originally developed the application system being supported. The
    project team is now broadly divided into a development sub-group who focus on enhancements and new functionality, and a
    maintenance sub-group who focus on corrections and production support. The project team has recently undergone
    substantial staff turnover and about half of the team members are relatively new. In addition, the application was
    developed using a localized approach therefore its deliverables do not neatly fit into the IBM work products.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the Baseline Survey Report is about discovering and reporting on the state of the relevant areas of the
    application system that are likely to be affected.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Scope</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The requirements suggest a need to survey the following areas of the system. Note that the system is categorized to
    align with the development process.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        System context
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Logical design components
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Physical design components
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Operating processes and procedures
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Training and support materials
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The survey does not include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        IT Standards because they only form the minimum practice requirements. They will be extended wherever there is a
        need
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Operating environment because the requirements do not prompt any changes
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

    <strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>System context</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The application provides telecommunication services activation functionality that supports the business processes of
    rapidly connecting customers to the company’s network and also providing them with network services and rental
    equipment. Refer to System Description for an elaborate account.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Requirements context</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The project team has received a set of client requirements summarized below which has been bundled into one release.
    Refer to the Client Request Package for requirements detail.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reduce the current elapse time between service activation completion and network usage recognition from two days to
        2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Correct the display of customer credit check warnings to ‘red and flashing’ on the screen instead of the
            current ‘black and no flash’.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Introduce the following two new service products (call number display and ‘red eye’ special rates for off peak
            network usage) to the application’s capability.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION SURVEY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The deliverables, although not IBM work products, generally represent the expected output of the IBM work products.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Conceptual System Design document provides an overview, which describes the purpose of the system, and how it
        supports the business. This provides a useful introduction to the circumstances that guided the development of the
        application.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Logical System Design document defines the logical composition of the application into functions rather
            than business process steps, however it is heavily data focused. It consists of a number of diagrams with very
            little text to explain them; therefore it is difficult to follow.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Program module specifications exist, however they are out of date.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            There is a limited set of operating processes and procedures, perhaps due to the lack of an application
            turnover package and the fact that the same project team developed and supports the application. New operating
            procedures to reflect the operational changes that the solution is likely to effect will have to be developed
            from scratch.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Training and support materials are not updated. Release notes are sent to inform users of new changes therefore
            the base documentation may be an unreliable source to target.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>SYSTEM FUNCTIONS SURVEY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Logical System Design document shows that the following functional areas are likely to be relevant to this release:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Service status update
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Service completion
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Interface to Billing
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Product availability
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Service order entry will not be affected because the processes and data will remain the same. All other areas are
    similarly unaffected.<br />
    Up-to-date comments exist in the application source code; however, they vary considerably in their descriptiveness and
    elegance of structure. Comparatively, the billing interface programs are well structured and are relatively easy to
    follow. Product availability also has shorter programs and relatively simple algorithms.<br />
    With respect to requirement 2, there is no documentation that facilitates the location of affected screens. Therefore,
    each screen will need to be examined individually.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Business processes can be deduced from the logical models but it is difficult to know which controls have been
    incorporated.<br />
    The logical level documentation is considered incomplete, because of the lack of process documentation at this level.
    The project team would need supplementary information to facilitate the design decisions they will have to make in
    satisfying the requirements.<br />
    Extra care should be taken when analyzing the service creation status at which to trigger the billing interface because
    of the insufficient and out-of-date documentation as well as the complex algorithms present in the associated
    programs.<br />
