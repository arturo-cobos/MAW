    <strong>Purpose:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To describe the systematic audit of the IEC Quality Management System in order to verify the System's effectiveness
        and on-going compliance with the requirements of ISO9001: 1994.
    </li>

        To ensure that corrective and preventive actions are brought to the attention of the management team.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Responsibilities:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    All managers
</p>
<p>
    Quality System Management Representative
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Actions:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preparation of the Internal Audit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Internal Quality Auditors
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Quality System Management Representative (QSMR) is responsible for ensuring that adequate numbers of trained
        auditors are available. A list of trained auditors is maintained in appendix A.
    </li>
    <li>
        All auditors are trained by formal internal quality auditor education. They must be able to provide evidence of
        adequate training (see document IEC ISO 9000 assessor job description).
    </li>
    <li>
        Auditors must not audit areas for which they have a direct responsibility.
    </li>
    <li>
        The QMSR may decide to invite auditors from outside the IEC organization. These auditors should appear in their
        country on the list of approved auditors.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Planning Internal Quality Audits
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        With a combination of internal and external audits, all departments will be audited a minimum of once every 12
        months.
    </li>
    <li>
        An annual audit plan is maintained by the QSMR. This can be viewed on QMX.
    </li>
    <li>
        When planning the internal audit schedule consideration needs to be given to any planned external audits.
    </li>
    <li>
        The QSMR schedules auditors in accordance with the audit schedule. If more than one auditor is appointed, the QSMR
        identifies the lead auditor. The (lead) auditor agrees on the exact date of the audit together with the IEC Quality
        Coordinator and the auditee.
    </li>
    <li>
        The IEC Quality Coordinator is responsible for the coordination of the audit. The ISO department coordinator will
        act as a guide for his department.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Pre-Audit
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the audit, the auditor may request early access to the organization diagram and any other quality
    documentation that is relevant to the department(s) audited.
</p>
<p>
    The Auditee
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The auditee is the manager of the department that is being audited. The manager may appoint a deputy to take over
        this role.
    </li>
    <li>
        The auditee must be able to explain all what happens in his area of responsibilities or guide the auditor to the
        right persons who can answer specific questions.
    </li>
    <li>
        The auditee stays with the auditor during the entire audit and is authorized to verify the observations together
        with the auditor and to sign the report in the name of the audited department.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Material/process to be audited
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All policies, processes, documents, records, plans, programs, measurements, instructions, standards, and any other
        material that relates to efficient and effective operation of the QMS may be subject of review.
    </li>
    <li>
        The auditor determines the subjects to be audited, possibly in deliberation with the IEC Quality Manager, based
        upon the type and importance of the activities of the department.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Execution of the Audit</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It is necessary that the auditor can move around freely in the department where the audit is conducted.
    </li>
    <li>
        If during the audit observations are made, the auditor uses an Observation form to record them (form IECASSF held
        by IEC Quality Coordinator). A separate Observation form is used for each observation.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the Observation form is filled out, the auditee and the auditor at the end of the department audit sign it.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Observations, nonconformityâ€™s and remarks
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        After the quality audit is completed the Observation forms are discussed with the auditee to determine whether a
        specific OBSERVATION is a NONCONFORMITY of ISO 9001 or a REMARK. (NONCONFORMITY means that the standard requirement
        has NOT been met. A REMARK means that in principle the standard requirement has been met but that the item needs
        improvement or elucidation.)
    </li>
    <li>
        If there is agreement on the fact that a non-conformity/remark has occurred, this will be noted on the Observation
        form, together with the relevant paragraph of ISO 9001.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    NOTE: At any moment during the above the nonconformity/remark can be contested on the basis of new facts, different
    interpretation, etc. The auditor supplies the final verdict regarding the status of observation or
    nonconformity/remark. If no consensus is reached, normal line management escalation takes effect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conclusion of the audit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Audit Report
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        After the quality audit a quality audit report is created. The report is sent to the IEC Quality Coordinator, who
        makes copies for all department managers involved in the audit.
    </li>
    <li>
        The quality audit report contains at least the following sections:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Assessment schedule
            </li>
            <li>
                Assessment Team
            </li>
            <li>
                Observation forms
            </li>
            <li>
                Summary Nonconformity Matrix
            </li>
            <li>
                Clause Coverage Matrix
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The IEC Quality Coordinator keeps original forms.
</p>
<p>
    Corrective and Preventive action
</p>
<p>
    The complete set of Observation forms is discussed during the first weekly Management Review meeting after the audit.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The manager of the audit department documents the corrective actions or action plans on the observation form.
    </li>
    <li>
        Within 14 days after the audit, a copy of completed Observation form is sent back to the IEC Quality Coordinator.
    </li>
    <li>
        The IEC Quality Coordinator checks action plans/Corrective actions for completeness. Missing Observation forms or
        overdue plans/actions are discussed in the weekly Management Review meeting.
    </li>
    <li>
        When corrective action has been taken, this is noted by the department coordinator on the Observation form, a copy
        has to be sent to the IEC Quality Coordinator.<br />
