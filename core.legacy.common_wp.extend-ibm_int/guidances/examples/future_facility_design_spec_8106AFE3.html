    <strong>Building Structure</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The building steel structure would be designed for a three (3) story building, with the third floor as a future
    option.&nbsp; The finished floor to ceiling height would be approximately thirteen (13) feet allowing for 9’-0” height
    ceiling, 2’-0” for structure, and 2’-0” for distribution of mechanical/electrical systems.
</p>
<p>
    The lower floor’s structural slab would be designed for 100 psf live load throughout.&nbsp; This is to support the
    raised computer floor area and mechanical systems located on the lower floor.&nbsp; The lower floor slab would also be
    depressed at the raised floor so that the computer flooring would be at the same elevation as the balance of the floor
    which eliminates the need for ramps or steps into the computer room.&nbsp; The entire concrete floor slab and the
    concrete walls for the data center should have a sealer applied to prevent dusting and moisture and water vapor
    penetration.&nbsp; Any gaps at construction or expansion joints caused by differential settlement of the floor should
    be cleaned and resealed with new sealant.&nbsp; The upper floor would be a concrete slab designed for 75 psf live load
    for primary office space and conference functions.&nbsp; The roof of the building would be a structural slab designed
    for 100 psf live load.&nbsp; The roof slab would be flat with a waterproof membrane roof and tapered insulation to
    create roof pitched for drainage.&nbsp; This slab would be used as the third story if long term requirements change.
</p>
<p>
    The foundation walls and exterior walls above grade to be +/- 12” thick reinforced concrete.&nbsp; A perimeter drainage
    system would be required to remove water from the building perimeter, design to be based on a geological survey.&nbsp;
    The interior walls at the stair, elevator, and computer room would also be reinforced concrete.&nbsp; The exterior
    facade would be of metal sandwich panels applied to the concrete structural wall. A ribbon of windows may be included
    in the office areas on the east facade of the building.&nbsp; These windows would be 1” laminated glass in fixed steel
    frames.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    All pedestrian entries into the data center building would be at grade with extra heavy duty steel doors and
    frames.&nbsp; Sidewalks sloping away from the building will allow for handicap access.&nbsp; IBM also recommends that a
    breezeway be installed to connect the new data center building to the main building.&nbsp; There would be a separate
    exterior entrance to the breezeway to allow entrance to the data center building and/or the main
    building.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The existing covered windows at the existing computer room on the north facade of the main building should have the
    temporary sheet metal covers removed and windows restored as required to allow natural light into the former data
    center and relocated mail room area.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>General Construction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Fire-rated resistive and tornado resistive construction, including partition assemblies, door assemblies, hardware
    sets, and ductwork fire dampers should be used to protect the perimeter of the data center as well as to
    compartmentalize it internally as currently the practice.&nbsp; Minimum recommended fire ratings used in most data
    center designs are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Data Center perimeter (concrete) - 2 hour
    </li>
    <li>
        Office areas - 1 hour
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Interior Partitions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The interior of the space would have gypsum board partitions either running slab-to-slab in conference and mechanical
    room areas or 6” above ceiling in office areas. A return air plenum would be created above the ceiling to allow air to
    return to the mechanical system air handlers.&nbsp; Ducted returns would be utilized in full height wall areas
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Ceiling System</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The finished ceiling should ideally have a minimum of 9 feet of clearance above the raised floor The ceiling tile
    should be a sound absorbent, vinyl-coated (vapor resistant) tile which will aid in humidity control in the data center
    space.&nbsp; Installation of the lay-in tiles should include metal hold-down clips. An airtight seal should be provided
    at all extended perimeter walls to contain fire suppression gas and minimize leakage of the controlled air-conditioned
    environment.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The ceiling above the office area and the remainder of areas in the building should have a minimum height of 9 feet of
    clearance.&nbsp; The ceiling should be standard 2x4 lay-in tile.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Raised Floor&nbsp; (Access Floor)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The raised floor will be installed as a depressed slab. This would eliminate the need for any ramps, steps, and hand
    railings.&nbsp; The 3600 square foot size of the depressed slab area should be large enough to provide for future
    expansion of the data center.&nbsp; The offices and tape library are located on the raised floor.&nbsp; These areas
    could be relocated off the raised floor in the future to provide for more space for future expansion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    An 18 inch finish floor height will provide adequate space to create an area for computer cabling within the computer
    room as well as a plenum for computer room cooling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The new raised access floor should utilize panels with steel construction with a high-pressure laminate finish and a
    concentrated point load capacity of 1,250 psi.&nbsp; The panels in high traffic areas, such as aisles or an equipment
    staging area, should have a 1,500 psi concentrated point load capacity.&nbsp; A move-in rolling load of 1,250 psi and a
    repetitive manual cart rolling load capacity of 1,000 lb. should be designed.&nbsp; All panels should be color
    coordinated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The understructure should be a system of pedestals and rigid grid of bolted stringers in a 2' x 2’ basket weave
    pattern.&nbsp; Accessories as required for a complete system installation include cable cutouts, perforated airflow
    panels, plenum dividers, vertical closures (fascia), panel lifting devices, perimeter supports and equipment
    cutouts.&nbsp; Equipment, furniture, fixtures and on-the-floor partitions should be carefully located for floor panel
    removal to facilitate access to the plenum area.
</p>
<p>
