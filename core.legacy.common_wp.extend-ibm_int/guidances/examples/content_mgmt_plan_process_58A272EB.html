        </div>
    </li>
</ul>In the above scenario, each unit has differing focuses and business models. If web-delivered content is a point of
integration that must cross these boundaries, then all units must agree on the overall objectives, audiences, measurements
of success, formats, vocabulary, etc<b>. as an integral part of web content identification and selection.</b>

            <b><i>Indexing and description</i></b> of content: Is there a common vocabulary for content, that can be
            applied to indexing and describing acquired /selected content? How are necessary indices identified, justified
            and implemented? Cross-references? Thesauri? How is this logical view of the content validated? How are these

        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>Storage and Access</i></b> of content: Who “owns” the content? What are the rights and responsibilities
            of the owner? What are the rights and responsibilities of the “users” who access and publish the content? How
            is growth and performance tracked and managed? How is content secured? Are there multiple levels of security?
            What are the policies and guidelines that govern access (permitted or entitled)?

            internally? What are the processes for requesting access to content for repurposing? How are rights to
            re-purpose verified? How are any work efforts required to repurpose initiated and executed? What additional
            maintenance and quality or data integrity processes are needed?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>(A re-purposing example: a still color photo taken at high-resolution for a printed marketing brochure, is requested
for use as part of a web campaign. This means it must be accessed, converted to multiple resolution formats (for display,
different destination display devices, printing, etc.), perhaps cropped differently, additional descriptive and/or indexing
information entered, etc.)

            devices? To what countries? Subject to what controls? How is submitted to the production environment? Tested?
            Staged? Promoted? What are the update processes (vitality?) What are the “breakage” contingency processes
            (i.e., what if the site goes down, what happens, who is called? What if the site is infected with a virus? Just
            one element?)

    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>Administration and Publishing Workflow</i></b> – What is the Publishing Workflow? The Operations
            Workflow? At what points must those workflows link to external governing reviews (i.e., Legal, Design
            Integrity, Quality, Usability etc.)? How are staffing levels, skills, hiring and education plans defined and
            implemented to support administration and content workflows? What tools are necessary to support/automate these

            projects, both long-term and short term projects.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>For example: a web project to support a new product announcement is put in place. Team needs include layout/design,
usability, technical writing, marketing writing, videography, digital art and photo editing, application links for
follow-ups, phone campaign, and “Buying” transaction system, etc. How are these resources identified, provided internally,
acquired as contractors, etc? What are the processes to justify, select and engage contracted resources?<b>Workflow
Publishing Processes</b> (a.k.a. “Content Management” – most common definition) 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>Select and Identify</i></b> Content within audience requirements and selection parameters – identifies
            that basic content needs
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>“Assign” (to Create, Acquire) – establishes the content owner and responsibility for the specific
            content</i></b>, based on the business rules, guidelines and objectives as defined by management, who is
            responsible for executing the creation or acquisition of content? This may reflect ongoing informational or
            content ownership, or it may be a short-term or finite assignment of responsibility associated with a campaign,
            program, event, or time-dependent occurrence.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>For example, a manufacturing organization may publish and maintain product information on an ongoing basis; however,
content needs may vary for a seasonal or cyclical catalog publishing effort for that same product base, or, they may be
different still for a short-term marketing campaign for a subset of the products. <br />
Another example would be web-delivered content for any time-dependent event, such as sporting events which have a defined
start and end. An individual (or team) might be assigned on a short-term basis to determine the content needs and determine
the content availability. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>Create/Acquire –</i></b> is the actual process of creating or acquiring content. The form of content may
            vary widely and is dependent upon the requirements defined by the content publishing owner (above). This
            content might be written, photographs (in multiple formats), video, audio, art, or composite “production.”
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>If the content is to be sourced externally, then the policies and guidelines must be followed, and the necessary
processes executed to acquire it in a timely fashion for its purpose. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>Submit or “Turn in” –</i></b> once created or acquired (and stored and indexed, in accordance with the
            management processes as defined), the content must be made available to the editor or “collector” of content
            who is ultimately responsible for the content publishing or delivery.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>Edit-</i></b> the content, once ‘received,’ must pass through a variety of editing cycles, for quality,
            format, indexing, etc. The required skills of the editor will vary according to the types of content to be
            reviewed.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>For example, a text editor must be aware of writing style rules and guides, and apply that knowledge in review of
writing quality, readability, purpose of content and accuracy of content. An art, photo, or audio editor would have similar
responsibilities and would use similar style rules and guides for their individual media; however, the skills and knowledge
base required to “edit” written copy, vs. photography, art, audio, or a multimedia “production” element are very different.
<br />
Multi-media editing requires a blend of all of these skills, and it may be the multi-media editor at his point in the
workflow who is responsible for assembling the elements into a publishing or deliverable entity or module. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>Review/Approve</i></b> – may link to external and/or governing processes that are beyond the control of
            the publishing organization or business unit, and may require maintenance of a specific audit trail, as well as
            factored lead time to complete.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>These organizations may be within the company, or they may be imposed by a local, state, or federal agency. <br />
For example, completed television segments must be passed to a censorship review group, and must iteratively pass through
the required external censorship process before the airdate. In the same way, where regulating bodies or internal company
controls are put in place, formal review and approval processes must be executed and documented. <br />
Some regulatory segments that may be required include: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Corporate level business rules, policies, guidelines
        </div>
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b><i>Timing (schedule/life cycle) –</i></b> also as part of the publishing cycle, the content must be
            associated with a particular duration: When will it first appear? When will it (if it will) be updated? When
            will it need to be reviewed, if no update schedule?When will it be removed and who must be notified. The
            scheduling information and change triggers must be set and associated with each specific piece of content.

            <b><i>Storage (Indexing/Description) –</i></b> Where will this content be stored while in “live” production?
            Which locations are upstream? Downstream? On peer locations for performance reasons? How will it be described
            for navigational purposes? Based on the information architecture for this content, what indices have to be

sub-processes, and then these roles and responsibilities must be integrated into a common definition, with a correlation
between positions and definitions of the relationships that support them. <br />
For example, the Content Selection Process does not specify the involvement of an Information Architect. However, there is
a relationship between the Information Architect, who must classify and establish the foundation for the navigational
constructs that will support the delivery of required content to a specific audience, and the Web Information Team/Content
Managers, who identify and select the content. <br />
These relationships must be identified and defined, along with critical linkage or control points. <br />
