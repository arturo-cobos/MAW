    <strong>Basic Ratio Analysis</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first step in creating the Financial Assessment work product is to calculate the current values of Basic Financial
    Ratios.&nbsp; "Key ratios" differ from industry to industry so it’s important to compile the list with the help of an
    "IBM industry expert" who genuinely knows the industry in which the client competes.&nbsp; Then, <u>verify</u> the list
    with client financial personnel. (Since this work is typically done in the proposal phase, client financial people may
    be wary of sharing information.&nbsp; Therefore, don’t let them reduce the scope suggested by the IBM industry
    expert.&nbsp; However, welcome any additions they suggest.)&nbsp; As discussed below, initially collect 10 years of
    quarterly data, if available.&nbsp; You should make sure this data is appropriate for the scope of the likely
    engagement: products, business units, geographical areas, etc. You’ll basically be looking for three kinds of data, in
    most cases:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Revenue and product volume,
    </li>
    <li>
        Costs (fixed/variable, direct/indirect, product/overhead), and
    </li>
    <li>
        Balance Sheet (assets, liabilities).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This data should be plugged into a spreadsheet to give you a snapshot of the business during the current period.&nbsp;
    Based on this data you can ask yourself (as well as other team members) a few key questions: Does every variable paint
    a picture of the business consistent with the others; e. g., is finished goods inventory appropriate for the sales
    volume? These answers should be used to develop "Value Hypotheses" regarding potential changes in technology and the
    business processes enabled.&nbsp; Frequently, these questions don’t have clear answers at this point.&nbsp; However,
    they are becoming extremely clear and important once you proceed to Trend Analysis step and/or begin creating the
    Financial Benchmarks work product.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Trend Analysis</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Frequently, it’s more important to know the direction and rate of change in a variable or ratio than it is to know its
    current value.&nbsp; That’s why the second major task in creating the Financial Assessment Work Product is Trend
    Analysis.&nbsp; Trend analysis begins by collecting relevant historical data on all of the variables and ratios
    documented in Basic Ratio Analysis.&nbsp; In most cases, you’ll want to collect the historical data at the same time
    you’re collecting the current data to save duplication of effort.&nbsp; While the relevant time period will depend on
    the specific variable, the industry, and the company, a good rule of thumb is to collect ten years of quarterly data if
    the company has been in business that long. (That’s plenty of history for examining the impact of typical environmental
    factors and management decisions. Change has become so rapid that few industries rely on trend data over ten years
    old.)&nbsp; Step two involves plugging the ten years of quarterly data (or whatever period you have access to) into a
    spreadsheet model that permits you to graphically display it.&nbsp; Look for four characteristics:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Clear trends (Can you explain the change?&nbsp; If it’s improving is everything appropriate being done to reinforce
        it?&nbsp; If it’s deteriorating, is everything appropriate being done to reverse it? Can you formulate a useful
        "Value Hypothesis" based on your answers to these questions?);
    </li>
    <li>
        Acceleration/deceleration in a trends (Can you explain the acceleration or deceleration?&nbsp; If it’s improving,
        is everything appropriate being done to reinforce it?&nbsp; If it’s deteriorating, is everything appropriate being
        done to reverse it? Can you formulate a useful "Value Hypothesis" based on your answers to these questions?); and
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes in direction of trends (Can you explain the change?&nbsp; If it’s improving, is everything appropriate
        being done to reinforce it?&nbsp; If it’s deteriorating, is everything appropriate being done to reverse it? Can
        you formulate a useful "Value Hypothesis" based on your answers to these questions?),
    </li>
    <li>
        Correlation (negative or positive) between two or more variables’ trends (Can you explain the correlations?&nbsp;
        If they are desirable, is everything appropriate being done to reinforce it?&nbsp; If they are undesirable, is
        everything appropriate being done to reverse it? Can you formulate a useful "Value Hypothesis" based on your
        answers to these questions?).&nbsp; - Often it helps to have someone "unfamiliar" with the industry perform this
        analysis (or at least the review data and conclusions) because experts often "assume" the answers to these
        questions without truly analyzing the data. (That’s one reason consultants in most strategy consulting firms tend
        to be "generalists," while the partners tend to be "industry experts"”&nbsp; The Consultants see the data and do
        the analysis, first. Then, they present their findings to a Partner who critiques their logic through an
        industry-specific lens.)
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Basic Micro-economic Analysis</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The final task in creating the Financial Assessment work product is to try to understand the underlying competitive
    economics of the business.&nbsp; Essentially, we’re talking about applying the trend data and the detail supporting it
    to build an understanding of the critical economic factors that determine success or failure in a specific business
    environment and the competitive behaviors/strategies favored by these economic factors. Quantitatively, we mean factors
    like industry maturity, industry concentration, and cost economics; e. g., scale, scope, and experience.&nbsp; (This
    typically requires you to collect information about industry structure/norms that will also be used in the creating the
    Financial Benchmarks work product.)&nbsp; Let’s briefly discuss 5 basic analyses that you will appreciate better after
    reading the strategy books in the References section:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Industry maturity - Industries typically follow a standard product life-cycle and this can be assessed by looking
        at the growth rate in revenues/units. In the introduction phase, growth is slow and positive; during the growth
        phase, it’s high and positive; during maturity it’s slow to neutral but seldom negative; and in decline the growth
        rate is generally negative from period to period.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Industry concentration: How many direct competitors are there? Starting with the largest, how many firms
        cumulatively account for half of the industry’s sales?&nbsp; Is the number of competitors increasing or
        decreasing?&nbsp; Is the client one of the largest or one of the smallest competitors?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Economies of Scale: What are the relative market shares of competitors?&nbsp; What are their relative gross
        margins? What are their relative product selling prices?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Economies of Scope: What is the relative breadth of each competitor’s set of offering and market segments served?
        What are their relative gross margins? What are their relative product selling prices?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Experience Curve Economics: What is the cumulative volume of products or services sold by each competitor, based on
        a common set of competencies? What are their relative gross margins? What are their relative product selling
        prices?<br />
    </li>
