<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">Using the client's process definition, identify the tools that the client has installed to implement it. Recognize that a
specific tool may be used to implement one or more processes, and also that the client may have multiple tools installed to
implement a single process, especially where different tools are required to support different types of managed element.
<br />
Use the "Score sheet" as a template for tool evaluation. The twelve criteria should be repeated for each tool associated
with a "generic tool". <br />
Three maturity measures must be evaluated for each tool / characteristic pair. The "capability" of the tool identifies how
well the tool, if installed and customized completely, could implement the client's process. The "implemented" measure
identifies the extent of implementation that has been accomplished by the client. The "required" measure identifies the
client's goal for tool implementation to support the process. <br />
Note that it is possible for a tool's "capability" to be less than the client's "required" measure. This indicates that the
tool cannot fully implement the client's process as defined, and either must be replaced or enhanced by adding another tool
to provide missing function. <br />
