<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The following are the guidelines for developing an Organizational Transition Plan<br />
<p>
    1. Identify all activities and resources required for organization transition<br />
    2. Produce organization transition plan<br />
    3. Reassess benefits and set success targets<br />
    4. Recommend plan<br />
    5. Review and evaluate progress
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Identify all Activities and Resources Required for Organization Transition</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Activities</i></b><br />
    Identify the full range of activities required to implement the redesigned organization structure, behaviors, and
    enablers. Some tasks will be unique to the redesigned elements; no attempt will be made in this work product
    description to list all the project-specific possibilities. However, others, such as most of those listed below, are
    more generic and will appear in most organization transition plans.<br />
    At this point be careful not to confuse planning the activities with performing the activities. For example, the goal
    in this work product is to lay out all the steps required to prepare role players, manage issues, run pilots, etc. The
    actions themselves will occur when the plan is implemented.<br />
    The activities in this step are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>

            Communication
        </div>
    </li>

            HR retention, redeployment, severance, and recruitment
        </div>

        <div>
            Facilities and supplies
        </div>

            Progress evaluations

    <li>
        <div>
            Coordination
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Communication</b><br />
    Identify communication messages, timing, and delivery media to incorporate into the overall communication plan and
    produce materials and events.<br />
    <b>Training</b><br />
    Identify training requirements and timing to incorporate into the overall training plan and act as subject matter
    experts to help training team produce materials and events.<br />
    <b>Preparing Role Players to Model New Behaviors</b><br />
    Work with communication event presenters, trainers, sponsors, and change leaders so that they will model targeted new
    behaviors as they play their roles in transition activities<br />
    <b>HR Retention, Redeployment, Severance, and Recruitment</b><br />
    Work with the client’s HR organization to set parameters for actions needed to support new organization structure and
    job designs. The organization redesign is likely to require staffing changes to at least some degree. The client’s
    human resources organization should become involved to ensure that the new organization will have the workforce it
    needs. Client HR policy and practice will bound these activities:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                If a promise has been made that no one will lose his job, then no severance activity is required
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                If only a few new jobs are designed, recruitment may be a relatively minor activity
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                If there is a hiring freeze, new positions will have to be filled by re-deploying current employees.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    Defining these boundaries should be the first activity.<br />
    Once the HR strategy for staffing is understood, review how HR strategy was changed for earlier initiatives and
    identify successes and pitfalls. Review HR best practices. Then define the activities that will be undertaken to
    support the organization transition. Avoid being drawn into major HR changes that extend well beyond the scope of the
    initiative. However, in the case of significant redesign of structure, behavior, and enablers, most HR programs will
    need to be revamped. This may include tailoring recruitment campaigns, altering selection criteria and methods, and
    developing new rewards to attract talent.<br />
    These activities should span all applicable levels of staff in the client organization, including the executive level.
    Recruitment, selection, redeployment, and separation activities at the senior level will be highly customized.
    Management development activities may also be required.<br />
    These aspects of the organization transition plan must be implemented by the client rather than by the consulting
    team.<br />
    <b>Facilities and Supplies</b><br />
    Construct new space, reconfigure existing space, relocate workers and offices, supply the desktop with required
    hardware and software, set up phone and mail service, establish access to forms and documentation (online or paper),
    retire old equipment or end leases.<br />
    <b>Pilots</b><br />
    The activities to consider in developing the transition plan for a pilot include:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                identify likely candidates,
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                set selection criteria,
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                select pilot participants,
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                design the pilot,
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                implement the pilot,
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                provide support to pilot participants,
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                evaluate the pilot, and
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                adjust plans based on lessons learned.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    When determining whether to incorporate a pilot into the organization transition plan, consider the following potential
    benefits of a pilot:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                Provides a working example to the rest of the organization
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Proves to other groups that the changes can derive benefits
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Indicates how to refine the transition plan using lessons learned
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Builds a source of future support and advice for the rest of the organization
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    Pilots groups may be based around processes or organization groups. Good candidates for pilots possess the following
    characteristics:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                The change leader who will be involved is influential and enthusiastic.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Employees who will be involved have favorable experiences with change in the past and a good understanding
                of how the changes will benefit their area.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                There are few or no opponents of the change working in the area involved.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    More limited, small-scale events, which allow people to experience new roles and practice new behaviors, may also be
    appropriate. This could include scenario walkthroughs, a mock office or laboratory/sandbox facility, or role-playing
    workshops.<br />
    When planning the pilot, be sure to consider the ripple effect of changes in the pilot group to the other groups they
    work with regularly, and develop an approach to manage and monitor these interfaces during the transition.<br />
    <b>Feedback Mechanisms</b><br />
    Establish channels and events (e.g., focus groups, surveys, unit meetings, interview stakeholders, suggestion box,
    dedicated help line) to solicit feedback, regularly analyze feedback, and conduct action planning meetings.<br />
    Feedback mechanisms should be designed to encourage employees to raise issues such as the following:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                Employees don’t understand what is expected of them. This may be related to where they fit in the new
                organization, how they are expected to conduct themselves, and how to the enablers are supposed to help
                them.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Employees don’t like the new ways of operating and have begun resorting to the old methods.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                The new organization design is not working as intended or cannot address situations that have arisen and
                that had not been anticipated.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    Availability of feedback mechanisms should be widely publicized and frequently emphasized via the communication
    plan.<br />
    <b>Progess Evaluations</b><br />
    Measure meeting target success criteria (setting up measuring mechanisms, establishing measurement schedule, collecting
    and analyzing data, recommending actions).<br />
    Consider orienting some of the feedback mechanisms, such as survey or focus group questions, to extract perceptions
    about meeting the success criteria for the transition to the new organization design.<br />
    <b>Issue Management</b><br />
    Create mechanisms and events to surface and resolve issues<br />
    Weekly or biweekly meetings should review progress against the transition plan and highlight areas of concern. Actions
    to resolve issues that were assigned in previous meetings should also be reviewed for progress. New issues should be
    ranked and assigned to an individual for resolution within agreed timeframes, or raised to a higher level in the
    project governance structure for resolution. Depending on the project, issue management may occur at more than one
    level of the project and within more than one team or sub-team.<br />
    <b>Coordination</b><br />
    Coordinate organization transition with other project elements, and project team meetings and reviews.
</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">
    <i>Resources</i>
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    For each activity, identify the resources required. This should include:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                People
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Cost
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>People</b><br />
    The roles required and the individuals desired for the role, the amount of time required from each person for each
    activity.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Make explicit any assumptions about availability.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify from among the full group of stakeholders and change leaders those who in particular will have
            responsibility for the organization transition. For organization transition, change leaders should be those
            who:
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
    <p>
        - Are sympathetic to the workforce<br />
        - Set an example of good practice<br />
        - Can sustain the momentum of change<br />
        - Are willing to identify and offer individual help to those who need extra support<br />
        - Will look for reverting to the old system and bring it up as an issue
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">
    In larger projects, the organization transition itself usually requires some roles beyond those generally needed for
    transition as a whole. It will probably require its own transition manager and a team to monitor progress.<br />
    <b>Cost</b><br />
    An estimate of cost of materials and services required to carry out the activities of the organization
    transition.<br />
    <strong>Produce Organization Transition Plan</strong><br />
    All of the activities identified in Step 1 need to be scheduled into a project plan. The plan will specify the sequence
    and pace of activities and will take dependencies among activities into account. This plan will be compiled into the
    integrated transition plan and should be in a compatible format.<br />
    The elements of the plan in this step are:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                Sequence
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Pace
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Dependencies
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Sequence</i></b><br />
    Large implementations often are accomplished in phases. Phases can be set up to roll out the change by process,
    technology, geography, organizational group, or a variety of other factors. The organization transition plan should be
    synchronized with, and may also influence, the phasing defined for other domains of the project.<br />
    If there is to be a pilot, it will of course be the first event in the sequence. While the lessons learned from the
    pilot can lead to changes in the sequence, it should nonetheless be drafted at this stage. A variety of factors will
    influence sequence, many of which will be specific to the client. Some typical factors are:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                Outstanding leases on equipment and facilities
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Seasonal trends and workload on various process areas
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Schedule for labor negotiations
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Cumulative impact of any other initiatives causing change
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Timetable of other activities related to this initiative (e.g., application go-live dates, offering
                announcements)
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    Areas of high risk and complexity may be best left until the end. By that time the momentum of change may have swept
    away much of the initial resistance, and if not, the implementation team will have plenty of experience to draw upon in
    meeting tougher challenges.<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Pace</i></b><br />
    An appropriate pace for transition may strain the capacity of people to assimilate change, but it should not lead to
    chaos. A period of uncertainty and discomfort is a normal outcome of disengaging from the status quo, but a transition
    that is too quick will produce higher levels of stress and conflict that could threaten long-term project success.
    Conversely, if the transition is too long and protracted, support may dwindle for the changes and only a portion of
    them may actually be implemented. Some of the factors that will influence the pace of change are:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                Scale of the change: large-scale changes such as a shift in organization culture will require longer
                timelines.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Industry: in some industries, initiatives are expected to reap rewards in relatively short timeframes.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Degree of complacency: just as urgency would force a speedier pace, complacency will slow things down. For
                example, more time will be needed to impress the need for change upon stakeholders who are already market
                leaders.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Level of inertia: with little recent experience of major change, an organization will take more time in the
                beginning to get started.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    One rule of thumb suggests adding 50% to any first estimates of organization transition timescales. Before a major
    change starts, allow enough time for stakeholders and leaders to absorb what is going to happen. Afterward, allow for a
    period of consolidation and recognition for success.<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Dependencies</i></b><br />
    Once the sequence and pace for all activities have been identified, determine whether any dependencies exist among
    activities in the plan. Re-sequence any items out of order, and ensure that the right amount of time has been left
    between them. Review resource requirements and resolve any conflicts. One rule of thumb calls for utilizing resources
    for no more than 80% of their work hours, because they will still be needed in their regular role, even if only to
    provide guidance to those filling in for them.
</p><strong>Reassess Benefits and Set Success Targets</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    The documented plan will provide a clearer picture of the hurdles ahead, but it will also define when the benefits of
    the initiative will start to accrue. At this point it is valuable to reassess the benefits expected from implementing
    the organization redesign. With the benefits in mind, set success targets for the implementation. Agree on what it will
    mean for an activity to be considered "complete." Determine how data about success will be collected.<br />
    Targets should reflect the client’s particular concerns. A few examples include:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                Issues focus (analysis of issues raised and solved, speed of resolution)
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Success or failure focus (anecdotal or survey evidence of perceived success)
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Risk focus (measuring progress in high risk areas)
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    Success targets should also include standard project management issues, such as meeting milestones and staying within
    budget.
</p><strong>Recommend Plan</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    The organization transition plan needs to be owned by the client, and by the human resources department in particular.
    Client team members who have helped to create the plan are usually very effective in selling it to the decision-makers
    who must approve it and make the required resources available.
</p><strong>Review and Evaluate Progress</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Based on the schedule set in the project plan, review and evaluate progress. If success criteria are not being met,
    look for the root cause and be prepared to adjust timelines as needed.
