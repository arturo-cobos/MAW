<h3>
    Assess Organization Alignment against the Future Business Context
</h3>
<p>
    <b><i>Assess Strategic Alignment</i></b><br />
    The most fundamental organization design principle of all is that “structure should support strategy.” Elements of the
    structure should support competitive positions by concentrating management attention on strategic imperatives, while
    allocating resources and accountabilities in terms of business priorities, by considering people’s competencies and
    abilities. Behaviors will determine whether the corporate culture is aligned with the strategic goals and capabilities
    of the organization. This also includes considerations on how the corporation is capable of facing the external
    requirements in terms of accessibility. At a higher level, the company should be able not only to satisfy a customer’s
    request, but to promote accessible solutions and products to its customers. The Enablers of an organization should
    support the business imperatives through performance management, motivation systems, and training and
    development.<br />
    Map out the key strategic imperatives for the organization, for example, reduce overhead costs, increase speed of
    response to market, or identify opportunities for exploiting employees’ competencies and abilities. Once you understand
    what the strategic goals are, conduct workshops or interviews with key clients to assess the extent to which the
    organization structure, behaviors, and enablers are aligned with the strategy. Use the Strategic Alignment Matrix Tool
    to map out your findings.

<b><i>Assess Bureaucracy Alignment</i></b> <br />
Bureaucracy refers to an organization model that defines jobs, responsibilities, and relationships in a hierarchical,
systematic framework, and it has neutral connotations in this work product. The circumstances of a business should drive
decisions on the nature and extent of bureaucracy or corporate staff. The need for bureaucracy is proportional to the needs
of the business for economies of scale, consistency, adherence to standards, and centralized control. <br />
<b><i>Assess Process Alignment</i></b> <br />
The most effective organizations are aligned with core process goals and emphasize horizontal work and information flows.
You should have an understanding of whether your client’s teams, performance management system elements, competencies,
communication structures, and behaviors are aligned with and support process-defined needs: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Does the structure facilitate the direct flow of work and information? Is this flow of work and information
            accessible?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Are resources allocated on the basis of process needs?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Are resources allocated on the basis of their abilities, competencies, and skills (utilize Human Capabilities
            Assessment work product)? This implies an understanding of disabled people’s needs and abilities and allows for
            better fit of their capabilities to tasks.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Are communication support systems designed to facilitate a process-oriented environment by aligning workflows
            with information flows?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Have considerations been explored based on the need for special process considerations for employees with
            disabilities? For example, have the software or web applications been enabled so that skilled employees with
            disabilities can still perform the tasks?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><i>Assess Resource Allocation Alignment</i></b><br />
    In an aligned organization, there should be consistency between business goals and the allocation resources. Functions
    and units with key process goals should be appropriately resourced. Resources should be allocated by process as well as
    by function and should be measurable against customer-defined objectives. Use the Financial Resource Allocation to
    Business Goals table to help in understanding which resources are allocated by function and process.

<h3>
    Assess Organization Efficiency against the Future Business Context
</h3>Organization efficiency is a factor of how well the organization is able to achieve its performance expectations with
a minimum amount of resources. Resource usage is measured in two ways: 
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            The value of physical resources required, that is, facility/operational costs, overhead, communication systems
            costs
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Costs associated with achieving coordination, that is, costs of decision making, cost of organization
            inefficiencies
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
    Remember that an efficient organization is effective in minimizing both the absolute number of resources it requires to
    operate and the extent to which organization structures, behaviors, and enablers stand in the way of conducting
    business. The more resources are allocated by considering their competencies, the higher the savings in time and
    resource cost for a particular task. In addition, the quality of the final product or service will be greatly elevated.
    This demonstrates that a skill map of employees’ competencies is one of the best means of improving efficiency.
    Accessibility may positively affect efficiency. For example, if employees with disabilities are employed in processes
    that engage suppliers or customers who also have disabilities, the barriers will have already been dealt with and
    sensitivities to special needs will be inherent.
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>Assess Efficiency Measures</i></b><br />
    Efficiency measures indicate whether the elements of the organization are cost-effectively designed and managed to
    achieve the goal of the business. Obvious efficiency measures are operating and managing costs and what the company
    does with the cost data. Less obvious are the non-financial costs, and these may be difficult to access. These include
    measures such as speed of decision making and efficiency in information sharing. Use the Efficiency Measures Checklist
    to help you understand what efficiency measures are in place and where the gaps are.

    An efficient organization uses the minimum amount of human resources and other assets to achieve a given level of
    coordination and communication. Use the Human Resources/Assets to Accomplish Business Goals matrix to map out how many
    people and what assets are allocated to each of the strategic imperatives. You can then see if there are resources that
    are under- or over-allocated.

<b><i>Assess Bureaucratic Efficiency</i></b> <br />
Bureaucracies are created to coordinate activities and to facilitate communication. Examine the bureaucracies of the
organization and see if the amount of bureaucracy exceeds or does not meet the demand. Remember that the need for
bureaucracy varies depending on the requirements of the organization. <br />
<b><i>Assess Efficiency of Coordination and Communication</i></b> <br />
Coordination and communication systems are often a time and resource drain on organizations. Make sure you identify any
barriers or redundancies in these systems. 
<h3>
    Assess Performance Effectiveness against the Future Business Context
</h3>Effective organizations have a systematically defined and managed set of programs designed to foster high levels of
human performance. A key element of employee retention and productivity is providing opportunities for workers to grow
skills. To assess performance effectiveness, you must determine where the weaknesses in the development of employees exist
and where the opportunities to provide capabilities exist. Refer to the Human Capabilities Assessment work product. <br />
<b><i>Assess Appropriate Levels of Performance</i></b> <br />
The performance of an organization depends on the performance of its people, both collectively and individually. The first
area to assess is whether the levels of human performance are right and if a system is in place to support the
requirements. Performance can be influenced by such things as: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Environment (Is it accessible to everyone? Lighting? Space?)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Processes
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Motivation
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Definition of performance requirements
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Leadership
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Incentives
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Examine these factors, and any other you can identify, to see where the strengths and weaknesses lie.<br />
    <b><i>Assess Human Performance Support Systems</i></b><br />
    The human performance requirements need to be backed up with an equally clear support system (including tools and
    technology) that is responsible for removing barriers and that is relevant to all employees, including employees with
    disabilities.<br />
    <b><i>Assess Competency and Skill Development Process</i></b><br />
    Competencies and skills should be managed as a corporate asset and employee competencies and skills must be kept
    current with the business goals. Make sure you examine the process of employee development and how the culture,
    strategies (including accessibility), and priorities either support or undermine this process.<br />
    <b><i>Assess Organization Learning Processes and Practices</i></b><br />
    Use the Learning Process Checklist tool to understand how learning and knowledge sharing is promoted, facilitated, and
    enabled throughout the organization. Keep in mind that employees in an optimal organization should have the skills and
    knowledge required to perform and the learning process should be continuous, cumulative, accessible to those with
    disabilities and collaborative. Learning requirements should be linked to both human performance and business
    imperatives.

    <br />
    <b><i>Assess Human Performance Measurement</i></b><br />
    Use the Human Performance Measurement Process Checklist to review how measurements are used to facilitate growth and
    learning across levels of the organization. Remember that measures are how the organization communicates to the
    employees about what is important and valued and they are an important driver in human and organization
    performance.<br />
    <b><i>Assess Appropriate Accessibility Needs</i></b><br />
    Ensure that the performance assessment considers barriers to people with disabilities. For example, some assessments
    incorrectly identify a blind employee as poorly or unable to perform a database administrator job, but the problem
    isn’t the person’s capabilities or skills, it is the software that has barriers in it that prevent the assistive
    technology used by the database administrator from working or working efficiently.<br />

<h3>
    Determine the Priorities for Redesign
</h3>Once you have gathered and assessed all the relevant information and discovered the issues, it is necessary to
prioritize the redesign areas to best meet the future business goals. <br />
Use the Issue Prioritization and Presentation tool to map issues according to the severity of impact and the need to be
addressed. The tool itself is a checklist and a spreadsheet for scoring each issue and plotting them on a two-over-two
matrix. <br />
The results of the issue prioritization then yield a simple guide to action, based on four possible quadrant placements: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Redesign should include these items
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A separate program is needed to address these items
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Optional opportunities exist in these items
        </div>
    </li>
