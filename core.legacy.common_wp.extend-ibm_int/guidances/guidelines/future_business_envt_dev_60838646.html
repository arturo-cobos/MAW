    The basic steps in defining the Future Business Environment are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Determine the organization issues that will provide the decision focus and specify the key decision factors
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand the current business environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify and analyze the key environmental forces
    </li>
    <li>
        Choose the tools and techniques to use for selecting among the future environment alternatives and developing the
        detail for each future environment definition
    </li>
    <li>
        Define (elaborate upon) the future environments
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify signposts or indicators that should be watched to signify that a particular future environment is emerging
    </li>
    <li>
        Interpret the future environment definitions for their decision implications
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    While all of the steps outlined above are required in order to define the future business environment, the first three
    steps are primarily viewed as inputs (or activities that generate the required inputs) from the perspective of the
    future environment definition work product. Step one (determine the organization issues…) is comprised of activities
    that fall within scope of the method component entitled Focal Area Definition. These activities have as their output a
    strategic question that needs to be answered or focused set of strategic issues that the organization needs to
    understand. The second step (understand the current business environment) describes the current environment in the
    following terms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The PLAYERS that make up the organization’s Value Net – customers, suppliers, competitors and companies that
        provide complimentary products or services
    </li>
    <li>
        How each of the players in the Value Net ADD or capture VALUE
    </li>
    <li>
        The RULES of competition within the relevant environment
    </li>
    <li>
        TACTICS for how each of the players in the Value Net position themselves relative to the other players
    </li>
    <li>
        The SCOPE or artificial boundaries established for the competitive environment (geographic, product based, etc.)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This PARTS framework is developed as part of an overall environmental analysis that should also identify the
    environmental forces relevant to the strategic question or issues that comprise the focal area of the engagement (the
    first part of Step 3).
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Step 3: Identify and analyze the key environmental forces</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    Using a list of identified environmental forces, the project team needs to gain a clear understanding of their future
    prospects. The following excerpt from <u>Learning from the Future</u> (Liam & Fahey) describes how and why this is
    done.
</p>
<p>
    “In practice, a complex analysis (for determining the impact of these forces) is not required. The basic thrust of this
    analysis should move quickly to focus on the fewest, most important forces. At a minimum, however, your discussion of
    these environmental forces should cover:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Their apparent direction today – that is, current trends and the reasons for them
    </li>
    <li>
        Their future prospects – that is, how much, in what ways, and how fast these trends might change in the future.
        Your assessment of these prospects should clearly differentiate between trends and developments that you believe to
        be relatively predictable and those about which you have some feeling of uncertainty.
    </li>
    <li>
        Their relevance to the decision focus – that is, the direction and magnitude of their impact on the future course
        of the key decision factors.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At this stage, you need to start sorting these forces, recognizing that they are not all equally important or equally
    uncertain. For instance, while the typical analysis will likely identify a total of 50 or so such forces, the number of
    key drivers of the business will certainly be significantly fewer. Moreover, while uncertainty is a prevailing
    condition of the business environment, not everything is uncertain. Indeed, some key demographic trends may be
    considered virtually predetermined elements of the future. For example, the consumers of the next decade are already
    born, so their number is already known, but not their purchasing power and taste. In your planning and decision-making,
    you need to be very specific about what is important, and what is truly uncertain, and why.
</p>
<p>
    To be systematic in this sorting-out process, you can use an impact / uncertainty matrix. With a simple high-medium-low
    scoring system, you can position each one of these forces on the matrix. Rate each of these forces in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The levels of impact on the key decision factors (obviously, all the forces are presumed to have some impact, but
        some are more important than others).
    </li>
    <li>
        The degree of uncertainty you feel about the direction, pace, or fact of its future course.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As a result of this sorting you can focus your attention and the search for scenario logics (the organizing principles
    around which the future environment definitions will be structured) in the next step (Step 4).”
</p>
<p>
    The Impact/Uncertainty matrix is provided as an example of an impact / uncertainty matrix that can be used to evaluate
    relevant environmental forces. More experienced practitioners may have their own tools and techniques for determining
    the relative uncertainty of an environmental force and its impact on the future environment. Those practitioners should
    continue to use the tools with which they feel the most comfortable and have proven project success.

    Upon completion of the rankings for each of the environmental forces, the data should be entered, along with a detailed

    Data collection that is required to sort the environmental forces can be done using any number of methods. Selection of
    a specific method will depend on the level of integration of the Future Business Environment with the current
    environment as well as the working style of the particular client. The preferred methods for environmental force data
    collection are client interview and workshop. While questionnaires have been used for this type of data gathering, this
    approach eliminates the opportunity to probe specific responses and ensure understanding of the presented questions.
</p>
<p>
    What should be obvious at this point is the requirement for extensive input from the client in identifying and
    analyzing the relevant environmental forces. While SMEs may have enough understanding of a particular industry to
    identify the environmental forces shaping that industry, each company responds and is impacted differently by changes
    in the environment. This places critical importance on involving the appropriate client personnel in this activity.
    Leveraging client insight in this aspect of the engagement will lend credibility to any conclusions drawn from the
    analysis, build/maintain client interest in the project and shift the burden of responsibility for omissions or
    misstatements in the analysis.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Step 4: Choose the tools and techniques to use for selecting among the future environment alternatives and
    developing the detail for each future environment definition</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    In order to ensure that the level of resources invested in understanding the future is appropriate and that the
    understanding of the future is adequate to make strategic decisions, the project team needs to select the tools and
    techniques appropriate to the level of uncertainty about the future. The following activities in Step 4 will help
    determine the key forces driving uncertainty in the environment, the category of uncertainty into which the future
    environment falls and which of the available tools and techniques should be employed to elaborate on the detail of the
    future environment.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Using the Environmental Forces Ranking created in Step 3, determine the forces that are most important and most
        uncertain.</i> With the overall goal of limiting the number of potential future environment definitions to just a
        few whose differences make a difference to decision-makers, the list of key environmental forces needs to be pared
        down to those that will influence the future environment and whose impact cannot be determined. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Are all the forces truly relevant to the strategic question being asked or the issues facing the
                organization?
            </li>
            <li>
                Will the environmental forces likely change the environment during the time period relevant to the
                strategic question under consideration or will the event unfold farther out on the time horizon?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is the evolution of the environmental force unknowable or would further research enable a determination of
                the outcome?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        In trying to answer these questions and determine the potential outcomes for the relevant environmental forces, the
        use of SMEs is highly recommended. Although a great deal of this expertise does not lie within the walls of IBM,
        sources for this information can be found in government agencies, think tanks, private research organizations and
        academic institutions. Participation by recognized leaders in specific areas can garner credibility for the
        analysis but the benefits must be weighed against any loss in credibility for the project team and the cost of
        employing external experts.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        Based on the number and uncertain outcome of the forces expected to impact the environment during the relevant time
        horizon, select the category of uncertainty into which the future environment falls. Research has shown that
        basically four broad categories of uncertainty exist in describing future business environments. Organizations
        attempting to answer a strategic question with a relatively short relevant time horizon over which the environment
        will not change or expected changes are well understood face “A Clear Enough Future”. As time horizons lengthen,
        the scope of strategic questions expand and the predictability of environmental forces declines, uncertainty about
        the shape the future environment will take increases until participants in that environment face “True Ambiguity”.

        the final categorization decision is primarily subjective. No analytical tools exist to turn predictions for
        changes in the environment based on experience and “gut feel” into objective outcomes. In this case, selection of
        the appropriate category comes about as a result of diligent research, detailed analysis of all available inputs

    Many consultants who have experience in this area should have realized by this point that there have been numerous
    instances where Scenario Planning and other future definition techniques were sold well in advance of understanding the
    relative uncertainty in the environment as described above. The position this paper is taking in regards to those
    situations is that the sale of any type of future environment definition services should only be done upon the
    completion of some type of environmental uncertainty analysis. These services can be done as part of either a billable
    engagement, as part of pre-sale investigation or by a third party. However, if the degree of rigor applied to the
    upstream activities does not provide a level of confidence adequate to define the future environment, then the project
    team must be willing to modify its approach to one that employs tools and techniques relevant to the newly uncovered
    level of uncertainty.

    the various tools and techniques and how it fits within the overall strategy methodology.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    At the beginning of this step, a framework called PARTS was outlined as the preferred means for presenting information
    about the relevant environment due to its basis in the development and analysis of Value Nets. Step 5 will describe how
    this PARTS framework should be used to describe the future environment end states and how they will evolve from the
    current environment.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    In order to provide a brief refresh of PARTS, the elements of the framework have been reintroduced below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        Players – participants in the organization’s Value Net: customers, suppliers, competitors and complimentors

        specific, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Using the tools and techniques identified for the category of uncertainty, the project team defines the future
    environment using the previously described PARTS framework. This essentially paints a picture of the end point or the
    future state. However, the journey, or the path through which the environment is expected to evolve, is just as
    important as the destination.
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        What environmental force will change first? Next? Will multiple changes occur simultaneously?
    </li>

    For organizations making decisions in a relatively certain future will generate a description of one path and one
    destination. Organizations facing a greater level of uncertainty will have descriptions of multiple end states and the
    journeys that the organization will take to get there. As uncertainty increases and the number of alternative futures
    grows, it is critical that the project team provides full detail on each alternative. Only by fully detailing each
    alternative will the team be able to identify the signposts (described in Step 6) necessary for predicting the
    occurrence of a particular future.
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b><u>Step 6: Identify signposts or indicators that should be watched to signify that a particular future environment
    is emerging</u></b>
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    The following excerpt from <u>Scenario Planning – Managing for the Future</u> (Ringland) describes the importance of
    identifying leading indicators and signposts:
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    “It is important to know as soon as possible which if he several future environments or scenarios is closest to the
    course of history as it actually unfolds. Sometimes that direction is obvious, especially with regard to factors like
    the health of the overall economy, but sometimes the leading indicators for a given scenario can be subtle. How, for
    example, should one calibrate the speed of economic restructuring from a smokestack economy towards an
    information-intensive economy? – By help-wanted advertising according to different SIC codes? – By union memberships? –
    By subscriptions to indicative periodicals?
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Once the different scenarios have been fleshed out and their implications for the focal issue determined, then it’s
    worth spending time and imagination on identifying a few indicators to monitor in an ongoing way. If those indicators
    are selected carefully and imaginatively, the company will gain a jump on its competition in knowing what the future
    holds for a given industry and how that future is likely to affect strategies and decisions in the industry.
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    If the scenarios have been built according to the previous steps (as outlined in this document), then the scenarios
    will be able to translate movements of a few key indicators into an orderly set of industry-specific implications. The
    logical coherence that was built in tot he scenarios will allow logical implications of leading indicators to be drawn
    out of the scenarios.”

    The real value in trying to understand the future is not just in determining what it will look like but also in
    determining when it will happen. Using signposts to indicate the evolution of a future environment allows an
    organization to prepare for change, not respond to it.<br />
    In order to develop signposts for each of the future environments that have been defined, the project team needs to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        Work out the warning signals as the future environments are being defined. This reduces the chance for
        misinterpretation when those who first constructed the environment are no longer available.
    </li>
    <li style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        Link the indicators with the defined environment by communicating how the indicator will lead to the changes
        outlined in the environment definition (i.e. changes in an environmental force leading to the introduction of new
        players in the Value Net).
    </li>
    <li style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        Select and link multiple indicators. Ensure that efforts to investigate the evolution of a particular future are
        warranted. Think about the boy who cried “Wolf!”
    </li>
    <li style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        Recognize that asking the same question in a different horizon will not necessary translate into the use of similar
        signposts.
    </li>
</ul>

    <b><u>Step 7: Interpret the future environment definitions for their decision implications</u></b>
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Development of future environment definitions is primarily done in the context of formulating a business strategy and
    identifying business opportunities. As such, decision implications for the future will be determined through
    opportunity identification or strategy formulation.
