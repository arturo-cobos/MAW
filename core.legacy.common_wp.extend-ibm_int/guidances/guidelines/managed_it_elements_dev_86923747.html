<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The following steps should be followed:<br />
<br />
<b>Step 1.</b> Review the overall picture of the technology that is to be managed. This should be a check on the technology
scope of the project as well. The following topics should be considered during the discussion: <br />
<u>Identify the Major Components</u>. Identify the major components needed to deliver the key services and mission critical
business application. Components can be systems, servers, workstations, network elements, programs, or data. The component
identification needs only to be done at a level sufficient to clearly differentiate what will and what will not be included
in the target system. Where there is potential for ambiguity, list related or similar components that are specifically
excluded from the scope of the target system. <br />
<u>Identify Exclusions</u>. Review each component of the target system for factors that might require that a component be
excluded from the scope of the management system being designed. Before making a final decision to exclude a particular
component, think through the potential management and service-quality ramifications of doing so. <br />
<u>Document the Target System Scope</u>. A diagram showing the components needed to deliver the business application or
service, indicating what is included and excluded from the target system, is often the most effective way to document the
scope of the target system. Capture any explanatory notes or rationale that might be needed to reference later. <br />
<b>Step 2.</b> Select the Appropriate View. To form element groups that have meaning in a specific environment, the
designer must know the business strategy, critical success factors and business applications of the enterprise. These
factors must be examined to clearly understand systems management in the client's context. This understanding was obtained
in the generation of the Systems Management Principles. The principles establish the style to be used in managing the
defined environment. This style is matched to a specific view. It is sometimes valuable early in the decomposition process
to use more than one view. The different insights obtained can be discussed with the client and the most suitable view
selected. <i>Note that to use the templates from the SMFD-TE method, the component view must be selected.</i> <br />
<b>Step 3.</b> Define the managed element list. Note that, while hardware and software components tend to dominate the
element axis, other element types such as services provided by common carriers or internet providers may, in many cases, be
included on the axis. However, elements should not be included if they do not reside within the target environment as
previously defined. <br />
To finalize the components to be included on the element axis list it is important to conduct an objective "reasonableness
check" to ensure that the list has not grown to an impractical length. The client sponsor should review the list for
accuracy and then give their approval. The sponsor must be cautioned that too long a list will create a higher level of
complexity and therefore may jeopardize the success of the engagement, as there will be temptation to add additional
elements. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Start with the straw man list of elements provided by the SMFD-TE method.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Meet with designated clients and create element list by adding to and changing the straw man list.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Conduct "reasonableness check" of significant elements list. Ensure the following:
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        - The element axis is composed of only significant elements.<br />
        - The length of the element axis is manageable, given the scope of the engagement.<br />
        - The element axis represents all essential management requirements of the target environment.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Where possible, consolidate or "roll-up" the elements into aggregate groups of elements in order to facilitate
    completion of the design work and to eliminate useless discussions. The guideline used for combining elements into
    groups should be whether the specific technology elements in question generate unique and significant skill, tool, and
    data requirements or not. If they do, then keep them as separate entities in the element list. If they do not, then
    combine them with similar elements to form a "generic" grouping of elements; i.e. generic desktop peripherals. See the
    SMFD-TE method for a complete discussion.
