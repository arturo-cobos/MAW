    The primary steps in performing a Capability Model Assessment are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify linkages between internal and external capabilities and between external capabilities and value net player
        segments
    </li>
    <li>
        Assess capabilities by customer segment
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <b><u>Step 1: Refine and clarify the Focus Definition (scope of activities that will be assessed)</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to performing the Capability Model Assessment, the scope of the engagement should be defined and used as input to
    the assessment. The Focus Definition should then be refined and clarified in order ensure that a “manageable” area has
    been established to meet the needs of the assessment in the agreed to scope of the engagement. The following areas
    should be reviewed, refined and clarified as needed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Breadth of coverage: Number of business units, geographic boundaries, Value Net Player, customer segments, other
        segments, major processes (CRM, SCM, etc.), business functions, products and services, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Depth of coverage: High-level capability analysis versus detailed capability analysis, Capabilities only versus
        capabilities plus capability enabler identification and analysis (normally not done at this level), degree of
        analysis of areas such as capability relationships (linkages) etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Accessibility of information: Existing analysis, access to client SMEs, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Other “scope” related information that will help the team focus on the assessment of relevant capabilities needed
        for the engagement
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition to refining and clarifying the scope, it is beneficial to review (if done previously) or document the
    current business context in which these capabilities are operating. The assessment of the capabilities is based in
    large part on the internal and external business context. For example, new environmental regulations on electric
    utilities may cause the capability, “Ability to produce low cost energy,” to perform poorly. In another example, the
    internal culture of a large Fortune 500 firm may severely impact the capability, “Ability to quickly design and build
    new products.”
</p>
<p>
    The execution of Step 1 will directly impact the amount and quality of the work performed in the following steps.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>Step 2: Identify the capabilities within the Focus Definition</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    This step is highly iterative. The Value Net Players and their subsequent segments are the starting points for the
    identification of capabilities. The step starts from the outside of the value net with the value exchanges between the
    firm and segment and moves inward until finally concluding with the identification of non-player specific capabilities,
    e.g., capabilities that support more than one value net player. The step can be broken down as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Confirm Value Net Players and their subsequent segments (from Step 1)
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat the following steps for <u>each</u> segment in <u>each</u> Value Net Player category (Customer,
        Complementor, Supplier and Competitor) to identify the <b><i>Externally Focused Capabilities</i></b>: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identify the Value Exchanges – for the purpose of this analysis the focus is on the touch points (Moments
                of Truth, interactions, etc.), not the exact type and detail associated with the value exchange elements,
                value proposition and value capture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify the <i>Externally Focused Capabilities</i> – Each value exchange needs one or more capabilities to
                deliver and capture value. Identify the capabilities that <u>directly</u> support the Value Exchange. The
                rules described in Section 6, Validation and Verification, can help to identify and properly describe the
                capabilities.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the Internally Focused Capabilities: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identify the <i>Internally Focused Capabilities</i> – Identify all of the capabilities that are needed to
                deliver the <i>Externally Focused Capabilities</i>. As stated above, use the rules from Section 6 to help.
            </li>
            <li>
                Evaluate previously defined capabilities to see if they support more than one Value Net Player category.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify capabilities that “fill in the gaps.” Since, by definition, capabilities are all linked together
                in a network of supporting relationships, some gaps may exist at this point in the analysis. For example, a
                capability to source product would probably not be linked directly to a marketing capability. It would
                require some manufacturing capabilities in-between.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the rules in Section 6 to assist in identifying these capabilities.<br />
                The capability model illustration (Figure 3) can help to capture and focus step 2.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <b><u>Step 3: Identify linkages between internal and external capabilities and between external capabilities and value
    net player segments</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    The linkages in the capability Model represent the relationships between a capability and segment (through a value
    proposition), <i>Externally Focused Capabilities</i>, and between a capability and another capability, <i>Internally
    Focused Capabilities</i>. This relationship can be categorized as strong, weak or even conflicting. The step can be
    broken down as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify linkages 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Between <i>Externally Focused Capabilities</i> and Segments (via Value Exchange).
            </li>
            <li>
                Between Capabilities.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Categorize linkages 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Strong - A <b><i>strong</i></b> supporting relationship is one that is <i><u>essential</u></i> to the
                output of the supported Capability or Value Proposition.
            </li>
            <li>
                Weak - A <b><i>weak</i></b> supporting relationship is seen as having a positive impact on the supported
                Capability or Value Proposition, but <i><u>not essential</u></i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conflicting - A <b><i>conflicting</i></b> relationship is one that actually <i><u>degrades the
                performance</u></i> of the supported capability or value proposition. For example, the capability, “Ability
                to find low prices by switching suppliers,” will diminish the capability, “Ability to build close
                relationships with suppliers.”
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Review and repeat as necessary
    </li>
    <li>
        Create “As-is” Capability Model from previously documented linkages<br />
        Tabular – Create a table that identifies all of the linkages and their categorizations as shown in Figure 5
    </li>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    It is usually helpful to focus on the strong and conflicting linkages during the assessment, especially if time is
    limited. In addition, the degree of linkage identification and categorization should be considered in Step 1 when
    refining and clarifying the Focus Definition for the assessment.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <b><u>Step 4: Assess capabilities by customer segment</u></b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    The assessment consists of three criteria – capability gaps, capability performance and capability importance. The gaps
    represent capabilities that the firm does not possess internally or externally through partnerships or alliances, but
    are needed to deliver and capture sustainable value. Performance is how well the capability is doing in relation to the
    supported capabilities or value propositions. Importance is how vital are the relationships (linkages) between the
    capability (or missing capability in the case of a capability gap) and the supported capabilities or value
    propositions.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Note, however, that these assessments are based upon the current environmental, industry and firm contexts. A change in
    the external or internal context may change the performance, importance or need for a currently non-existent capability
    (gap).<br />
    This analysis is performed by segment since a capability may have drastically different ratings across supported
    segments.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    The step can be broken down as follows:
</p>
<ul>

                evaluated are comparable. Getting quantitative information on performance indicators may be difficult. In
                these cases, use qualitative and best practices information. Sources of information could be secondary
                research and/or interviews with the customers on how they view the performance of the organization vis a
                vis the competitors on parameters that are of importance to them.
