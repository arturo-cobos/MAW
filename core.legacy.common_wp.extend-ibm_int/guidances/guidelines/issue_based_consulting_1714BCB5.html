    <strong>CONSULTING AS A PROBLEM -SOLVING PROCESS - Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Client problems presented to consultants demand incisive thought, clear analysis and creativity combined with an
    economy of effort. The Issue-Based Consulting process, which has been adopted by IBM Consulting and has, proven to be
    the most effective in addressing client issues. The fundamental process activity is the postulating of the possible
    elements of the end result that would effectively address the clients problem or ‘issue’ and then carefully plan to
    investigate and prove/disprove the postulations or ‘hypotheses’.&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting with hypotheses provide:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unifying concepts for engagement<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A point of departure for working backward to establish plans for fact gathering and analysis<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A reference point for identifying and assessing the impact of shifts in the focus of the project<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A basis for setting project team priorities
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Our ‘Issue-Based Consulting Process’ combined with the analytical and creative consultant problem solving skills has
    proven to be very effective in the development of high quality solutions to address client needs.

    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>THE FIVE STAGE CONSULTING PROCESS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step one: Definition</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The commitment to the client and the scope of the engagement is defined through client discussions and a high level
    preliminary investigation of identified client issues. Typically the client wants to move from his present ‘As is’
    state to a better future ‘To be’ state. The movement to the better ‘To be’ state is bounded by specific client criteria
    such as budget constraints, deadlines, business outlook, etc. These preliminary investigations must answer a critical
    question at this stage: ‘What does the client want to happen as a result of the engagement?” The results of these
    discussions is a proposal which frames the objectives and issues to be investigated in the engagement. The clear
    definition of the client objectives and issues will enable a smooth transition from the sale of the engagement to its
    delivery.<br />
    <strong>&nbsp;<br />
    Step two: Structure</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The structuring stage of the process is the most critical of the process. In this stage the investigative thinking for
    the engagement is set. To begin this step the delivery team should study the proposal and identify the client’s
    objectives and issues which will be the focus of the engagement. In addition to the proposal the engagement team should
    also review secondary sources of client objectives and issues such as other consultants who have worked or currently
    working at client, industry publications, client correspondence, etc. Using this information as input, an issue diagram
    is created by the engagement team in a workshop conducted by project leader. The issue diagram relates client
    objectives and issues in a hierarchical manner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue diagram serves to bound the scope of the
    engagement and guide the fact gathering effort as depicted in figure 3.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="521" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/issue_based_consulting_fig3.JPG" width="600" /><br />
    <br />
    <strong>Figure 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to issues, the issue diagrams include hypotheses, key questions and data specifications, which are also
    developed by engagement team. Hypotheses may define possible opportunities or potential problems. In consulting a
    hypotheses is defined as a tentative conclusion about an issue to be resolved or an opportunity to be developed. These
    hypotheses are a set of provisional conjectures to shape the investigation (working hypothesis).&nbsp; The engagement
    team, in a workshop setting, should generate all possible hypotheses for each issue based on a variety of sources such
    as previous experience from similar engagements, the engagement proposal, planning meetings, general experience,
    industry publications, etc.&nbsp; The list of hypotheses should then be refined based on relevance, testability and
    specificity. For each hypothesis a set of key questions, which when answered proves, modifies or disproves the
    hypothesis should be generated. (See figure 6 example)<br />
    In addition, at this point a preliminary storyboard of the final report should be developed using the hypotheses as
    placeholders for headlines. (Please see Report Creation technique paper for further information.)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step three: Data Gathering</strong>
</p>
<p>
    With hypotheses and key questions defined in the issue diagram you must now consider how to gather the information
    necessary to address each issue and test each hypothesis. Ideally we want to gather only those facts which are relevant
    to the issues and hypotheses. The data gathering process is divided into 4 stages:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Define/refine data needs<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Plan data gathering strategy<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Gather Data<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarize and cross check
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <img height="443" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/issue_based_consulting_fig4.JPG" width="531" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Define/Refine Data Needs</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To most efficiently identify the data needs and the sources to test the hypotheses the engagement team should first
    develop a set of straw man templates to depict detail data necessary to support preliminary hypothesis headlines. Next
    using the issue diagram and the straw man templates the engagement team should create a data matrix as depicted in
    figure 4. The data matrix is used to clearly identify data requirements and their sources.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Plan Data Gathering Strategy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once the data matrix is established the team must determine the strategy for gathering the data such as the use of
    interviews vs. focus groups or internal sources vs. market data. Figure 5 depicts the data gathering strategy
    considerations<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    <strong><img height="552" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/issue_based_consulting_fig5.JPG" width="600" /></strong>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    Figure 6</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Data Gather</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once the data gathering strategy has been developed data collection can begin after the appropriate preparation has
    been completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The preparation includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scheduling interviews, focus groups<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Reviewing background information<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Preparing interview guide
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As information is gathered it should be classified as a fact, finding, opinion or observation.
</p>
<p>
    Summarize and Cross Check
</p>
<p>
    As the engagement team gathers and summarizes data they should cross check the data and revisit the first steps of
    process by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Comparing evolving story board with issue diagram and data matrices<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify critical and new data needs, weak spots, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine alternate data formats if data not available in preferred format<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Pursue data from additional sources to confirm/check controversial or critical data
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As part of the data collection process it is vital that a system for organizing, storing and retrieving data is
    deployed at the beginning of this process. To assist in the development and data management of issues, hypotheses and
    questions the SCI Issue Analyzer Tool has been developed. For further information regarding this tool please review SCI
    Issue Analyzer Tool Guide technique paper.

<h3>
    Education
</h3>
<p>
    Before using Issue-Based consulting in a client engagement we recommend that you attend either PCW - Professional
    Consulting Workshop or XPCW - Experienced Professional Consulting Workshop to obtain a complete education on
    issue-based consulting.<br />
