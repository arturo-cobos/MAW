    Development of the Strategic Fit Assessment work product is based on existing definitions and analysis of market
    drivers, internal capabilities, corporate strategy and proposed initiatives. These findings and conclusions are either
    outcomes of the other work products developed as a part of the same engagement or are already documented in existing
    client files as a result of a prior work commissioned or internally conducted by the client. If assessment components
    are being developed as a part of the same engagement the following is a list of main categories of work products
    providing input and/or relevant to this work product:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The business environment, drivers, customers wants and needs, market and value chain position are based on outputs
        defined by Business Strategy Analysis: Environment work products.
    </li>
    <li>
        The enterprise resources, capabilities and activities are based on outputs defined by Business Strategy Analysis:
        Capability work products.
    </li>
    <li>
        The enterprise strategy definition is based on outputs defined by the Business Strategy Definition: Formulate and
        Operationalize Strategy work products. Outputs of the above work products can be used as a whole or in a
        combination of parts depending on the scope of the engagement and client preferences.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the purpose of the Strategic Fit Assessment is to examine alignment between initiative(s) and the business strategy
    the enterprise strategy is usually already defined. It is recommend however, to review or validate the strategy prior
    to conducting the fit assessment to ensure that the strategy is up to date and that it is commonly interpreted and
    understood by the project participants: IBM as well as the client team. The approach to validate the enterprise
    strategy is defined in the Transition Initiatives work product.
</p>
<p>
    Upon collecting and validating the base information the team has to construct the dependency diagrams depicting
    relationships between the elements. It is intended to visualize dependencies between elements and the strength of
    support or influence they exercise. Note that the fit between the components, particularly in the capabilities area of
    the assessment, can be categorized using three types of “fit” as defined by Michael Porter in article “What is
    Strategy.”&nbsp; The Porter’s types of “fit” are as follows: Consistency (First-order Fit), Reinforcement (Second-order
    fit) and Optimization (Third-order fit).
</p>
<p>
    The diagrams tend to have a hierarchical structure with various arrow connections indicating strength and relevance of
    the dependency. On the typical business strategy engagement there is a need to develop several dependencies diagrams to
    examine all relevant aspects of the strategy. Their graphic nature allowing fit assessment “at a glance” makes them the
    preferred method to identify misalignment of the strategy. However, depending on complexity of the engagement and the
    client preferences instead of the diagrams the team can use tables with appropriate drivers and components in columns
    and strategic objectives in rows, or vice versa. Tables are often used to capture correlation between vision, mission,
    goals CSFs and measurements.
</p>
<p>
    The identified misalignments together with the high level postulates addressing them are then described in the
    narrative section of the analysis.
