        </div>
    </li>
</ol><strong>Identify and Understand Current Client Approach to Program Management and Performance Measurement</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Before you develop a Program Framework, you must first know what exists. The organization may already have a method or
    strategy for achieving its desired transformation. It is important to complete this task with the client sponsor(s) in
    order to understand how they envision success and the transformation methods they have used in the past.<br />
    You must also understand the current performance management system in place for the client. You will be linking to this
    system, so it is important to know how people and systems are measured. Keep in mind that some organizations or
    departments may have very little in the way of formal performance measurement. Others may have complicated and poorly
    understood or implemented systems.
</p><strong>Agree on Scorecard and Success Criteria for Transformation</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    The success criteria or goals are the outcomes or results that the organization wants to achieve. They must be agreed
    upon or developed with your executive sponsor(s). They should be measurable and actionable and should cascade
    throughout the organization. IBM uses the Balanced Scorecard approach to help define these goals. The Balanced
    Scorecard defines goals and measurement from four perspectives:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Financial Perspective: How do we look to shareholders? (ROI, cash flow)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Customer/Client Perspective: How do customers/clients see us? (quality, services)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Internal Business Perspective: What must we excel at? (cycle time, productivity)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Innovation and Learning Perspective: Can we continue to improve and create value? (new products, improved
            efficiency)
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
    Make sure when you are developing the goals for the transformation that these goals can be cascaded, for example, from
    organization to department to team to individual.

<strong>Match Appropriate Goals and Success Criteria to Current Performance Measurement Systems</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Based on your understanding of the existing performance management system from Step 1 and the goals and success
    criteria developed in Step 2, you must now link those goals into the performance management system in order to
    encourage individuals, teams, and departments to achieve their success measures and to reward them for doing so. See
    tools above.
</p><strong>Design and Enhance Performance Management Framework</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Based on your understanding of the existing program management framework from Step 1 and output from the integrated
    transition plan, you must now design or enhance the existing framework for managing the overall program. When there are
    multiple projects happening concurrently, it is extremely important to have one coordinated and organized framework in
    place to make sure there is consistency and efficiency across the program. IBM uses the Program Office tool (insert
    link here) to produce one document that includes:

<strong>Implement Program Management and Measurement Approaches</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    The new framework and measurement criteria need to be implemented according to the Integrated Transition Plan. Make
    sure you consider who you need to complete the program and what you need in terms of space and supplies.<br />
    In communicating the changes to the program management goals and success criteria, keep in mind that people can help
    the transformation succeed only if they understand what the objectives are. Work closely with the communications team
    for these announcements.<br />
    Consider the role of incentives or other motivational programs to promote awareness and interest in change activities.
</p><strong>Monitor and Revise</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    This work product should be continually monitored and changed as appropriate, but keep in mind that the framework
    should not be changed repeatedly as the goal is to create consistency for the transition program.
