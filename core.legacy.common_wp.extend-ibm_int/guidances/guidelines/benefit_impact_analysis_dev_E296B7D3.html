    <a><b>Step 1: Define the Success Indicators from the Five Strategic Perspectives</b></a>
</p>
<p>
    This first step in the Benefit Impact Analysis is the most crucial to ensuring the overall success of the project and
    the solution’s measurable impact on the business. During the typical requirements analysis phase of a project, many
    functional and nonfunctional systems requirements for the solution are identified without much rationale offered as to
    the overriding business or user performance needs.
</p>
<p>
    This step involves collecting and categorizing “success indicators” from five interrelated, strategic perspectives:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Business performance
    </li>
    <li>
        Job/task performance
    </li>
    <li>
        Training and user support
    </li>
    <li>
        Usability
    </li>
    <li>
        Technology and implementation
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Methods for identifying the success indicators from these five strategic perspectives may include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Review key business documents (e.g., annual report, strategic business plans, training program plans).
    </li>
    <li>
        Interview key stakeholders from different divisions/departments within the organization (executive, operations,
        finance, information systems, human resource development, training, technical support).
    </li>
    <li>
        Interview managers and end user representatives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct/review related market analyses.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The five strategic perspectives are critical to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Quantify costs and benefits within a convenient benchmark matrix.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the necessary components of a winning solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Predict and demonstrate the solution’s successful impact on business and individual performance.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note: It is crucial to identify and categorize success indicators for each of the five strategic perspectives to
    complete the remaining steps in the Benefit Impact Analysis. The resulting success indicators will not only serve as a
    checklist for the customer, but will also help the development team define and scope a successful solution that can be
    managed to successful implementation and rollout.
</p>
<p>
    <a><b>Step 2: Identify and Capture the <i>Current</i> and <i>Targeted</i> “Costs Of Doing Business,” or Benchmark
    Measures</b></a>
</p>
<p>
    Using the list of success indicators as a guide, determine the relevant quantifiable measures of doing business that
    must be addressed by the solution, and capture them in the benchmark matrix as current and targeted measures. The
    targeted measures can be projected over predetermined intervals, such as 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years.
</p>
<p>
    To help identify and quantify relevant current and targeted measures, analyze the success indicators in terms of
    costs/measures related to people, productivity, and environment. These measures translate into “costs” and “benefits”
    to be targeted by the solution as well as contribute to calculating the ROI of the solution, when appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    <a><b>Step 3: Define the Targeted <i>Benefits</i> (Both Qualitative and Quantitative) of the Solution</b></a>
</p>
<p>
    For the success indicators identified in Step 1 and the benchmark measures identified in Step 2, define the relevant
    targeted benefits in measures and terms that are meaningful to the client. The benefits measures typically represent a
    change from the current to the targeted measures identified in Step 2. If predefined target intervals are included, the
    benefits measures would be stated as the change from the current to targeted measure 1 and the change from the current
    to targeted measure 2 (targeted benefit for Year 1 and Year 2).
</p>
<p>
    <a><b>Step 4: Define the Solution and Calculate the Costs of the Solution</b></a>
</p>
<p>
    Use the success indicators within the five strategic perspectives and the benchmark matrix to determine all the
    necessary components for the best solution. While most costs for the solution components may be reflected as project
    costs, some costs, such as hardware or training, for example, may be amortized over predetermined intervals. Defining
    the project plan and costs is covered in several work products.
</p>
<p>
    <a><b>Step 5: Complete the Benefit Impact Analysis</b></a>
</p>
<p>
    Complete the Benefit Impact Analysis to quantify either the predicted success, or impact, of the solution and/or the
    actual success, or impact, of the solution. The Benefit Impact Analysis report may include any or all of the following
    components from the Benefit Impact Analysis project workbook, as appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Success indicators from the five strategic perspectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Benchmark measures matrix.
    </li>
    <li>
        Benefits analysis with optional calculated ROI, when appropriate.
    </li>
