    <a>The following are the major activities in producing Classified Business Terms:</a>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Gathering information sources
    </li>
    <li>
        Extracting business terms
    </li>
    <li>
        Building a glossary (optional)
    </li>
    <li>
        Classifying terms
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The first activity is gathering information sources that provide examples of business terms to be analyzed. One method
    is to develop sources proactively via interviews, facilitated sessions, and questionnaires. The advantage of such
    proactive, interactive techniques is that they involve people from the business. This fosters discussion, raises
    issues, and moves the group toward consensus. However, these methods are time consuming and impose time demands on
    people who are undoubtedly already overworked. More importantly, they rely on the memory and biases of a small group of
    individuals, who are asked to provide all relevant information.
</p>
<p>
    Another technique is to use “found” sources of business information. Found sources are documents and other materials
    produced by the business for its own use. These often prove to be the best sources of raw material for models. In many
    cases, the material is not raw at all but already quite refined, worked over by many business people to express the way
    the business is to be run. These documents range from public statements to sensitive, proprietary information and from
    formal to personal and ad hoc. Good sources of business terminology include: product specifications, catalogs, training
    materials, legal filings, methods and procedures documents, forms, charts of accounts, requirements documents, systems
    documents, business plans, organization charts, existing business process models, contracts, and mission and vision
    statements. One good source is any requirements documentation that the client has produced for the specific engagement.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever the sources, the basic process of creating the Classified Business Terms work product is to identify and
    extract business terms and record them in a classification table as shown in the example. This is a way to identify the
    basic roles and processes of the business, along with the other things of interest.
</p>
<p>
    As sources of information are located, the extraction process can begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraction process is one of
    the identifying terms that may be important or meaningful to the business. This largely consists of removing those
    parts of the text that are simply part of normal, everyday use of language and leaving behind those chunks of text that
    seem to have special meaning in the context of this particular business area.
</p>
<p>
    An optional step in the creation of Classified Business Terms is to create a glossary with dictionary style
    definitions. This is a time-consuming task, and the approach recommended here generates a large number of terms and
    variations on terms. It is often not cost effective to define them all. This is especially true since definitions often
    tend to be circular, defining one term via use of other terms in the list. The process of wordsmithing definitions is a
    time-consuming process. There are usually existing glossaries that the business has created for its own purposes. These
    are excellent sources of terms for the Classified Business Terms work product.
</p>
<p>
    During the process of extracting, defining, and classifying the terms from the business area, additional
    domain-specific concepts will emerge. These need to be added to the classification table as a way of creating finer
    degrees of classification and creating a more refined set of models of the business. An example of this kind of
    refinement came from a project performed for a resort time-share exchange business. This business acted as the broker
    for condominium time-share owners to exchange access time in one location for equivalently valued time in another
    location. These exchanges were explicitly not valued in monetary terms to avoid tax consequences for the owners. There
    were a large variety of terms related to this part of the business (week, vacation, red time, etc.). The concept of
    “barter value” was added to the classification scheme since the concept of “monetary resource” could not be used.
