    The Process Benchmarks work product can be developed with the following steps:
</p>
<p>
    1. Identify a process that has to be benchmarked.
</p>
<p>
    2. Identify aspects of the process that could be benchmarked and select or define related measurements.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Which aspects of the process should be benchmarked could be derived from the business measures that currently are
    already being tracked or from interviews and workshops to be conducted with business managers and workers in the
    process itself or in related processes. Furthermore suggestions for measurents could be derived form success stories in
    publications and, last but not least, the organizations joining in the benchmark could have suggestions as well.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    3. Identify and invite organizations against which a benchmark on this process would be useful and feasible.
</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            he benchmark is useful if it is against organizations in the same or other industry segments carrying out a
            comparable process, preferably in a way that is considered as “best-in-class”, for example,
        </li>
        <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Competitors,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Companies that have won quality/business awards,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recognized industry leaders and companies with superior financial results,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Companies about which success stories were published,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Companies about which you received feedback from internal and external experts, clients, suppliers or
                    business partners, and,&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Internal organizations which carry out the same value-added processes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The benchmark with a specific organization is feasible if the the client will be able to reach that
            organization and will be able to get it supportive to the benchmark, for example by,
        </li>
        <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Common interest in the benchmark results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Good contacts at executive level.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">
    4. Measure the client’s current performance with respect to the chosen measurements.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    5. Undertake performance comparisons between the organizations that join in the benchmark.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    6. Analyze the reasons behind the performance differences by doing a gap-analysis between the client and the
    best-in-class organization for the compared aspects of the process.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p dir="ltr">
        This is a real detailed analysis. It will require contacts with managers and workers in both the client’s and the
        best-in-class organization, which is not necessarily the same organization for each of the aspects of the
        benchmarked business process. Moreover, because of likely differences in the process for different kinds of
        commodities, it probably has to be executed at commodity group level. The analysis should clarify how the specific
        activity is organized and conducted in both the client’s and the best-in-class’ organization and why and how the
        best-in-class process gets to the better performance.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
        Be aware of differences that originate from the business itself, specifically if the benchmarked organizations are
        not operating in the same industry.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    7. Define, based upon the results from the gap-analysis and the client’s ability to change, potential process
    improvement actions that might be taken to narrow the gaps.
</p>
<p>
    8. Propose, in line with the defined potential process improvement actions, redefined goals and future targets for the
    chosen measurements. The future targets can be spread out across time to show incremental benefits over a longer
    period.
</p>
<p>
    It will not always be necessary to spend much effort on the steps 2 and 3 in above list. For several business processes
    success stories about best-in-class performers are published regularly in special literature and on Internet. A
    benchmark then can be simplified by just using the performance measurements of the best-in-class organization to
    compare the client’s process to that ‘best-in-class’ and the real effort can be spent in steps 6, 7 and 8.<br />
