    <strong>Consider Buyer Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first step in the process is to identify buyers’ propensities to use specific channels. The company might begin by
    evaluating its existing channels and reviewing how customers are interacting with the company. However, channel
    strategy is not about just understanding status quo. Management should view this process as one of identifying
    strengths and weaknesses in its current channels and determining how it can leverage its strengths in new channels to
    differentiate the company and to enhance the perceived value that buyers receive.
</p>
<p>
    The first question is, “Why are buyers using these channels?” Although many management teams are confident that they
    are thinking carefully about these issues, in most cases, they are not asking more than, “What buyers are using these
    channels?” The key question is, “Why?”.
</p>
<p>
    “Why do buyers use these channels?”
</p>
<p>
    “Why are they loyal to one channel over another?”
</p>
<p>
    “How do they perceive channels as being different from each other?”
</p>
<p>
    In order to answer these questions, management must develop a deeper understanding of buyer behavior and the
    underpinnings of buyer preferences. Organizations can establish processes and build cultures that will help them
    develop buyer understanding. They can design customer interfaces to gather information; they can emphasize the
    importance of channel choice; and they can establish knowledge management systems to capture customer insights
    regarding channels. Many firms rely on market research specialists to help them understand the more complex, subtle
    drivers that shape buyer behavior. Third parties bring objectivity and expertise in probing for attitudes and brand
    associations. Successful companies integrate this knowledge with their own systems to continually enhance their
    understanding of the relationship between channels and buyers.<br />
    Technology has begun to shape buyer behavior as never before. With the broad acceptance of such digital technologies as
    WAP, PDA, iTV, etc., buyers are free to move effortlessly among channels and to information is available in multiple
    channels to help them make their buying decisions.&nbsp; For example, consider the change in buying behavior and the
    information that’s available to a consumer standing in a retail store, considering the purchase of a CD player,
    simultaneously seeking alternatives to the retail offering over the wireless web.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Assess the Strengths and Weaknesses of Channels</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As the company builds its understanding of buyers, it should evaluate the channels closely regarding alignment in two
    key areas. First, is the channel aligned with the needs of the company’s target audience? Second, are the company’s
    strengths aligned with those of the channel? If mismatches appear, then management needs to consider placing emphasis
    on new channels or shifting tactics within current channels.<br />
    The key is to view channels as dynamic paths to market rather than static realities that must be accepted as they
    exist. If a channel is failing to meet the needs of customers, then managers must alter relationships with channel
    partners or abandon the channel for another. The company must also ensure that its own operations are designed for
    optimal functioning within the channels.&nbsp; In addition, the management team must identify which products and
    services will be made available over which channels, considering strengths and weaknesses in such matters as
    warehousing quality, transportation schedules, and presentation to buyers.
</p>
<p>
    Some companies prefer to have separate channels for specific customer segments, not allowing their customers to cross
    over between channels. However, the demand for an integrated approach is rendering such an approach far less tenable.
    As a result, management should also evaluate the integration of communications and logistics across channels. Retailers
    deal with this issue every day in Web space, as they learn more about how the “click” channel can support the “brick”
    channel and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
    In the end, the strength or weakness of any channel is relevant only to the extent that it permits the company to
    leverage its own strengths. Management should decide which of its company’s strengths it is attempting to leverage
    through the channel. Is it the brand? Is it logistical capability? Quality products? Cost structures? Addressing this
    issue will enable management to maneuver far more effectively within the channel.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Consider Communication through Channels</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Historically, marketing decision-makers found the value in the channel to be primarily based on logistics…moving
    inventory from one place to another. That has long since changed to a situation where much of the value in the channel
    lies in the information shared among the members of the channel—marketing, logistical and economic information.
    Management should ensure that it is taking advantage of communications innovations within the channel and watching for
    security breaches.
</p>
<p>
    Successful channel managers understand the critical role of communication played within the channel. Those responsible
    for building product lines and brands use the channel as a vehicle for listening to buyers and other channel members.
    They also use it as a means to disseminate the company’s own messages.
</p>
<p>
    Each member of the channel must express its own standards for service. These standards apply to interactions among
    channel members and between the channel members and customers. As channels grow more complex, the channel members must
    work more closely together to create a positive experience for buyers, delineating such matters as acceptable response
    times, quality, and support. The endgame is customer loyalty - loyalty to the channel as well as to any given product
    or brand within the channel.
</p>
<p>
    Different management teams will vary in their capacity to operate successfully in multiple channels. In general, this
    capability is a positive attribute as one can see the strengths and weaknesses of various channels as well as grow
    revenues from the wider exposure through multiple channels. In this case, management must keep an eye on the buyer
    experience that is expected from each channel. People have chosen a channel for a reason. If they have chosen Channel
    A, they do not want to be treated as though they had chosen Channel B.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Understand Channel Conflict</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Channel conflict is a positive sign that a company is pushing to maximize its position in the market. Successful
    management teams understand this reality and work through it.<br />
    One technique for thinking about channel conflict is to determine which side of the conflict the company would take, if
    forced. Such an ongoing analysis will help managers navigate conflict issues, although they are well advised to keep
    these determinations highly confidential. The answer is usually not critical in the short run; but in the long run,
    channel conflict often has strategic implications.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Analyze Channel Economics</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The relationships between companies and customers have changed significantly during recent years. Customers have vast
    new sources of information that enable them to make smarter choices and demand better service. Customers have also
    become more comfortable with switching between brands. As the challenge to maintain long-term relationships with
    increasingly smart, mobile and switch-prone customers grows, the roles of channels become more important. Each member
    in the channel has an economic incentive to contribute to the one major force in customer retention…transaction
    experience. As timeframes shorten, quality demands soar and choices proliferate, all of the channel members must work
    together to build the customer loyalty that leads to long-term profitability.
</p>
<p>
    Marketing decision-makers are beginning to look closely at both “life time” revenue streams and “life cycle” revenue
    streams. In the former, they are considering how they can retain a given profitable customer over a lifetime with
    regard to a fairly well defined product line or brand. In the latter, they are looking at providing completely
    different products or brands over time, based on the customer’s personal life cycle. For example, a person aged 80
    likely wants different things than a person aged 40. Companies are not designed optimally to offer too wide an array of
    goods and services; channels have more flexibility. As markets become increasingly focused on meeting the needs of
    individual customers, channels will play a larger economic role.
</p>
<p>
    Management teams should carefully review the financial results of each channel once or twice a year. Just as companies
    manage brands, product lines, divisions and departments to a bottom line, they should also manage channels as tangible,
    measurable business endeavors.&nbsp; Following are some aspects of financial results that companies should consider:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What are the revenues generated through each channel?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What portions of total company revenues are generated through each channel?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the pricing strategies of channel members? This includes channel partners and competitors in the channel.
        How do pricing strategies differ in different channels? Are some channels charging premiums over other channels?
        How?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the costs of doing business in each channel?&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Can we effectively apply activity-based costing to determine profitability in multiple channels?&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the return on investment within each channel?&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What techniques might we apply to cause customers to migrate from a less profitable channel to a more profitable
        channel? Would this require more than economic incentives? For example, a major promotional effort.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Who are the largest channel partners?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the economics of those relationships?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What is one new channel we might consider using? Why would we? Why would we avoid it?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Consider Channel Control</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Management teams should carefully consider their choices regarding vertical and horizontal integration. While the terms
    are generally widely understood, they are less often applied within the context of channels. Managers need to decide
    just how much of the channel they want to control directly (vertical) and how much they want to delegate to channel
    partners (horizontal). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. More control can lead to higher margins and
    better transaction experiences for customers, but a greater cost per transaction. Less control can lead to faster
    growth and greater flexibility through such vehicles as franchising, broad alliances and wide-reaching distribution
    agreements.&nbsp; The challenges here are quality control and channel conflict – sometimes allies will compete for
    channel space.<br />
