    The following are the high level steps for developing Job, Roles, Responsibilities and Competencies;
</p>
<p>
    1. Review current jobs<br />
    2. Determine tasks to be performed in the future<br />
    3. Design new job roles and responsibilities<br />
    4. Validate design feasibility<br />
    5. Document and review with client
</p>
<p>
    The steps above should yield formatted job descriptions and documentation of enablers required for successful
    implementation.&nbsp; In addition to these deliverables is a client report. It should revisit the purpose of the
    initiative and articulate how the job designs will contribute to achieving the project’s intended business outcomes.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Note: Most of the tools listed below apply to more than one step.</b>
</p><strong>Review Current Jobs</strong> 
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Review the future organization scope and requirements to identify the jobs in scope. The client is likely have
            an existing set of job descriptions that outlines at least the basic tasks performed in the affected jobs. Work
            with the human resources department to understand how current and accurate these descriptions are, and whether
            any additional information should be gathered. Some information can also be gathered from the current
            organization description and current organization assessment. If necessary, update them to reflect changes
            since their completion. These work products may also provide insight into the client’s culture (how it
            typically approaches and responds to job change), and whether employees are unionized.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            In the absence of either of these sources, create a template to inventory existing job tasks. Identify a
            representative sample of people in each job to fill out the template. Try to involve those whose performance is
            considered outstanding. Compile the information.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol><strong>Determine Tasks to Be Performed in the Future</strong> 
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Prepare a list of all tasks needed to execute the future business processes. Obtain information about the new
            processes and the tasks and roles that make them up. Some current tasks may still be needed in the future,
            while others that are done today may no longer be needed.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Also identify the information requirements for each task, including whether access to data should be read-only
            or whether authorization to update data is required.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol><strong>Design New Job Roles and Responsibilities</strong> 
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Collaborate with a small client team to design new job roles, responsibilities, and competencies. It is
            important to involve the human resources or organization development department and take into account the
            client’s usual approach to job design. These client team members can also ensure that the job redesign is
            consistent with and supported by HR policies (particularly in respect to job levels, compensation, benefits,
            etc.).
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The future organization design will illustrate at a very high level how some of the process activities should
            be clustered into jobs. This work product will refine that high-level model. The design points used for the
            organization redesign will also apply to job design. In the absence of organization redesign and design points,
            work from an existing set of design principles that are based on research and IBM Consulting Group experience
            (available on ICM AssetWeb and listed in the tools section below).
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A workshop setting is most effective in developing job designs. It also helps with building buy-in to the task
            of defining the level of detail that the design should have.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Allocate the tasks (as determined in Step 2) to define the future job roles. The graphic below illustrates the
            building blocks of a job design.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol><br />

<br />
<div>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next enrich the role definition to cover the following categories:
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Work
    tasks/responsibilities ("perform the task") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-
    Accountabilities ("own the task") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Objectives
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Competencies
    required &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Behaviors
    that should be demonstrated within the role &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Measurements
    for role performance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Security
    authorizations required for access to date &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These should be documented within the client’s standard job
    description format, unless it does not adequately define the roles; if it
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not, a revised template will need to be developed.
</div>
<div>
    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Group jobs with the same security requirements into profiles. The same profile may apply to
    multiple jobs. Profiles will simplify the&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; structure of the security trees in any information technology applications
    used in job roles.
</div>
<div>
    7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next define any changes to the management system that would be required to support the new
    designs (often referred to in
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organization Change intellectual capital as "structural enablers"). Some
    examples are: HR practices, compensation programs,
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; performance evaluation, skills management, career planning, hiring strategy,
    security strategy, recognition, and incentives. The
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; physical environment, such as office layout and equipment, may also need to
    be changed.<br />
    8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also consider the implications that implementing the new job designs might have for the
    organization transition plan, and document
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them.
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Validate Design Feasibility</strong><br />
</p>
<div>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check for consistency in the mapping of tasks to jobs. Ensure that the design does not
    produce unnecessary overlap or process
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inefficiencies.
</div>
<div>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revisit the design points and evaluate how well the new designs meet them. Some refinement
    may be required as a result of this test.
</div>
<div>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authority levels are an important business control. Review security profiles and look for
    consistency between the work being performed
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and access to data. Test them on a wide variety of job titles. If the
    profiles have been designed well, the number of profiles should not
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grow.
</div>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask yourself whether the job description would give employees a clear understanding of
their roles and job with respect to: <br />
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        - Organization (team, department, business unit)<br />
        - Processes (that is, contribution as part of the value chain)<br />
        - IT user profile (access to what kind of information, authorizations, responsibilities)<br />
        - Individual contributions, behaviors, measurements, objectives, and outcomes
    </p>
</blockquote>
<div>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A highly recommended approach to validation is to test the designs with an employee
    focus group. Various scenarios or process
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walkthroughs could be used to illustrate the real-life context of the
    job. For example, the job can be modeled in its process context by
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using process modeling tools such as LOVEM (see references).
</div>
<div>
    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because all of these jobs will have to be filled, ensure that the difficulty of doing so has
    been accurately gauged. Review the client’s
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approach to recruitment, selection, in-placement, outplacement, reskilling,
    and severance, and identify any additional
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recommendations that will support implementation of the redesign.
