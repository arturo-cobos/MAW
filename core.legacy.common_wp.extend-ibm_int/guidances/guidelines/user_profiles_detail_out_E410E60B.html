    <b>Overview</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>User Profiles&nbsp;</b>A one-sentence summary <i>definition</i> of the User Profile and attributes for each User
    Profile, each of these user profile attributes has one or more distinguishing elements -- shown in more detail below.
</p>
<p>
    <em>The selection of which attributes to document is a judgment call based on the design team’s opinion about the
    attribute’s applicability to the particular design challenge. We surveyed IBM intellectual capital databases for user
    profiles work product write-ups delivered to clients over the last several years and found that some of these
    attributes and distinguishing elements are more prevalently used than others in the various write-ups. We have denoted
    the more frequently used elements with an asterisk (*) in the sections below.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Prior Knowledge and Experience</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Computer Experience Level*:</b> Prior experience influences users’ learning and use of the new system. You may
        distinguish between novice, intermediate, and expert users. Definitions will vary depending on the context. The
        following definitions are often used:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Novice users have never used a computer system or have limited computer system experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                Intermediate users use a computer system to do their work but on an irregular basis. They are familiar with
                certain aspects of a computer system, such as use of a particular application. Even so, they demand rapid
                response times, brief feedback, and the capacity to carry out actions with just a few keystrokes or
                selections.
            </li>
            <li>
                Expert users are very familiar with computer systems. They also demand rapid response times, brief
                feedback, and the capacity to carry out actions with just a few keystrokes or selections. Often though,
                because they are expert users, they are more likely to be accepting of usability design flaws if the
                computer system provides the functionality they need to better perform their jobs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Existing Computer Skills and Experience*:</b> Relatedly, existing skills and experience influences users’
        learning and use of the new system. These may include the following:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hardware experience (e.g., PC, terminal, mouse, pervasive devices such as PDAs or cell phones, and
                assistive technologies)
            </li>
            <li>
                Applications (e.g., Lotus Notes, Microsft Excel, Microsoft Word, programming languages, programming
                environments, or assistive technologies such as Screen Readers)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Typing/Accessibility Skills*:</b> Ability to use a keyboard, mouse, or other input accessory efficiently may
        help users better manipulate the new system interface. Limitation on typing skills and perhaps the requirement for
        assistive technology (and the experience using the accessibility technology) can impact or alter the use of the new
        system interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Knowledge of the Business Domain*:</b> Users’ understanding of the tasks they will perform using the new system
        will affect their ability to learn and use the new system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Education, Intellectual Abilities, and Skills of the User</b>: Usually, strong intellectual and higher reading
        skills are positively correlated with users’ acceptance of new technology and their ability to learn and use a new
        system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Native Language:</b> Non-native speakers of the language used in the computer system may have difficulty
        learning and using the system. Translations should be employed if the computer system will be used in different
        languages.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Physical Characteristics</b>
</p>
<p>
    The following personal factors should be considered:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Age:</b> User age can play a significant role in guiding design decisions. One well-controlled study found that
        young adults (ages 19 to 36) were reliably different than older adults (ages 64 to 81) across the following
        dimensions: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Young adults:
            </li>
            <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        used ATMs and computers more often,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        read faster,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        had greater reading comprehension and working memory capacity,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        had faster choice reaction times (there was no difference in simple reaction time), and;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        had higher perceptual speed scores than older adults.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Older adults:
            </li>
            <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        were better educated, and;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        had higher vocabulary scores Mead, S.E. and Fisk, A.D. (1997), Effects of matching cognitive and
                        perceptual-motor training to task components on complex task performance by older and younger
                        adults, Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 115-119.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Age also plays a role in vision differences between young and older adults. For example, older
                        adults over the age of 40 often suffer from presbyopia (difficulty in focusing on close items) ,
                        which usually requires corrective lenses, typically for reading. Despite the correction afforded by
                        reading glasses, many older adults with presbypoia still have trouble reading text with small fonts
                        (10 point or less) and lower foreground to background color contrasts (e.g., gray text on a white
                        background) compared to younger adults.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Another study found that:
            </li>
            <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Older users have a more cautious user interaction approach
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Older users spend more time reading text and instructions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Older users click on non-links more often Chadwick-Dias, A. (2002). How age affects user
                        performance on the Web.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Fatigue Factors or Physical Limitations:</b> Fatigue and other physical limitations (e.g., fatigue as a result
        of repetitive tasks such as might be found in a bank teller station or the role of fatigue in a vigilance task,
        such as security monitoring) should be considered when it affects use of a new system, particularly in military
        applications.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Gender:</b> Sometimes gender will be a key attribute in distinguishing user groups, for example, a particular
        job may have requirements about height or strength (e.g., capability to lift 40 pound packages), or may have
        implications for color blindness or deficiency (e.g., seven percent of the American male population—either cannot
        distinguish red from green, or see red and green differently from most people while only 0.4 percent of American
        women have this form of color blindness).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Disabilities*:</b> Such as blindness/low vision, limited/no use of hands or other dexterity issues,
        deafness/hard of hearing: These factors will affect computer use.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Social and Physical Environment</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Organizational Culture:</b> Characteristics of the user’s organization (e.g., organizational climate, mood,
        decision making culture) can affect users work ethic and attitudes about approaching deadlines, decision making)
        and work in general. An organization’s culture regarding pace of work will provide guidance and insight into the
        style of user-interaction that will be valued by the users described in the user profile. For example, a fast-paced
        culture will likely value “power user” aids in the design more so than a culture that has a slower pace of
        work.Organizational culture information is also useful in persona narrative development, since it can set the stage
        for the reader in terms of the environment in which the user works.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Acceptance of Change*:</b> Users who have performed a certain task in the same way for a long time may be
        reluctant to adapt to a new way of working. These users may have to “unlearn” the old way and be encouraged to
        embrace the new way.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Specific Location:</b> Geographical factors (e.g., region or country, urban or rural) can affect system use. For
        example, use of computers in non-technical sectors of the United States has become commonplace, whereas in similar
        sectors of Russia, computers are often less familiar and hence require a more basic interface and more ongoing
        support.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Environment of Use:</b> Relevant characteristics of the environment in which the system is to be used (e.g.,
        dusty, noisy, crowded) can affect how the new system is designed. For example, designing user-interfaces for cash
        registers often must take into account that users will likely be standing, which increases the display viewing
        distance, thereby necessitating the need for larger screen fonts.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Social Interaction Requirements:</b> System and help system design is affected by whether others can view their
        interaction with the system (e.g., face-to-face with customers) or whether interaction is remote (e.g., interaction
        by phone).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Cognitive Characteristics</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Learning Style:</b> Learning styles vary across users and can affect the type of training, support, and
        interface style used in the new system. For example, some users may have a preference for tutorials, while others
        may prefer to learn by trial and error. Others need very structured learning, while others prefer flexibility in
        their learning concurrent with more control over when learning takes place.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Attitude and Expectations:</b> User attitudes and expectations about the introduction of new technology, based
        on past experience, affect learning and acceptance of a new system. For example, the design team will want to have
        insight into whether or not the average user will have had previously poor or good experiences in the roll-out of
        new technology.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Motivational: (Mandatory vs. Discretionary Users):</b> User acceptance of a system is affected by whether the
        user’s use is mandatory or discretionary.
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Discretionary users may use the system to do their work, although it is possible to do that work without
                using a computer, or use another competing application.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mandatory users have no choice but to use the system to do their work.Designing for discretionary users
                requires the design team to be much more aware of “competitive alternatives” to the new design; for example
                the availability of a competing site or alternative channel (such as a call center) when designing a
                self-service web site.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Current Job Characteristics</b><br />
    <br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>High level Responsibilities*</b> - Defines at a high level the user’s current job responsibilities that will
        have an impact on the design of the new system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Roles* -</b> What will be the roles this person have in interacting with the new system. Often there is a one to
        one correspondence with the user and the role that will be performed (e.g., “Teller” for a branch banking teller
        application), but occasionally a user will have not only an end-user role but also an administrator role (e.g., in
        the design of a tax system, an accountant may not only use the tax system to create client tax returns but may also
        have an administrative role by granting other accountants access to the system).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Key Activities (or Tasks)*:</b> Describes the top three to five tasks the person accomplishes with the current
        system or hopes to accomplish with the new system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Productivity Requirements*:</b> Current throughput requirements can help provide guidance on customer
        expectations regarding such factors as number of steps and keystrokes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Other Systems Used Concurrently:</b> Using multiple systems may lead to confusion or enhancement of learning and
        using a new system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Turnover Rate*:</b> Organizational turnover rate can help determine the nature of training and ease of learning
        objectives for the new system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Number of users*:</b> Size of each segment of the user audience will help to determine where to focus the design
        efforts.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Training Users Receive on Systems*:</b> Training affects system use. For example, users that are trained prior
        to working on a new system will behave differently than those who aren’t trained in advance. The degree and type of
        training received also affects system use.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Available Tools and Support Personnel:</b> A user’s use of a new system will be affected by the existence of
        additional tools, support personnel, courses, and other resources. For example, in the brokerage industry, we see
        cases where much of the use of a new brokerage system is conducted by the broker’s assistants in large offices.
        Most users today rely heavily on MS Office applications independent of the solutions we are designing for them.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Goals</b>
</p>
<p>
    User Profiles also document goals that the user wishes to attain in using the new system. In addition, where
    applicable, life goals which may have an impact on user’s motivation or attitudes are also documented. There are three
    main types of goals:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>End Goals*</b>: Focuses on goals that the user has for using the solution, such as completing tasks successfully
        and efficiently.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Experience Goals:</b> Focuses on those experiences a user hopes to derive from using the system. For example, in
        using an online banking site, a user may have experience goals to feel confident that the transaction was secure.
        Experience goals are also often useful for helping “bring to life” the persona narratives .
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Life Goals:</b> Focuses on non-work related goals that nonetheless will have a bearing on the design of the
        system. For example, a department store clerk software application used primarily by college students during
        holiday breaks will require a design focused on enabling the new user (rather than a power user) since turnover is
        high among this particular user profile (because they ostensibly have bigger dreams than making cashiering a
        lifelong vocation).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Personas</b>
</p>
<p>
    If personas are developed, each persona should contain the following information, ideally be no longer than one page,
    and chunked so that it is easy for a reader to scan. (See the examples below)
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Name -</b> Fictitious name for the person.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Photograph -</b> A headshot that represents your persona.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Quote –</b> A pithy sentence that captures the essence of how the persona approaches his or her job <i>(e.g., “I
        am here to keep the office running smoothly”).</i>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Persona type –</b> Primary, secondary, supplemental, or negative (see definitions in Section 5.0 “Development
        Approach” below).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Summary</b> – High-level statements about the persona’s role in the organization, often characterized initially
        in terms of how the persona would be introduced to those that meet him or her for the first time:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                He’s our <i>“The tech guy”.</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                Liz <i>“monitors content updates to the employee portal”.</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                Larry is the <i>“father of our benefits system”</i> .
            </li>
            <li>
                If there is high turnover that you want reflected in a particular persona: Charlotte is <i>“one our new
                call center reps, learning the ropes”</i> or something similar.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
