    The Problem Resolution Report is used throughout the emergency fix and in any subsequent follow-on work.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Performing Immediate Action</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    The Problem Resolution Report is initiated almost as soon as the developer takes ownership of the emergency fix when it
    is used to document the problem impact. After completing the Change/Problem /Date/Time information the Application
    Developer gathers information to assist in determining where the error occurred and creates a Problem Resolution Report
    to keep a record of all significant information, this will include a brief description of the problem.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The Problem Resolution Report is next updated once the Developer has decided upon the changes that have to be made to
    resolve the emergency. In effect this acts as the documented design of solution.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The Problem Resolution Report is next used to record information whilst completing the following tasks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Make System Change Components – Updated to reflect the component changes.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Test Changes – Record test results.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Implemented Changes – Record details of who was contacted to assist in implementing changes, times, etc.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Arrange Production Run/System Restarts - Record details of whom were contacted to assist in implementing
            changes, times, etc.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Problem Resolution Report is then used to record the results from production output and to update it to say who was
    contacted, and any other information that may be necessary for follow-on action to be taken.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>Performing Follow-on Action</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    To perform any follow-on action the developer will need to review the Problem Resolution Report to understand the
    problem. It can then be used to assess the effectiveness of the emergency fix and to record identified Job Log errors,
    Output errors, and System Data errors.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The Problem Resolution Report is then updated when identifying the problem cause. This involves a more thorough
    investigation of the problem than was possible whilst the immediate fix was being implemented. As a result it will be
    possible to determine if any other changes to the system are required and if they are then the Report should be updated
    to say what they are.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Finally during this activity, potential data recovery action should be identified, and if there is any, then what it is
    should be recorded.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The Problem Resolution report is next used to notify appropriate organisations of any follow-on action during the
    following tasks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Where the need for a Software Change Requirement has been identified and is either a separate problem within
            the current system or from another one, then the Developer raises a new Problem Incident Report. This
            information is then noted on the Problem Resolution Report.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            When the original problem has been identified as being a separate problem within the current system or being
            from another one, then the developer should raise a new Problem Incident Report. This information is then noted
            on the Problem Resolution Report
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            When creating appropriate communication, the details of who was contacted in the course of resolving the Fix
            and other information necessary for retrospective action to be taken should be recorded.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Change Record should be noted on the Problem Resolution Report along with closure details of the Problem Incident
    Report.<br />
</p>
<p>
    In order to provide a permanent fix for the problem and ensure that the system runs as it is supposed to, a number of
    tasks have to be completed.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Initially the Problem Resolution Report is used when confirming the scope of the project or work to be undertaken,
    developing a work plan and assigning appropriate resources and assets, when it is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Reviewed to confirm the nature of the problem and what follow on work is required.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Used as an input to enable a work plan to be produced.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The problem is then recreated, reviewed, and the cause of the problem is identified. An assessment of the defects is
    carried out and an impact analysis statement is produced.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;Any temporary programs that were written to assist in these tasks are then removed from the system. The Problem
    Resolution Report is used to both provide and record information associated with this work as defined below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The description of the problem contained within the Problem Resolution Report is used to enable the developer
            to try to recreate the original problem. Any steps or extra resources used are recorded in the Problem
            Resolution Report.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The problem cause recorded in the Problem Resolution Report is reviewed and verified. If the cause is not that
            recorded then the Problem Resolution Report is updated to reflect this.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The emergency fix developer will have recorded the impact of the problem on the system, other systems, and work
            in progress in the Problem Incident Report. This is reviewed and the Problem Resolution Report is updated
            accordingly.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Problem Resolution Report will contain information as to the nature of the problem and what was done about
            it. The developer will check to ensure that there is a problem that does require corrective maintenance. If it
            does not, then a service request is submitted to Program Management for further action.
