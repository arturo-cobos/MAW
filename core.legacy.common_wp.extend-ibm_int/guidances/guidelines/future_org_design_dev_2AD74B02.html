        1. Review existing information
    </p>
    <p>
        Collect and review the current organization description, current organization assessment, future state
        vision/definition, and future organization scope and requirements, and confirm that it is still accurate and
        represents the current agreed approach to the organization design. Put special emphasis on the design points
        defined in the scope and requirements to ensure that they represent the client's desired direction for the
        redesign. If the future state vision/definition and future organization scope and requirements are not available,
        do not proceed with this work product until they or their equivalents have been produced.

        2. Obtain further detailed information
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;Detailed information about roles (including new process roles and new IT roles), current position
        responsibilities, skills, compensation, and organization structure must be gathered for departments that will be
        significantly impacted by the new organization. Before creating a new design, one must have a complete inventory of
        the work done in the current organization, because changes in even one job or department will likely impact others.
        This information will also be crucial to defining the activities required to implement the project successfully in
        a supportive environment.

    <strong>Develop detailed future organization design - STRUCTURE</strong>
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    1. Based upon the design points, design a new organization structure which defines structural elements.&nbsp; Depending
    on the scope, these may include:
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                groupings of new process roles and responsibilities, along with unchanged, existing roles, into new jobs

            </div>
        </li>
        <li>

                groupings of work activities into organizational units, with a mission and recommended name for each
            </div>

            <div>
                staffing levels and spans of control

    </ul>
</div>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Typically the first iteration of the structural design is done at a conceptual level. The conceptual model is like
        the architecture of the organization structure. Most organizational models that IBM consultants have designed are
        hybrids of various "pure" organization models (e.g., functional, geographic, customer- based, etc.). A matrix model
        is a hybrid that is frequently employed in today’s designs. See the tools at the end of this section for detailed
        instruction on various models. Exploring the various models is done in a workshop setting that is designed to allow
        the client team to imagine the alternatives for their organization and test them in "what-if" situations. Once
        consensus is reached among the team on the model, the sponsor’s agreement should be obtained
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The next step is to apply the model to the overall organization at the strategic level. This shows how the
        model, at a high level, encompasses strategic business units, lines of business, functions, outsourced functions,
        business partners, geographies, and executive management groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. This model can then be fleshed out with all the detail. In a large, multi-site redesign, the following sequence
        can be useful: in-scope strategic business units; in-scope functions; lines of business; geography. This sequence
        proceeds from the broader to the narrower of the existing units. Apply the model at each level and figure out what
        the groupings of work activities will be. Be sure to include any outsourced functions and show clearly where the
        linkages to the extended enterprise (alliances, business partners) lie. Also indicate where process leadership and
        management reside in the organization. The design may also include elements that support process in other ways,
        such as centers of competency or cross-functional process teams
    </p>
    <p>
        4. The lowest level of detail is the final step--team design. This may include process teams, other
        cross-functional teams indicated by the model, and project or program teams. When designing, test the new structure
        for its ability to clarify the linkage needed among the teams and their integration with the organization’s
        decision-making and management system

        high-performance organizations--the behavior equivalent of best practice--can provide descriptions of target

            that can be fitted easily into the target culture. For each target behavior, assess the <b>relative</b>
