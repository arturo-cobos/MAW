    The following are the guidelines for developing Performance Management Systems;
</p>
<p>
    1. Identify measures required for organization, divisions, teams, and individual jobs<br />
    2. Design future performance management system<br />
    3. Construct measurement system<br />
    4. Review total reward system<br />
    5. Summarize recommendations and implementation requirements
</p>
<h4>
    Identify Measures Required for Organization, Divisions, Teams, and Individual Jobs
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    To be effective, the system needs to be based on measurements that are relevant to the organization's goals; closely
    related to the jobs performed by individuals and teams; specific, defined, and well understood; and measured. These
    measurements should be identified for all three levels of the organization: enterprise or SBU; team, function,
    department, or team, function, department, and process; and individual.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Enterprise</b> <b>or SBU Level</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If this is part of the engagement, the organization's measures should be developed with its senior management. Draft a
    set of measures with senior management and then review and agree on them in a workshop or series of workshops. Scope
    the measures initially from the organization's strategy, mission, and vision, goals and critical success factors,
    business plans, and key processes.<br />
    Construct these measures using the balanced scorecard approach to show both financial and non-financial measures of
    success and to cover both business-as-usual and the process of change. A default industry standard template that may be
    useful to start with is available on the Business Intelligence database (see Tools).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Team, Function, Department, or Process Level</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Now identify appropriate measures for the remaining levels of the organization. Objectives should cascade down the
    organization, including to the executive team, so that overall goals are reflected in the goals of the departments and
    functions below it, but in greater detail and specificity for each level. Identify the measures in draft and agree to
    them in meetings or workshops with the areas concerned to ensure buy-in. Key sources of information are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Organization-level goals and measures
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Roles defined in the Future Organization Design
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Divisional sub-strategies or plans (e.g., IT strategy, HR strategy)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Critical success factors
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Key processes: where the organization is adopting a process or process matrix structure this will be a
            principal component, but it should be considered in all cases.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Individual Level</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Measures are also needed at the individual level to measure individual performance of roles. Cascading from the team
    and organization level, these will also be derived from, and checked against, the new job descriptions. This process
    may be iterative, ensuring that measures are correctly aligned to the new jobs. Draft the measures with client staff
    and management, and where possible have employee groups review them to ensure buy-in. Key sources of information are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Team-level goals and measures
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Job descriptions

    <li>
        <div>
            Process measures

<h4>
    Design Future Performance Management System
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    The four steps in designing performance management systems are shown in PMGTMDL.PRE under Notation.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Review Existing Performance Management Approaches</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Evaluate existing approaches for completeness and the degree to which they support the organization vision, mission,
    and strategy and the future organization design. This is a review and update of the work started in the Current
    Organization Assessment work product.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Collect performance approach descriptions for the firm and by department, if applicable
        </div>

    <li>
        <div>
            Interview HR resource for clarification and insight into approaches and the client organization's performance
            management philosophy. Clarify the objectives of the transformation from an organizational effectiveness
            perspective.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Conduct employee focus groups, interviews, or surveys with staff from areas affected by the transformation and
            seek input on the operation of the performance management framework in practice. Probe for understanding of the
            extent that employees use the performance management program as required or if ad hoc programs are used
            instead. The Performance Management Questionnaire (PMQ) can be used in this information gathering.

    <li>
        <div>
            Create criteria for the performance management system to complete the evaluation of the current system and

        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Design the Future Performance Management System</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Base the design of the system on the organization's strategy and business priorities, and on the future design
    characteristics and future organization design completed in the Organization Scope and Requirements and Future
    Organization Design work products. The design will need to cover the different kinds of jobs the redesigned
    organization will have, for example call center staff, finance executive, and production staff. Although the details
    for each job family will be specified later, define the overall framework or frameworks to cope with all the job
    families.<br />
    New or revised performance management approaches and processes should be designed and documented, including all four
    elements of the process:

    <b>Identify Gaps</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Identify gaps between existing and desired performance management in each area and identify approach to implement the
    redesigned system.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Implement and Construct a Review Process</b>
</p>
<h4>
    Construct Measurement System
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    Once the measures have been identified and agreed to and the performance management approaches have been defined, it is
    essential to link these to the organization's management information systems and reporting processes to ensure that the
    measures are in place and reported to the appropriate structure. This will depend on the organization's overall
    management system (structure, committees, functions, etc.) that will have been reviewed in the Future Organization
    Design. It may be a separate assignment to revise the management reporting process to reflect the balanced scorecard.
    Implementation will be through the Balanced Scorecard offering framework and the Business Information Model work
    product.<br />
    Targets for each measure should be set with the business.
</p>
<h4>
    Review Total Reward System
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    <i>Note: The design of rewards and remuneration is a specialist HR role. This work product reviews existing reward
    frameworks and identifies opportunities for improvement, but does not redesign the rewards system.</i>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Review the organization's existing rewards frameworks and identify gaps and changes required by the revised
    organization design and measures. Rewards are both formal and informal. Formal rewards include bonuses, pay schemes,
    contribution awards, discounts, holiday days, and company cars, while informal rewards include promotion, time off in
    lieu of pay, invitations to management events, and selection for development.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Identify Reward Objectives</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Identify the objectives of the rewards system and ensure that the results are linked to the to desired behaviors and

    <b>Identify and Evaluate Guiding Principles of the Total Reward System (excluding incentive plans)</b>
