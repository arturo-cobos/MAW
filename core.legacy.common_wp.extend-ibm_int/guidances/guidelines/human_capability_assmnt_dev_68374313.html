<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Note: Most of the tools listed below cover more than one step.</b>
</p><strong>Identify Employees within the In-Scope Part of the Organization Who Will Be Affected by the Initiative</strong>

<p dir="ltr">
    Identify the appropriate people and list their names in a table along with their titles and expected level or type of
    impact from the initiative. The future organization design and job designs will identify the groups that will be
    affected by the redesign -- this is likely to be a subset of those listed on the role map. Also, identify the existing
    organizational roles of vision, hearing, and mobility-impaired personnel in an effort to associate accessibility needs
    accordingly.
</p><strong>Identify Major Capability Requirements</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Three steps lead to the definition of capability requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Set a scale for assessing the level of capability
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Develop a prioritized inventory of capabilities
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Set targets for an optimal level of capability
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Set a Scale for Assessing the Level of Capability</i></b><br />
    The client may have a skill level scale that it would like to be used. Engage the client’s HR department in this
    discussion. IBM’s scale is often used in client engagements:
</p>1. None <br />
2. Concepts only, no hands-on <br />
3. Can do with help <br />
4. Can do without help <br />
5. Can teach others how to do 
<p dir="ltr">
    Longer explanations of this scale are available in IBM’s internal online skills tool (e.g., the Lotus Notes based
    Personal Skills Update (PSU) self-assessment survey tool). Sometimes the scale is set at 0-4 with the same
    definitions.<br />
    <b><i>Develop an Inventory of Capabilities</i></b><br />
    Develop an inventory of the major capabilities that will be required. In the absence of redesign, the client may have
    existing inventories. For IT skills, the Organization Change Knowledge Network’s intellectual capital database contains
    several examples of skill lists. Look under Enablers/MIS Department; ABC and XYZ are two examples that have skill
    lists.<br />
    Developing an inventory is best accomplished in two iterations:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Through a tight process with a small number of people (e.g., one from IBM and one from the client), where the
            client and IBM consultant have sufficient expertise, generate a strawman inventory.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Validate and extend this inventory in facilitated workshops attended by selected performers of the jobs
            affected. This will not only pool expertise but also build common understanding and buy-in among those whose
            capabilities will be assessed.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
    Categorizing skills can help clarify the inventory and make it easier to use. A categorization that is often used is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Job-specific skills -- relate specifically to job tasks (e.g., present annual report to board of directors)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Generic skills -- transferable from job to job (e.g., problem solving, presenting)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Technical skills -- relate to the technology required (e.g., use Lotus 123 to tabulate data)
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    The inventory should be organized by jobs.<br />
    It may be appropriate to include cultural items within the capability evaluation (e.g., organization values). However,
    this will force other changes in the approach that make the assessment process less open and require careful
    management. For example, care should be taken when distributing the results -- these should be distributed only in
    summary form (i.e., no individual ratings) outside of the core team. Using a cultural assessment tool at the
    organization level is usually more appropriate.<br />
    Prioritizing capabilities can be done in the workshops by voting or rating exercises.<br />
    <b><i>Set Targets for Optimal Level of Capability</i></b><br />
    Using the agreed scale, facilitate discussions in the workshops to set the desired level for each capability. Strive
    for balance and practicality -- not all capabilities need to be performed by all employees at the topmost level.
</p><strong>Assess Capabilities</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Next seek input regarding employee capability levels in the appropriate areas of the inventory. This can be done in a
    number of ways, or by using a combination of ways. Bear in mind the client’s culture regarding the sensitivity of
    capability information. Review environmental factors that may require special considerations. For example, the Hong
    Kong police department requires that the urban mobile police force in an inner-city environment must not be burdened
    with cumbersome or heavy equipment. They must have the capability of using lightweight, mobile devices.<br />
    There are several points to make about how to assess capabilities:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        There is a difference between asking questions about the existence of certain practices and capabilities and
        developing a set of metrics that more precisely measures comparative performance.
    </li>
    <li>
        We may want to differentiate between threshold capabilities - those that are essential to be “in the game,”
        capabilities that have the potential to create a competitive advantage, and capabilities that have the potential to
        “change the rules” in a particular sector.
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Structured interview with the people who are being assessed, with managers/supervisors providing validation and
            additional insights
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Structured self-assessment questionnaire completed by the people who are being assessed, with
            managers/supervisors providing validation and additional insights
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Workshops or focus groups with people representing the section(s) of the organization affected. Membership
            should be supplemented with people from the core team and people who interface with the section(s) affected.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    In some client engagements the self-assessment tool has not shown the employee what the target skill level is because
    it might have biased the employee’s rating.
</p><strong>Summarize Data and Analyze Root Cause</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Once the data has been collected, summarize it at both the individual and group level. For the individual level, build
    a capability/people matrix that shows what capabilities are required and whether they exist. Retain the detailed
    information that supports the matrix.<br />
    Summarize the key gaps at the group level. One method is to show in bar charts the percentage of employees who have the
    target level of capability. This is helpful for sizing the need. Another approach is to plot the gaps in quadrants
    according to degree of gap and importance. High-gap, high-importance items take top priority. Low-gap, high-importance
    items offer good news to the client.<br />
    To avoid giving the assumption that training will close every gap, facilitate workshops with employees in which the
    data is presented and root cause is probed. Potential causes of gaps include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Personnel issues
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Facilities or environment
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Tools
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Information
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Accessibility of tools, information, facilities or environment
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Leadership
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Motivation
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Organization structure
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Feedback issues
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Measurement criteria
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    Develop recommendations based on this analysis. Review and validate the conclusions and recommendations with the client
    and project team peers. Ensure that the summary data and root cause analysis are available to consultant and client
    team members involved in change management, organization enabler design, and education and training strategy, plan, and
    specifications.<br />
    Consider holding debriefing sessions to follow up and share results with workshop participants. This is advisable
    because of the relatively larger number of client employees who are likely to be involved in this process. They will
    have an opportunity to give feedback on both the process and the results, and the value they think it will bring.
    Coordinate this event with the transition management and communication plans.<br />
    Typically, we use a combination of questionnaires, interviews, 360 degree feedback, psychometrics (Myers-Briggs,
    insights <a href="http://www.hiresuccess.com/myers-briggs.htm?source-overture"><u>http://www.hiresuccess.com/myers-briggs.htm?source-overture</u></a>)
    to discover where development needs lie.
