    A Transition Management Strategy is a critical first step in developing a successful change capability within the
    organization and numerous subsequent work products. In developing a Transition Management Strategy, consider all the
    potential transition issues that have been highlighted before and during the engagement, understand the transition
    initiatives that have been defined and grouped, and recommend the strategic approaches to the implementation.
</p>
<p>
    1. Develop and validate the case for change<br />
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify and gain approval for an overall transition approach<br />
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop transition management approaches<br />
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rank the elements in a cohesive Transition Management Strategy<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Develop and Validate the Case for Change</strong><br />
    The case for change summarizes what the organization is trying to achieve in the transformation, ranks initiatives
    within that transformation, determines the organizationâ€™s readiness, and defines needed activities.<br />
    You need to understand the implications, both perceived and real, that the planned transition will have on the
    organization to create a strategy that will produce as little disruption as possible. The information will come from a
    variety of inputs, including:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Strategic direction. Be sure to understand the overall business strategy to see if culture change, organization
        redesign, and HR strategies complement it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transition Initiatives. Review the initiatives needed to achieve the transition. You should understand their speed,
        size, impact, and type -- covering the three elements of process, organization, and information technology and all
        sources of change (like IT strategy and initiatives, business initiatives, HR, Finance, and other functional
        changes, and strategic change initiatives).
    </li>
    <li>
        Change Readiness Assessment work product. This work product provides an understanding of the change history of the
        organization, change readiness issues, and where the barriers and enablers to change might lie within the
        organization.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once you have gathered all the information, summarize it in a case for change and brief the members of the client
    executive team, ensuring that they are undertaking the project with full knowledge of what it will take to achieve the
    desired results.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Identify and Gain Approval for the Transition Approach<br />
    </strong> The adopted transition approach will depend on factors such as:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        The urgency of the current situation and the need for the capabilities and benefits from the transition initiatives
    </li>
    <li>
        The degree of risk that the organization is prepared to take
    </li>
    <li>
        The level of financial, material, people, management, and leadership resources that the organization is prepared to
        devote to the implementation
    </li>
    <li>
        Tradeoffs the organization is willing to make to quickly implement the transition initiatives (e.g., willingness to
        delay other initiatives, and willingness or ability to support short-term productivity losses for training and
        learning with overtime and temporary workers)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Construct a set of criteria for the transformation from workshops or interviews with the executive management, focusing
    on topics such as:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        What are the critical initiatives that will give your company the highest value in the next 18-24 months?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are reasonable goals to accomplish with these critical initiatives?
    </li>
    <li>
        From a timing standpoint, which initiatives should be done together or separately? Why?
    </li>
    <li>
        What kind of project discipline should be enforced to ensure we meet our deadlines and budgets?
    </li>
    <li>
        To what degree do you want to engage and energize the work force versus simply inform them of their new
        requirements?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is your expectation for building skills and knowledge in the work force?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are your priorities concerning communication with the work force? Do you have any preferred media? How much
        will you be involved in communications?
    </li>
    <li>
        What kind of would you like to see early on? Where can we deliver quick<br />
        wins?
    </li>
    <li>
        How much of your personal time will you devote to leading or managing specific initiatives? Do you believe this
        will be adequate for convincing the organization that these are critical?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are your priorities in the areas of:&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Temporary productivity losses (due to
    training, learning curve, etc.) and means to recover (e.g., staggered training and implementations,
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temporary workers,
    overtime)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Need for simultaneous move to the new
    requirements across functions and geographies ("efficient" implementation) versus consideration
</div>
<div>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of local requirements and
    need to continue with "regular work" (phased or staggered implementation)
</div>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        How would you like oversight or enforcement of the changes within the work force to take place? (Who will have
        responsibility for ensuring the new actions are taken? What is the tone you would like to set from compliance
        oriented to commitment oriented?)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the criteria have been established and agreed, a small team of senior client staff and consultants should work in
    workshop mode to develop the transition approach. The team will develop various transition scenarios (with their
    associated tradeoffs), based on the transition initiatives, and recommend an approach with several options. The
    scenarios should show how the initiatives are linked to provide a complete viable change in terms of information
    technology, process, and organization.These should be ranked in a recommended implementation approach.
</p>
<p>
    Document and approve the ranked initiatives, transition scenarios, and recommendations in a workshop with the client
    executives. Where financial or resource criteria are critical the recommendations should include high-level assessments
    of the impact on these for each scenario.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Develop Transition Management Approaches<br />
    </strong> The eight critical success factors for a transition are:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Compelling need for change
    </li>
    <li>
        Clarity of direction and vision
    </li>
    <li>
        Visible and committed leadership
    </li>
    <li>
        Targeted, effective, and timely communications
    </li>
    <li>
        Disciplined project management
    </li>
    <li>
        Measurable goals
    </li>
    <li>
        Broad-based participation
    </li>
    <li>
        Single program focus for all change initiatives (Information technology, process, organization)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Keeping those success factors in mind together with the case for change, a core team of management, staff, and
    consultants should work in workshop mode to develop a high-level approach for the six key areas that will ensure a
    successful transformation.<br />
    It is important to identify the full set of options required to have a complete Transition Management Strategy (the
    goals of the transition management) versus the plan (what objectives we will accomplish by when and with what
    resources). Focus on getting client buy-in to the overall goals and their associated tradeoffs before doing detailed
    planning.
</p>
<p>
    Each area outlined below has a discrete work product that addresses it, so one of the decisions that must be made is
    whether or not to fund the work product. Any decision that you make in this step will be a direct input into the work
    product.
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Change Leadership. Who is going to lead and drive the change throughout the organization? How important is this to
        the overall success of the implementation? How will the leaders need to be structured and organized to be most
        effective? What development effort is necessary?
    </li>
    <li>
        Communication. Who are the stakeholders (internal and external) who need to know about the change? What types of
        information will they need? What is the most effective approach to provide the information needed and set the
        desired tone for the implementation? Who will be responsible for communications? How do the organization leaders
        need to participate for greatest effectiveness?
    </li>
    <li>
        Stakeholder Participation. Who will be affected by the change? Given the overall goals and requirements, what is
        the optimum degree of participation from these people and on what topics? What is the overall timetable of their
        participation?
    </li>
    <li>
        Education & Training. What are the knowledge and skill requirements for people to effectively fulfil their
        roles? What approach will best ensure that people will gain this knowledge and skills? How will the current
        education and training capabilities be utilized?
    </li>
    <li>
        Transition Planning. How will all the transition initiatives be coordinated? What is the timing for the transition
        program? How will the initiatives be timed or phased to:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fulfil goals and expectations
            </li>
            <li>
                Achieve best linkage and treatment of dependencies
            </li>
            <li>
                Utilize the resources optimally
            </li>
            <li>
                Optimize the productivity tradeoffs
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Program Management. What are the synergies between initiatives? How can these initiatives be best managed with a
        single program focus?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In developing the approaches, use the data gathered from the executive interviews. Often, you must hold multiple
    meetings and workshops with different teams throughout the organization to create the approaches. Careful and complete
    communication of the tradeoffs is key during this process. Various approaches will be developed in this stage. Create a
    single document with the recommended approaches for the six key areas.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rank the Elements in a Cohesive Transition Management Strategy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    From the data you have gathered and summarized, now develop a Transition Management Strategy that contains:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        The strategic approach to be taken for the transition (e.g., phased or "big bang")
    </li>
    <li>
        A summary of the initiatives in the transition (e.g., IT initiatives, business developments, process redesign,
        etc.), with links and dependencies identified
    </li>
    <li>
        The type, scale, and style of change management interventions needed in the overall transition process (e.g., a
        multi-phased communications program, a refurbished Education & Training program, Change Leadership across all
        divisions, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
        The approaches, guidelines, and principles for each of the six key areas (See example Change Coordination
        Framework)
    </li>
    <li>
        A high-level estimate of resources needed and benefits derived
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once you have developed the Transition Management Strategy, make your final recommendations to the client executive
    team. Modify the strategy as needed.<br />
