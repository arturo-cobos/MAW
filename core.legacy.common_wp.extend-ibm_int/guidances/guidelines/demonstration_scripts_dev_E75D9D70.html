    The Demonstration Script is a team approach process.&nbsp; The Demonstration Script is the primary tool for controlling
    the meetings related to the software selection process.&nbsp; The Selection Team must therefore be in concurrence
    regarding the Demonstration Script contents and agenda priorities.&nbsp; There are components within the script that
    will be assigned to individuals, but the agenda definition and final edit will clearly require a team effort.
</p>
<p>
    The first step in the Demonstration Script development is the demonstration meeting agenda definition.&nbsp; This
    agenda setting is a Selection Team effort.&nbsp; The duration of each vendor demonstration must first be verified
    (e.g., 2 or 3 days) since the number and length of demonstrations is usually defined in the Statement of Work
    agreement.&nbsp; The Team is next presented with sample agendas to facilitate their understanding.&nbsp; The company's
    priorities are next used to establish an initial presentation sequence, for example, it could follow a <em>Supply
    Chain</em> flow for a manufacturing client.&nbsp; The functional topics are sequenced into the agenda as the Team may
    wish to see the vendor presentation.
</p>
<p>
    After a general agenda sequence is determined, the time allotments are established for each topic.&nbsp; It is better
    to identify all of the topics and the sequence so the Team sees how much must be covered.&nbsp; Do not forget to insert
    adequate time for breaks and lunch into the schedule.&nbsp; The discussion will then involve the tradeoffs in how much
    time will be allotted to any individual topic.&nbsp; The Team may be requested to lengthen the day's start and stop
    time, or they may ask for a longer duration (from 2 days to 3 days).&nbsp; The Team may also choose to schedule
    “break-out sessions” where a portion of the Team watches a demonstration topic in parallel with another part (e.g.,
    Financials may be demonstrated at the same time as Production.).&nbsp; The consequences of these requests need to be
    reviewed.&nbsp; Ultimately, the Team will need to set time allotments for each functional area.&nbsp; The Project
    Leader will need to reiterate that the demonstration process may not be able to cover every requirement, and the
    emphasis will be placed on time allocation and prioritization.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    It is very important to <u>not overload the agenda</u>.&nbsp; If the demonstration topics exceed the allocated time,
    the vendors will selectively present the topics that they are best qualified to handle.&nbsp; The demonstration
    coverage will be inconsistent, and the Selection Team will need to select a vendor based on inconsistent input.&nbsp;
    This will result in additional uncertainty and anxiety during the decision process.&nbsp; The demonstration meeting
    time allotment is a critical factor.
</p>
<p>
    After the demonstration agenda is defined, individual team members will be requested to develop script scenarios for
    functional topics in the agenda.&nbsp; The individuals may use the results from defining the Business Processes and
    Request for Information (or Request for Solution) as input into the detailed topic development.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The detailed items in a scenario should be worded with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        “Demonstrate” or “show” as the verbs to indicate actually wanting to see how the software will handle the
        requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
        “Describe” or “discuss” are used to indicate when a verbal presentation may be used to cover a point.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Showing a requirement may require too much time in many instances, or some background processing considerations (e.g.,
    EDI, MRP Regen, etc.) do not lend to being shown, other than possibly the end result.&nbsp; The selection of the
    appropriate verb is important to demonstration time management on a topic.
</p>
<p>
    Demonstration scenario detail topics should avoid being multi-part questions.&nbsp; Since a score will be assigned to
    each scenario item, the scenario should create questions or items for each topic to be covered.&nbsp; Items under a
    demonstration scenario should be concise, and the item should use commonly used terminology to minimize clarification
    of questions during the demonstration.
</p>
<p>
    After the individuals submit their scenarios, an IBM and client team leader will verify scenarios against time
    allotments.&nbsp; The wording and format will also be standardized among the individual scenarios.&nbsp; Team leaders
    may need to actually generate scenario items on subject where the client does not have familiarity with future
    functional requirements (e.g., product configuration, Activity Based Costing, etc.).&nbsp; The edited scenarios will
    need to be reviewed with the Selection Team to assure that the members remain in agreement with the Demonstration
    Script's content.&nbsp; If major scenario revisions are performed, the individual, who handled the topic, should be
    contacted directly for personal review.
</p>
<p>
    After the Demonstration Script sections are consolidated, the client and IBM Team Leaders should perform a detailed
    edit.&nbsp; After these leaders have finished their Script edit, the Selection Team members should be given a few days
    to review this document.&nbsp; A final team meeting should be held to review the document with the Team prior to
    delivery to the selected vendors.&nbsp; This Demonstration Script Review meeting will discuss the script and the
    demonstration agenda to assure that the users are in agreement with the demonstration process.
</p>
<p>
    Company background for the Demonstration Script can usually be obtained from annual report or from marketing
    information.&nbsp; The administrative assistant to senior management will generally have the desired information in an
    electronic format for insertion into the Script.&nbsp; The IT Manager will also be asked to provide information on the
    client's current system.
</p>
<p>
    A glossary of client terms should also be generated with simple descriptions.&nbsp; The client will have company or
    industry specific terms that the IBM team members should note during prior activities.&nbsp; A list of these terms and
    acronym's should be provided to the client's Team Leader for definition.
</p>
<p>
    The Demonstration Script may be generated from a standard template, which contains the Confidentially Statement and
    Request for References sections.&nbsp; The remaining sections will be generated based on inserting the appropriate
    information into the template.<br />
