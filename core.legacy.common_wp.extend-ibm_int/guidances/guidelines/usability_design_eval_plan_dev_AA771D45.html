    <b>Steps to follow to develop the Usability Design and Evaluation Plan:</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>1.</b> <b>Gather and review existing critical business, usability, accessibility, and system requirements and work
    products.</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    This review is completed with attention to any end user, training, job/task performance, or technical environment
    criteria or requirements identified in other project work products that can contribute to defining the appropriate
    usability design and evaluation strategies. If there are critical gaps in the information needed, the project team will
    need to fill the gaps in order to complete Step 2.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>2.</b> <b>Assess the client’s solution usability criteria and quantify in terms of an agreed upon problem fix rate
    model.</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    Use the criteria identified in Step 1 and subsequent discussions with the solution owners to arrive at a problem fix
    rate model for the solution. If usability is a key issue for the solution (for example, as is the case with public web
    applications or solutions sold to the US Federal government htat must meet Section 508 Accessibility Standards), the
    solution team will want to select a Model 1, “market leader” fix rate, for example.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>3.</b> <b>Tailor the user-centered design process to be used for the project.</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    Based on Steps 1 and 2, review the methodology, tasks, and work product descriptions, and determine which of the
    usability engineering work products are applicable to the engagement. This should be done by reviewing the “Reasons for
    Not Wanting This Work Product<i>”</i> and “Impact of Not Having This Work Product” sections of each of the usability
    engineering work products and determining the level of the overall user-centered design approach.<br />
</p>
<p>
    There is not a cookbook approach for deciding which work products to include or exclude from the effort. It is advised
    that this activity be conducted by someone highly familiar and experienced in the user-centered design approach and in
    the design and development of user interface work products. It is also recommended that someone skilled in
    accessibility participate in deciding which work products to include.<br />
</p>
<p>
    As a high-level general rule of thumb, however, it can be inferred that if the fix rate model is “market leader”, the
    user-centered design team will likely need to develop all or most of the work products to support the solution
    adequately from an ease of use standpoint. If the fix rate model is “meets competition” or “status quo”, the selected
    work products will likely be in the core deliverables for the solution:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            A document containing usability requirements
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A document containing accessibility requirements that map to applicable accessibility standards, such as
            defined by Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            This Usability Design and Evaluation Plan
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A user interface prototype
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A user interface design specification
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    <b>4.</b> <b>Determine the skills, resources, and team members needed for the project.</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    After tailoring the user-centered design process and deciding on which work products will be delivered, determine the
    skills, resource, and support needs for completing these selected tasks and work products. This can be done by
    reviewing the estimating guidelines of each of the work products identified for delivery for the engagement.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>5.</b> <b>Determine the activities and schedule.</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    Once the user-centered design work products have been agreed upon, review the development approach section of each of
    the associated work product descriptions, and add these steps to the schedule. The estimating guidelines for each of
    the work product descriptions can give general rules of thumb for scheduling the activities.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>6.</b> <b>Identify assumptions and dependencies.</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    Identify dependencies that will impact the user-centered design team’s ability to meet their time, schedule, and
    deliverables schedule.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>7.</b> <b>Specify change control process.</b><br />
</p>
<p>
    Set up and communicate the change management process to all affected parties. The change management process needs to be
    proposed and approved before any application construction occurs.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <b>8.</b> <b>Document all of the above and include in a design notebook.</b> Use the web site <a href="http://w3.software.ibm.com/ucd/html/ucdtemplate.html"><u>http://w3.software.ibm.com/ucd/html/ucdtemplate.html</u></a>
    as a starting point for setting up a database. Ensure the information itself meets accessibility guidelines, especially
    for any current or future members of the extended team who may have disabilities or use assistive technologies (See
    references for accessible Documentation checklist).
