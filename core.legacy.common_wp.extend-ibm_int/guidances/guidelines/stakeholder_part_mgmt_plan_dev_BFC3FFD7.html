<P><STRONG>Review Business Case, Goals, Strategy/Vision from Initial Analysis and Stakeholder Groups</STRONG> </P>
<P dir=ltr>This work product should be prepared with a full understanding of the organization’s business strategy and goals that will affect the type of engagement approach, its definition, and how stakeholders and stakeholder groups will be affected. For example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>If the client’s strategy is to move toward consistent, global deployment of processes, the approach to the engagement should be collaborative. It is likely that a significant number of client communities will need to be included, supported by communications tailored to a wide number of client groups.</DIV></LI></UL>
<P dir=ltr>Or,</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>The existing culture of the organization will influence the style of participation unless a major culture change is accompanying the implementation. Some organizations are hierarchical and autocratic; some may be more autonomous and flexible. The existing style will dictate the level and type of involvement and communication.</DIV></LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Define Principles of Engagement and Participation</STRONG> </P>
<P dir=ltr>Engagement principles are a means of ensuring consistency and effectiveness in the process of involving and communicating with stakeholder groups and individuals. The complete process of engagement can be lengthy and involve numbers of different groups depending on the size and complexity of the project, and these principles can provide valuable direction. This activity contains the principles of engagement at a high level. <BR>The senior sponsor(s) must realize the extent of involvement required from relevant staff at all levels to ensure a smooth transition and, in particular, the creation of a full time <B>project team</B>. The approximate requirements, including time commitments and number of people for the project team need to be agreed upon up front. When drafting the principles of engagement you might consider using:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>An overall approach and strategy to managing participation</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>An agreement with the client to the extent of involvement required from relevant staff at all levels, including the approximate requirement for full-time staff members </DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>An agreement on the types of roles client staff will perform in principle</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>An understanding that the availability of client staff will vary depending on the phase of the project and the demand of the business</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>A high-level strategy on how to involve external stakeholder groups that might be affected by the change (such as customers, suppliers, or unions)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>An approach on how to handle groups and individuals who may join or leave the company during the course of the engagement</DIV></LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Segment Client Groups into Key Stakeholder Groups or Individuals, and Prioritize</STRONG> </P>
<P dir=ltr>Segmentation can be used to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Identify key stakeholder groups or individuals within the organization whose assistance and active involvement will benefit the change initiative</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Match the content and targeting of a change initiative to the needs and behaviors of key stakeholder groups and individuals</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Define logical groupings within the organization to achieve the most cost-effective introduction approach</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Focus the Project Office’s attention on real, identifiable individuals and groups to encourage a more personalized approach to the engagement</DIV></LI></UL>
<P dir=ltr>Several tools can help the segmentation process:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Role Mapping tool</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Organization Network Analysis, which will provide information on how groups within the organization communicate and interact</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Stakeholder table</DIV></LI></UL>
<P dir=ltr>It is possible to segment along a variety of different criteria, such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Geographic location (country, region, town, work location)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Organization basis (job role, functional area)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Demographic basis (nationality)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Behavioral basis (state of readiness, attitude to the initiative)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Needs or benefits basis (benefits sought, feature needs, information needs)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Change roles (initiating sponsor, sustaining sponsor, change agent)</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Internal/external</DIV></LI></UL>
<P dir=ltr>Be careful of over-segmentation. Segmenting into too many groups can complicate the engagement process with relatively little enhanced value. Segmentation is concerned with identifying and selecting members of the client organization who are targets for the initiative, in such a way as to group those who can be engaged in the same manner. Whenever possible, look for a common approach in addressing groups who have similar needs and characteristics. <BR>Remember that segmentation is an iterative process. This step should be done throughout the change project to realign key stakeholder and groups.</P><STRONG>Analyze Stakeholder Issues and Roles</STRONG> 
<P dir=ltr>In 5.3 above, you loosely segmented the client organization into different groups using a high-level approach. In this step, you are digging deeper into understanding how the groups and individuals behave and react toward change. Also, you need to discover who has the greatest influence on the project and who will be highly involved. It may be necessary to re-segment your stakeholder groups as a result of your findings. </P>1. Classify stakeholders according to their reactions to change <BR>2. Classify key stakeholders according to their level of involvement <BR>3. Plot stakeholder analysis <BR>4. Define stakeholder objectives 
<P dir=ltr><B>Classify Stakeholders According to their Reactions to Change </B></P>
<P dir=ltr>Before an analysis can be conducted of the key stakeholder groups or individuals whom you have segmented in step 5.3, it is necessary to establish the kinds of reactions/responses that will be encountered during the process of change. Change will elicit the following human responses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Passive resistance</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Active resistance</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Indifference</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Acceptance</DIV></LI></UL>
<P dir=ltr>Each of these responses can be mapped onto the following Willingness and Ability axis. The titles are followed by possible mechanisms to cope with their behaviors, i.e., someone who has a high willingness to change, but doesn’t possess the skills to do so would be categorized as "Follower - Can’t & Will"” <BR>Use the following table to help classify individuals and groups by identifying some of the characteristics specific to each.</P><IMG style="WIDTH: 754px; HEIGHT: 395px" height=395 alt="Table to Classify Individuals and Groups" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/StakeholderParticipationManagementPlan1.JPG" width=600>

This process will help clarify stakeholder groups feelings about and behaviors toward change. It will help identify like-minded individuals who can be conveniently grouped as a stakeholder audience. <BR><B>Classify Key Stakeholders According to their Level of Involvement</B> <BR>As indicated in the Stakeholder Table, all stakeholders have different levels of involvement and influence on the change program. You should now confirm and refine these levels according to the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV><B>Level of involvement</B> - what kind of impact the change is going to have on stakeholders. Develop the measures on how to classify the level of involvement, for example: </DIV>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Stakeholder’s whole job and department changes due to the change initiative (High). </DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>There will be some shuffling of job responsibilities for the stakeholder (Medium). </DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>The stakeholder will not be affected at all by the change (Low).</DIV></LI></UL>
<LI>
<DIV><B>Level of influence</B> - what kind of impact the stakeholder will have on the change initiative. Develop the measures on how to classify the level of influence, for example:</DIV>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>Stakeholder can block or enable the the change initiative (High).</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Stakeholder can make the change more difficult or easier (Medium).</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV>Stakeholder will have little to no impact on the change initiative (Low)</DIV></LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P dir=ltr>Both the reactions to change and the levels of involvement and influence can be best captured in the Stakeholder Table: </P>

<P dir=ltr><B>Plot Stakeholder Analysis</B> <BR>The information from the Stakeholder Table needs to be plotted against the Stakeholder Analysis Template below.

<P dir=ltr><B>Define Stakeholder Objectives</B> <BR>For each of the key stakeholders in the change process, you now need to assess what level of support and attention is required for the change to have the greatest chances of success. From the Stakeholder Analysis - Analysis Template, you can determine who the key players are, whether each is an Opponent, Follower, or Enthusiast and in what direction their attitude ideally needs to move or change, if at all. This helps to prioritize actions and shows where a greater or lesser degree of effort is required. <BR>A matrix like the following example may be useful to see where to focus your attention:</P>

<P dir=ltr><B>Review Implementation Plan to Identify Key Milestones</B> <BR>You must understand how the project is going to roll out so that you can understand how each stakeholder will be affected at each stage of the project implementation. This will act to guide the levels of information and involvement activities for each stage. As a rule, you should provide information and involvement activities before any major phase of the implementation begins, as it will prepare people for the change and lessen the chances of resistance. <BR><B>Determine Stakeholder Needs and Issues at each Phase</B> <BR>Each stakeholder group and individual may experience different reactions to each phase of the change initiative. What may seem very threatening to one group may not even register to another stakeholder group. One group may need to be very involved in a phase, whereas another group need only hear an update.
