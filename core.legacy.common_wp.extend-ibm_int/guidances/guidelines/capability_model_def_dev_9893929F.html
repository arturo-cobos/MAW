    A fully elaborated Capability Model Definition will include a complete set of capabilities and their associated
    enablers. It will show the linkages between capabilities, likewise enablers.
</p>
<p>
    At the business design level, it will include a quantification of both the degree of relationship, positive and
    negative, between capabilities, and the degree of support networked capabilities provide to the value proposition of
    the business design.
</p>
<p>
    At the actionable project level, it will show cross initiative capability dependencies, and prioritize capabilities and
    enablers for the purposes of investment and resource allocation as well as release planning.
</p>
<p>
    The work product will be developed in a number of unique and iterative steps. These steps are not necessarily
    sequential but will include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identification of complete set of capabilities to fulfill the value propositions of the value exchanges in the
        business design or focal area of the engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Classification of capabilities as External, Supporting and Core (enterprise level, reusable, common).
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of complete set of enablers (process, knowledge/information, organization and technology) required
        by the capability set in the business design or focal area of the engagement.<br />
        Steps 1, 2 and 3 ensure that the prioritization and allocation of investment and other resources consider the
        complete requirement set.
    </li>
    <li>
        Analysis of gaps in capabilities ( and, at later phases, enablers) will use two types of comparison:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                the existing set of capabilities in the firm
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: none">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Compare the existing capabilities with those identified to support the strategic opportinities and
                        resulting initiatives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select those which are still required
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Indentify those which require enhancement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Indentify those which are obsolete
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                industry of functional norms and leading practices
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: none">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Compare the set of capabilities identified to support the strategic opportunities and resulting
                        initiatives with those exhibited by the industry, or key competitiors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assess the impact of not providing missing capabilities on the value propsotions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assess the impact of providing additional capabilities on the performance of the business design
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Relationships between capabilities<br />
        A key objective of the Capability Model Definition work product is to produce a network of capabilities and
        associated enablers which demonstrate consistency and reinforcement between one another and value propositions they
        impact to value net players and the business itself.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        The properties of capability relationships are described in terms of:
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        <b>Direction</b>: representing the causality of the relationship. This is critical in order to understand and
        anticipate the impact of changing a capability, on all other the other capabilities with which it has a dependency
        relationship.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        <b>Strength</b>: the degree and condition of support capabilities. The condition of support can be positive and
        enabling, or enforcing. However, it can also be negative and disabling, or suppressing, which prevents the firm
        from getting full value from its investment in capabilities.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        At a high level, the degree of positive or negative support can be indicated by a designation of high, medium or
        low. More detailed analysis may require a ranking of 1-5, or 1-10.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identification of capabilities/enablers which can be reused to serve more than one value exchange, opportunity and
        initiative. (Also, identification of capabilities/enablers that overlap.)<br />
        Where Capabilities are reusable or overlapping, they should be combined and consolidated to avoid inefficient use
        of investment and enablers. This step ensures investment decisions are fully leveraged across the Business Design,
        and may result in more funds being made available for more flexible/robust enabler solutions.<br />
        A good example of a reusable capability is workflow. Workflow provides the ability to handle the business events
        and interactions between value net players automatically, based on mutually agreed business rules. If the
        capability were specified for a supplier value exchange alone, a procurement specific workflow engine might be
        suggested. If other customer, business partner or distribution channel value exchanges could also benefit from this
        capability, a more generally configurable work flow engine must be selected.<br />
        Where reuse, or overlap includes existing capabilities, the capability should be renamed to avoid preconceived
        ideas about the boundaries of the capability.
    </li>
    <li>
        The prioritization of capabilities/enablers with strategic opportunities and initiatives, helps to facilitate
        investment decisions, resource allocation and and release planning.
    </li>
    <li>
        identification of Cross Initiative capability/enabler dependencies, supports informed decision making. For example,
        a capability may be a lower priority for one initiative, than another which shares it. This cross initiative
        dependency mapping is a critical part of investment and release planning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Leveraging synergies between capabilities adds value to the overall business model. New business capabilities can
        emerge from innovative combinations of capabilities. In one strategy engagement, a new business opportunity arose
        from leveraging the global logistocs capabilty of strategic suppliers who could supply parts of the globe, beyond
        the normal reach of the client. This yielded increased revenue not only for the client, but also for the suppliers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifying opportunties to share capabilities and enablers across business units.<br />
