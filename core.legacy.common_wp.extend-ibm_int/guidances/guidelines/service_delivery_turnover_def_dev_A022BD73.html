    Service delivery turnover requires a high level of collaboration between the development/maintenance Team and SD team.
    This collaboration is aided by the compilation and understanding of a detailed Service Delivery Turnover Definition
    that includes all documentation deemed important and required for successful transition by the SD team. This
    information is typically set forth in the IT standards. It is the charter and responsibility of the SD team to ensure
    that it receives adequate assets to provide service delivery functions effectively and properly.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The SD team will start with the completed business and functional requirements as input to its determination of the
        assets required for successful turnover and transition. The SD team should require access to the completed
        requirements (e.g., Business process model, Non-functional requirements) in order to familiarize it with the
        specified application functions and capabilities and to ensure that the expected level of system delivery and
        operation are maintained.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the completed requirements as a base, the SD team will determine the new and updated assets such as system
        documents, tools, procedures and environments, defect logs, issue logs, change request logs, test assets, response
        times required to deliver the expected levels of system delivery.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The SD team will assess the need for additional resources depending on the type of turnover. Service Delivery may
        involve additional or different skills and/or resources. In such cases, the SD team must plan for acquiring these
        skills and/or resources needed for service delivery functions.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The SD team will confirm the list of required assets (e.g., documents such as setup procedures and environments)
        with the development/maintenance teams and will define the acceptance criteria for each of the identified assets
        and perform a quick check of the quality of the artifacts. These should include content, presentation, access and
        any other pertinent conditions. The acceptance criteria will be linked to whatever technology standards are in
        effect for the respective application.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The SD team will define a corresponding compliance and verification approach for each asset and its associated
        acceptance criteria, depending upon the turnover scope and or other circumstances and appropriateness.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The SD team will ensure the integrity of the turnover through the execution of the compliance and verification
        approaches in maintaining the highest levels of production quality. The SD team will further develop agreed-upon
        change management approaches governing the configuration of the required assets as the physical turnover is
        executed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The validation criteria focus on the existence, completeness and consistency of the checklist(s) which:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Enumerate the expected components (software, hardware and other) to be included with any application to be
        transitioned to the production environment or Service to be initiated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Establish criteria for evaluating the quality and suitability of those components.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Documentation of the system(s) to be turned over include, for example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Requirements (e.g., batch flow, non-functional requirements).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Asset documents (e.g., design, change logs).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        &nbsp;Tools, procedures and environment descriptions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The specific items in the checklist(s) depend on the documentation appropriate to or expected of the SD team.
</p>
<p>
    The verification approach on how each asset will be verified should be based on the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        System performance specifications will be traced back to the non-functional requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Supporting documentation for each asset is to be passed to the SD team via the project manager.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review with the development team supplying the assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
            The SD team will review and raise any issues or concerns regarding documentation logging all information in the
            issue log via the project manager
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
            The SD team to ensure that it is fit for the intended purpose will verify each asset.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspection and sampling specific to each of the assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        The SD team will acknowledge acceptance of the asset by signing an acceptance from which will be logged and stored
        on the project server.
    </li>
    <li>
        A spread sheet will be maintained showing the position of each asset in the acceptance process.
    </li>
    <li>
        The application will be deemed to be accepted once all the acceptance criteria have been met, service levels have
        been agreed and there are no contract or support issues outstanding.
    </li>
