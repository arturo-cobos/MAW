<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The steps involving the transformation of the information in a functional model to a Program Module Invocation Model are
inherently iterative. They are structured design. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify the major transaction processing modules. These modules will be placed near the top of the call
            structure. Transaction Analysis is a design strategy by which the structure of a system is derived from a study
            of the transactions that the system must process. At the highest levels of the functional model, the major
            processes often relate to major system interactions with external actors. Make each of the major
            transaction-oriented processes a module invoked near the root of the call hierarchy. These modules allow the
            system to be partitioned into more tractable units of design. The design effort can then be pursued by separate
            teams, each working within its partition of the system.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify the data processing modules. Transform Analysis is a design strategy in which the structure of the
            system is derived from the flow of data through a system and the transformations that occur to that data. The
            data flow diagrams (DFDs) under the main transaction-oriented processes provide the main vehicle for factoring
            the remaining system.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        - Starting at the top of the DFD hierarchy, identify the central transform for each diagram. The central transform
        represents the most basic or essential piece of work performed by the processes of that DFD. The central
        transform’s action may be comprised of one or more processes near the center of the data flow in the DFD.
        Frequently on DFDs, processes acting as sources or links for off-page data flows play a data formatting role. When
        these are conceptually removed, what remains is an indication of the central transform’s action. The central
        transform is promoted to be the highest, or controlling, module in this piece of the call hierarchy.<br />
        - Once the controlling module is identified, it is named to describe the action of the entire set of modules below
        it. Its data interface must be designed to support the transient data needs of its subordinate modules. The
        subordinate modules are identified using the processes of the DFD as a starting point. Detailed processing is
        removed from the controlling module and placed in the subordinate ones, moving invocation logic towards the root,
        and algorithmic implementation towards the leaves of the call tree. The subordinate modules are descriptively
        named, and their interfaces are made to support the transient data needs of their subordinates.

        <div>
            Study the entire module structure for characteristics of good design.

</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        - Where redundancy occurs, either in one module or among several, factor it out into its own module.<br />
        - Study the fan-out (the number of immediate subordinates a module has) of the modules in the hierarchy. Try to
        limit this number to no more than seven. Modules with excessive fan-out should be factored.<br />
        - Study the fan-in (the number of modules that invoke a particular module) of the modules in a hierarchy. A high
        fan-in number often indicates a high level or reuse; however, make sure that such modules are cohesive and their
        interfaces are identical across invocations.<br />
        - Assess the cohesion of each module. The components of a module are associated with each other by virtue of their
        co-location in the module. In a well-designed module, this co-location is based on some functional association,
        i.e., the module is cohesive. Some examples of justifiable component association include combination to perform a
        particular task, combination because the invocation sequence is common, and combination because all the components
        share a data interface. Modules with low cohesion should be factored.<br />
        - Assess the coupling between modules. Coupling is the degree of dependence one module has on another. Higher
        coupling increases the ripple effect of errors and changes in a system. Minimal, obvious, appropriately structured
        data interfaces between modules minimize coupling. Global data and program execution jumps to share code increase
        coupling to inappropriate levels.
