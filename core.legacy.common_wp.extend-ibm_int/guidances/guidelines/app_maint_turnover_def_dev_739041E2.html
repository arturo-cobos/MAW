    Application turnover requires a high level of collaboration between the AD and AME teams. This collaboration is aided
    by the compilation and understanding of a detailed customer deliverable that includes all assets and documentation
    deemed important and required for successful transition by the AME team. This information is typically set forth in the
    IT Standards. It is the charter and responsibility of the AME team to ensure that it receives adequate assets to
    provide maintenance/enhancement functions effectively and properly.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The AME team will start with the completed business and functional requirements as input to its determination of
        the assets required for successful turnover and transition. The AME team should require access to the completed
        requirements (e.g., Business Process Model, Use Case Model, Non-Functional Requirements) in order to familiarize it
        with the specified application functions and capabilities and to ensure that the expected level of system delivery
        and operation are maintained.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the completed requirements as a base, the AME teams will determine the new and updated assets such as
        application system documents (e.g., design, program module specifications), procedures and environments, defect
        logs, issue logs, change request logs, test assets required to deliver the expected levels of system delivery and
        maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
        The AME team will assess the need for additional resources depending on the type of turnover.&nbsp; Maintenance of
        applications may involve additional or different skills and/or resources. In such cases, the AME team must plan for
        acquiring these skills and/or resources needed for application maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
        The AME team will confirm the list of required assets (e.g., documents such as System Context, UI Design
        Specification, and Component Model, custom tools, setup procedures and application environments) with the
        development teams and will define the acceptance criteria for each of the identified assets. Perform a quick check
        of the quality of the artifacts. These should include content, presentation, access and any other pertinent
        conditions. The acceptance criteria will be linked to whatever technology standards are in effect for the
        respective application.
    </li>
    <li>
        The AME team should document any informal understanding of customer satisfaction issues that should be transferred,
        if needed, from the AD team. Service Level Agreements (SLA’s) constitute an important part of the satisfaction
        criteria and must be addressed between IBM AME team and the customer. The SLA’s that need consideration are:
        Application Availability, Problem Responsiveness, Batch Window Availability, Escalation, Estimation Turnaround,
        Problem Resolution and Software Availability.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the turnover includes the warranty period of application development, a log will be maintained by the IBM AME
        team to record defects, analyze their source, establish responsibilities for closure and take appropriate
        corrective action. This effort involves a cost that needs to be factored in the estimates.
    </li>
    <li>
        The AME team will define a corresponding compliance and verification approach for each asset and its associated
        acceptance criteria, depending upon the turnover scope and or other circumstances and
        appropriateness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The AME team will ensure the integrity of the turnover through the execution of the compliance and verification
        approaches in maintaining the highest levels of production quality. The AME team will further develop agreed-upon
        change management approaches governing the configuration of the required assets as the physical turnover is
        executed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    During the turnover lifecycle, it is important that the AD Project Manager and the AME Project Manager be on the same
    wavelength. In this context:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The AD Project Manager has responsibility for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Providing</em> the AME Project Manager with the application background.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Involving</em> the AME Project Manager or appointed deputy in the turnover kick-off meeting.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Consolidating</em> project assets in consultation with AME Project Manager.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The AME Project Manager has responsibility for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Defining the application turnover scope.
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating an asset checklist and a turnover assessment checklist for the turnover and supplying it to the AD Project
        Manager.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conducting review meetings with the AD Project Manager during the application turnover lifecycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifying the relevant AME team/personnel that will support the application.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The validation and verification as discussed below is only intended to serve as a checkpoint for a smooth takeover by
    the AME team.&nbsp; The turnover process in general is subject to compliance as determined by the QA processes of the
    AME team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    The validation criteria should focus on the existence, completeness and consistency of the checklist(s) which:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Enumerate the expected components to be included with any application to be transitioned to the maintenance and
        production environment.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Establish criteria for evaluating the quality and suitability of those components.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The specific items in the checklist(s) depend on the documentation appropriate to or expected of the AME team.
</p>
<p>
    The verification approach on how each asset will be verified should be based on the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All requirements, design, program module specifications and test results will be traced back to the business and
        functional requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Supporting documentation for each asset is to be passed to the AME team via the project manager.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review with the development team supplying the assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        The AME team will review and raise any issues or concerns regarding documentation logging all information in the
        issue log via the project manager.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each asset will be verified by the AME team to ensure that it is fit for purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspection and sampling specific to each of the assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        The AME team will acknowledge acceptance of the asset by signing an acceptance form which will be logged and stored
        in the Project Control Book.
    </li>
    <li>
        The asset checklist will show the position of each asset in the acceptance process.
    </li>
    <li>
        The application will be deemed to be accepted once all the acceptance criteria have been met and there are no
        contract or support issues outstanding.
    </li>
