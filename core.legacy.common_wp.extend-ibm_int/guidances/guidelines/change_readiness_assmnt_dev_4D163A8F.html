<p>
    <strong>1.</strong> <strong>Review and Assess Business Case, Goals, Strategy, and Vision for Capacity to Provide
    Motivation and Direction for the Initiative</strong><br />
    Examine the business case, goals, strategy, and vision for the organization to identify their strengths and weaknesses
    in supporting change. These organizational statements should have the capacity to motivate employees to support the
    initiative. They should lay out the direction for change clearly and comprehensively. All of these statements should be
    in alignment.<br />
    Consultants who have completed the course "Fundamentals of Change Management" are licensed to use an ODR, Inc. tool,
    Change Project Description Form, which is a useful format for exploring the above topics. This form can be done
    individually or completed in the context of a facilitated discussion, preferably with client participation. Document
    any shortcomings discovered.<br />

</p>
<p>
    <b>2. Identify Stakeholders and Participants and Create Role Map</b><br />
    Consultants who have completed the course "Fundamentals of Change Management" are licensed to use an ODR tool, Role
    Map, which is a useful format for cataloguing all those who have a role in the transition. It categorizes those
    involved as sponsors, advocates, change agents, and targets. It traces the relationships among participants according
    to their influence upon each other and their roles in assisting each other. Key stakeholders and potential survey
    participants or groups can be identified using this tool. This tool is especially useful in the planning stages of a
    project but can be used repeatedly to trace progress in filling all key roles and ensuring there are no gaps in the
    cascade of sponsorship. Both a graphic and list version are usually produced.<br />
    This is a good opportunity to identify groups that would be asked to participate in large-scale surveys. If such
    surveys are likely to be done, ensure that you identify a representative population large enough to produce credible
    data in this step.<br />
    This activity requires that the consultant(s) work closely with the client core team members.<br />

    <strong>3. Engage Key Stakeholders and Client Project Management to Prepare Them for Assessment Process</strong><br />
    This activity introduces sponsors, process owners, client project management, and steering committees to the basics of
    change management and establishes the foundation for accepting the assessment. It also sets out a framework for
    developing their capability as change leaders. An interactive workshop is the most effective setting in which to
    accomplish these goals. A typical agenda for a change management workshop would include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An introduction to the basic concepts of organization change (i.e., emotional responses to change, the reasons for
        managing change)
    </li>
    <li>
        Discussion of the role that the vision will play in motivating change, and confirmation that stakeholders are
        aligned in their view of the vision&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Information about how the assessment will be conducted and reported
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Expected outcomes of the workshop would be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Establishment of a common vocabulary for change management
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved executive preparedness to handle emotional responses to change&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        A single shared vision of the project and its goals&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of potential change leaders&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Establishment of a consistent base of knowledge about the readiness assessment activities&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Following the workshop, document any issues uncovered in the workshop regarding the participants’ readiness to play an
    active role in managing change. Capture the names of people who are candidates to play a leadership role in managing
    the transition. Note any factors that would affect the selection of assessment tools.<br />
    If this workshop does not take place there is a danger that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Executives will not share a single project vision.
    </li>
    <li>
        No techniques will be established for managing the emotional response to change.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The consulting change management team will be expected to eliminate resistance with little or no help from the
        client.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <b>4. Select Assessment Tools</b><br />
    Consultants who have completed the course "Fundamentals of Change Management" are licensed to use a suite of ODR tools
    to assess change readiness. The tools are classified as either interactive or diagnostic.<br />
    Interactive tools are used in a focus group to generate group dialogue to explore issues. The questions are stimulating
    and provocative ("loaded"). They can be self-scored by participants on the spot. The interactive tools are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Change Response Scale
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementation History Assessment&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Predicting the Impact of Change&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Another ODR tool, the Commitment Matrix, can be completed with the help of the client team. It is used to format
    information about commitments in concurrent projects that could pose potential conflicts or compete for limited
    resources.<br />
    Organization network analysis can be used to map the flow of informal communications. This tool is quite robust and can
    have a very high impact. It requires a 100% return of surveys to generate usable data. The recommended maximum size of
    any single group to be mapped is about 70 -- beyond that the maps are very difficult to read. Access to this tool
    requires completion of a distance learning course on its usage.<br />
    A 60 question survey tool, Denison's "Organizational Culture Survey", is designed to assess four organization culture
    traits which Dr. Denison's research has shown to have a significant impact on organization performance. These traits
    are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mission - defining a long-term direction for the organization
    </li>
    <li>
        Adaptability - translating the demands of the business environment into action
    </li>
    <li>
        Consistency - defining the values and systems that are the basis of a strong culture
    </li>
    <li>
        Involvement - building human capability, ownership, and responsibility&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each trait has three measurable sub-elements.<br />
    Completed surveys are sent to Denison for processing. The resulting report compares a client's culture to higher and
    lower performing organizations and includes prescriptive suggestions. The survey is available in either paper or
    electronic form. No specific training or certification is required for use. More information can be found on the
    company's website at <a href="http://www.denisonculture.com/"><u>www.denisonculture.com</u></a>.<br />
    This work product includes an initial stakeholder analysis that defines the degree of support needed from key
    stakeholders and identifies existing gaps. BTCM-08, "Stakeholder/Participation Management Plan," carries out this
    analysis in greater detail. Stakeholder analysis tools are available in Organization Change on ICM AssetWeb; data is
    typically gathered in interviews, workshops, and focus groups rather than in surveys.<br />
    A tool for assessing change leadership is based on IBM’s own internal model for change leadership.<br />
    Other tools have been developed for particular engagements and can be found in Organization Change on ICM AssetWeb
    (e.g., organization readiness assessment fast-path methodology). While the approaches and instruments may vary, the
    concepts of change management and the factors assessed are similar in all of them.<br />
    Key considerations for tool selection are the time available and size of the sample. When constrained by time or
    resource, guard against scaling back too far. The assessment must be based on credible data in order to serve as a
    solid foundation for all subsequent change management activities. In this regard it can also be helpful to use a tried
    and tested tool.<br />

    <b>5. Conduct Readiness Assessments</b><br />
    Identify the participants who will be asked to complete each tool and work with the client to plan the logistics of
    conducting the assessment. Distribute and collect surveys; conduct interviews and focus groups. Rely as much as
    possible on the client team to perform these steps. Compile the information in usable formats for analysis.<br />
    <b>Tools</b><br />
    Organization Change on ICM AssetWeb:<br />
    Change Management/Reengineering: "Organization Readiness Assessment Fast Path Methodology" (data collection aids)
</p>
<p>
    <b>6. Analyze and Document Readiness Issues</b><br />
    Draw findings and conclusions from all data sources. Prioritize the issues by severity. When writing the report,
    include quotes from interviews and focus groups. If an issue applies only to a particular segment of the population,
    ensure that this is communicated clearly in the report. Many excellent and diverse examples of change readiness
    assessment reports are available in intellectual capital (see Examples section).<br />
    Develop recommended strategies and actions to enhance change enablers, eliminate or reduce barriers, ensure adequate
    sponsorship, build stakeholder commitment and capability to support change, and manage resistance. Include the time
    frame in which the actions should occur. As you develop recommendations, ground them in basic change management
    concepts - the change process, capacity to assimilate change, and critical success factors for change.<br />

    planning tools)
</p>
<p>
    <b>7. Review and Validate with Client</b><br />
    Key client sponsors need to understand the conclusions and evaluate and agree to the recommendations before they are
    carried forward into the subsequent work product, Transition Management Strategy. Prepare for the review by
    anticipating their reactions to the conclusions and increasing your knowledge of and comfort with the supporting data.
    Client team members should be involved in both the development and review of the report.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>8. Reiterate as Needed to Monitor Progress or as New Change Impacts Are Identified</strong><br />
    The integrated transition plan is likely to call for follow-up assessments to check for new issues and verify that
    progress is being made in reducing resistance and removing barriers. An updated assessment may also be warranted if, as
    the project evolves, its impact will be different than initially expected.
