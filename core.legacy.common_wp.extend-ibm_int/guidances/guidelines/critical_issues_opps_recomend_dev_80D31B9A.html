    The development of the Critical Issues Opportunities and Recommendation work product begins in the early stages of the
    engagement.<br />
    The development process has four distinct phases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        1.Capturing issues and opportunities,
    </li>
    <li>
        2.Establishing the current situation. Collecting data that identifies effects of the issues and opportunities to
        the organization
    </li>
    <li>
        3.Building the recommendation
    </li>
    <li>
        4.Identifying the benefits and the interdependencies
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>1.Capturing issues and opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The development of the critical issues and opportunities work product is an iterative process that begins with the
    initial phases of an engagement and is completed when the final deliverables are provided to the customer. Following
    are some specific suggestions of sources and methods for aggregating, documenting and sharing the deliverables:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Issues</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Start with the proposal/scope of work that was used to sell the engagement. Many of the clientâ€™s critical issues
        will be stated there and should be extracted verbatim, if possible, to test for client understanding and
        concurrence. Begin a list of critical issues now and continue to add to it as the engagement activities are
        performed and the work products prepared.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the highlights or summaries of stakeholder interviews. Identify key issues and which stakeholder(s) raised
        them.&nbsp; Make particular note of issues that are commonly mentioned and those that are mentioned only by a
        particular stakeholder or group of stakeholders.&nbsp; Add incremental issues to the list and/or restate proposal
        issues in client terms.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the outputs and proceeding from any client workshops that have been conducted. Identify the proposal and/or
        shareholder issues that were re-enforced by workshop participants.&nbsp; In particular, identify new issues that
        surfaced from the perspective of workshop participants and their source(s).&nbsp; Add new issues to the growing
        list, noting their source (discretely, if necessary).
    </li>
    <li>
        Review customer inputs from satisfaction surveys, complaint records, wants and needs studies and customer
        relationship visits.&nbsp; Identify and list issues from the client's customers' perspective.&nbsp; State these
        issues in the customers' terminology whenever possible.&nbsp; Add them to the list.&nbsp; At this point it may be
        possible to begin to compare and contrast the client's internal view with their customers' or the public's external
        view.
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, review the issues that the consulting team used as a basis for creating their hypotheses.&nbsp; Hopefully,
        there will be a close fit with the most critical or pervasive issues on your list so far.&nbsp; If not, the
        consulting Principal and Engagement Manager should be advised so the project can be realigned with the true issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the aggregated issues in a format that communicates how pervasively they are held and by whom, as well as
        their perceived relative importance to the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the reports and selected proceedings of other Work Products in the investigative phase, paying particular
        attention to analyses of the client's current business processes, organization and information systems.&nbsp;
        Analyze the current process maps to identify problem areas in the operational processes and also in how knowledge
        is managed.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You are looking for specific characteristics or root causes that contribute to the client's critical issues.&nbsp; You
    should also look objectively for constraints to solving critical client issues and ideas or opportunities that surfaced
    during the investigative phase.&nbsp; Begin a list of "opportunity areas" to be used as input to the redesign
    activities to follow.
</p>
<p>
    If "best practice" research or process benchmarking has been performed, it should have yielded some important insights
    into how other companies inside and outside of the client's industry have solved similar issues.&nbsp; These can be
    powerful and compelling additions to your list of opportunities, because they confirm the "art of the possible" with
    significantly better business results.
</p>
<p>
    Return to the customer inputs and if available, summarize those things that the client's customer wants/needs/expects
    from the client that are not being sufficiently provided today.&nbsp; When given the opportunity, client's customers
    will often suggest or prescribe practical solutions that become useful focus areas for redesign.
</p>
<p>
    Summarize areas where there are opportunities to leverage new technologies, for example e-business, not only to fix
    existing problems, but also to change the ways of working.&nbsp; These may have been identified from a technology scan,
    client interviews and workshops or discussions with IBM technical groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Document the aggregated list of opportunity areas in a format that communicates their alignment with critical issues
    and identifies their source by category.&nbsp; Specific quotes from customers, competitors and workshop participants
    can carry much weight if presented discretely.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Establishing the current situation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As the metrics around the process maps are developed and data gathered through out the project, they should be applied
    to the identified issues and opportunities. Representing the issues and opportunities in quantifiable terms presents a
    powerful impetus to the organization to take action.
</p>
<p>
    Quantifiable data would be obtained from metrics around process maps such as cycle times, wait times, internal
    performance indicators, industry benchmarks, and volume analysis. If an activity based costing analysis has been
    conducted, it would provide most of the information needed to support the issues and opportunities and develop
    quantifiable benefits of the recommendations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Building the recommendation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The recommendations to address the critical issues and take advantage of opportunities will be identified at various
    stages in the engagement.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Some will be identified early in the engagement.&nbsp; For example, in workshops to analyze the root causes of process
    problem areas there are often many root causes (that may relate to product / service offerings, policies, processes,
    data, organization structure skills, applications, technology etc.)&nbsp; Similarly, from workshops to brainstorm
    solutions/opportunities for improvement there are often many suggestions... particularly with technologies as an
    opportunity to conduct the business differently.&nbsp; Out of these workshops it is possible to classify the
    problems/root causes as having a low, medium, high impact on the customer (satisfaction), business (strategy), employee
    (satisfaction), business partner (satisfaction), etc.&nbsp; It is also possible to classify the ideas/opportunities
    according to whether they have a low, medium or high cost to implement; and whether they have a low, medium or high
    benefit to the business.&nbsp; It is essential that these problems/opportunities be prioritized/classified in some way,
    including potential "quick wins", and that recommendations are provided to the client.&nbsp; Seeking early feedback
    from senior management will ensure that the inputs to the future process design are in line with the needs of the
    business (e.g. adopting a new technology that requires major investment should be agreed prior to designing the
    process).
</p>
<p>
    The majority of recommendations will be developed during the later stages of an engagement and will typically include
    recommendations on the design of the future process, the introduction of new technologies/systems and changes to the
    organization.&nbsp; In developing recommendations, there are often several options available.&nbsp; The options should
    all be considered and the 'best' option for this client situation recommended.&nbsp; The criteria for determining which
    to recommend will vary from one engagement to another, but will include factors such as relative cost / risk / other
    planned or ongoing initiatives.&nbsp; Any constraints need to be identified, and the risks articulated (risk
    assessment) and managed (risk mitigation).&nbsp; While developing recommendations, the critical issues and
    opportunities provide a reference point on the areas that must be addressed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. Identifying the benefits and interdependencies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Each set of issues, opportunities and recommendations should be supported by a distinct set of benefits. Again, these
    provide the impetus to the organization to take action. Depending upon the stage of the project this section could be
    supported with quantified benefits (always preferred) or state the qualitative improvement that would result by
    implementing the recommendations. They must be focused on the objectives identified by management as the purpose of the
    engagement effort. Where possible they should address:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Effects on cost
    </li>
    <li>
        Effect on customer Value
    </li>
    <li>
        Effects on effort of implementation (cost, time, risk)
    </li>
    <li>
        Effects on other parts of the organization
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The interdependency section identifies the relationships between different recommendations. It highlights the effect
    that not implementing one recommendation would have on the level of benefit the organization would receive from other
    recommendations. If the engagement effort spans across organizational units, this section would identify impact points
    across the organization.<br />
