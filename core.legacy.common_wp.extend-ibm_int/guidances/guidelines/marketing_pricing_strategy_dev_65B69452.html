    Since price interacts with all other elements of the marketing mix, it should always be viewed in the context of an
    overall marketing strategy. Two strategic decisions must be made before determining price. The first is the
    segmentation decision; i.e., the selection of customers to be served.&nbsp; The second is the determination of product
    strategy. The values for target customers must be defined in detail, and the product must be positioned among
    competitive offerings. The role of price within this product strategy can then be defined and will lead to setting
    pricing objectives that are consistent with overall marketing objectives.
</p>
<p>
    Careful analyses of customer needs and of market conditions are necessary inputs to both of these strategic decisions.
    For the specific purposes of pricing strategy, such analysis should include an examination of the full range of
    competitive product offerings and prices and careful assessment of the importance that customers attach to price
    compared with other elements of the product offerings.&nbsp; The objective of these analytical steps is to estimate the
    value of the product to the customer, both economically and psychologically.
</p>
<h4>
    1. Setting goals and objectives
</h4>
<p>
    Before the management team considers pricing, it ought to define the organization’s objectives and determine the ways
    that pricing strategy can contribute to the overall effort. Managers can create a useful framework by answering the
    following questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What do we want to maximize? List the alternatives for strategic focus, such as<br />
        &nbsp;Revenue<br />
        &nbsp;Unit volume<br />
        &nbsp;Market share<br />
        &nbsp;Profit<br />
        &nbsp;Penetration of a new market<br />
        &nbsp;Blocking action against a competitor
    </li>
    <li>
        What market segment are we targeting?
    </li>
    <li>
        What geographic area are we targeting?
    </li>
    <li>
        What other external factors should we consider in our pricing decisions? For example, management may want to
        consider<br />
        &nbsp;The overall economy<br />
        &nbsp;Product life cycle<br />
        &nbsp;Brand
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The answers to these questions become the underlying framework for pricing strategy.
</p>
<h4>
    2. Multi-dimensional approach to pricing
</h4>
<p>
    Pricing can be approached from different directions. Combining approaches using multiple criteria normally leads to a
    successful, multi-dimensional strategy. The classic structures from which pricing elements might be adapted are
    described below.
</p>
<h5>
    Cost-plus pricing
</h5>
<p>
    With the cost-plus approach, management calculates the costs of production, distribution, marketing and overhead and
    then adds on an “acceptable-to-the-board” margin. While this approach might provide profit, it is based on a model
    established early in the industrial age and linked almost inextricably to the concept of economies of scale. With this
    approach, raw material costs and production efficiencies play the central role in determining price.
</p>
<p>
    This approach, while “tried and true” in many regards, lacks the flexibility that management may need to compete
    effectively in modern markets. Today, customer acquisition strategy, “loss-leader” tactics,&nbsp; “do or die”
    promotions, seasonal changes in demand, and the capacity to leverage the outcomes of supply/demand analysis dominate
    much of the thinking about pricing strategy. Many companies today are stressing the need to retain customers for a
    lifetime. Viewing a customer’s business as a lifetime of revenue streams is quite different from viewing it as a single
    profit event.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Value pricing
</h5>
<p>
    Value pricing is based on the premise that the utility of a product or service varies across different buyers. The art
    is in determining just what the variance in utility may be and who will pay at the top end of the range.
</p>
<p>
    An example of a value priced item might be an intimate, luxury consumer item such as perfume or a fine man’s shirt. As
    this kind of product would not generally be viewed as “essential,” what customers are prepared to pay would be based
    primarily on psychosocial factors. On the other hand, value pricing might be applied to AIDS treatment drugs or
    technology that creates a potential “inflection point” for an entire industry. In this case, the motivation to pay
    varies by personal health conditions or fear of being left behind in a new market.
</p>
<p>
    Value pricing is often associated with the recovery of investments in new products. This would include indirect
    development expenses such as patent expenses, legal fees to create licensing agreements and other expenses to bring
    innovative know-how to market for the benefit of customers. Since the innovation typically represents a benefit not
    elsewhere available, buyers tend to place a high value on it. A true correlation does not exist between perceived value
    and the combined factors of raw materials and production efficiencies.
</p>
<p>
    In most cases, value pricing revolves around brand, the classic example being the clothing industry. Buyers perceive
    “something” that makes one brand more desirable than another brand. In most cases, that “something” is the result of
    extremely hard work by marketing decision-makers. Strong pricing follows strong brands.
</p>
<p>
    Another example is the music industry, where recording companies invest to build the “brands” of the musicians with
    whom they have contracts. While pricing is fairly constant across the industry, companies can drive higher volumes if
    they have contracts with popular performers. Recording companies operate outside traditional advertising channels to
    increase awareness of and desire for “their” musicians’ offerings. While technology has presented potential changes to
    the ways music may be distributed in the future, it is likely that branding will continue to play a large role in the
    industry and that some musicians will continue to be perceived as more valuable than others.
</p>
<h5>
    Competitive and comparative pricing
</h5>
<p>
    In many cases, companies will simply follow pricing established by others. While this may not constitute a pro-active
    “pricing strategy,” it serves the purpose of avoiding a huge variance with the market at large. Nevertheless, with
    market forces at work in the global economy, profit margins are growing narrower. Any approach involving only the
    mechanical duplication of others’ pricing will likely lead to sub-par financial performance. Marketing decision-makers
    should take a pro-active stance to seize the advantage when pricing situations or other factors in the market
    environment change.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Duplication of others’ pricing presents risks of another kind. Competitors may not have achieved optimal pricing. Their
    research may be flawed. Their production methods or service delivery systems may be inefficient. And they may also be
    playing the following game, which leads to stagnation over the long run.
</p>
<h5>
    Intuitive pricing
</h5>
<p>
    In many situations, a company has only a short time horizon and limited information during the pricing decision
    process. The managers are forced to make a decision with the information they have—the opinions of a small sample of
    buyers and their own intuition. While circumstances may sometimes dictate such a pricing practice, management should
    make every effort to avoid this practice. Even a modicum of research can yield helpful information for pricing
    decisions.
</p>
<p>
    Intuitive pricing can lead to significant gaps in pricing between competing companies. The resulting wide price
    variations are not good for consumer trust. Eventually, competitive forces will narrow the gap between the highest and
    lowest price offerings. Unless the offerings are pure commodity, the forces of branding will surface to provide the
    primary differentiating effect.
</p>
<h5>
    Price skimming
</h5>
<p>
    Price skimming involves a policy of differentiating between market segments based on their willingness to pay maximum
    prices. As the company satisfies the demand in one segment, it lowers the price and moves on to another segment that is
    less sensitive to pricing. Companies employing this practice successively “skim” profits from the different segments
    until margins grow excessively narrow.&nbsp; Companies use this approach to recover the cost of development, to exploit
    situations where supplies are low, to leverage innovative offerings based on technology or other design advantages, or
    to exploit a brand that is perceived as valuable.
</p>
<p>
    Price skimming differs from value pricing.&nbsp; Price skimming involves the exploitation of different segments using a
    single offering. With value pricing, the company identifies the segments where its offerings will be most valued and
    focuses on that segment over the long term.
</p>
<h5>
    Penetration pricing
</h5>
<p>
    A company will employ penetration pricing when it is entering a new market and is attempting to establish a presence.
    As its position in the new market becomes more secure, it raises prices to normal levels.
</p>
<h5>
    Controlled or monitored pricing
</h5>
<p>
    In many environments, price is controlled directly by government or monitored by quasi-government entities. In this
    environment, management must balance the demands of the private sector against the requirements of public overseers.
    Managers are advised to seek help from specialists in this situation due to the complexity of issues ranging from
    pricing to value delivery to arbitration regarding regulations. Examples of regulatory offices with which a company
    might have dealings in the United Kingdom are OFWAT and OFTEL, regulators for the water and telecommunications
    industries, respectively.
</p>
<p>
    In a regulated situation, managers must understand not only their cost structures and customers’ key drivers, but they
    also must know every niche where they can find profit. A framework of public oversight adds considerably to the
    challenge of widening margins through “niche” or target segment based pricing.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the industry and the nature of regulation, companies will face different kinds of challenges with respect
    to establishing mark-up, leveraging a strong brand, or adjusting for price sensitivity among segments.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    3. Steps in determining price
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Decide upon marketing mix issues such as product or service quality, the portfolio of offerings, positioning, and
        distribution channels.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine pricing objectives, considering the alternative pricing approaches and how they might be integrated for
        optimal pricing decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assess demand for the offering. Determine general price sensitivity in the target segments in order to project the
        impact of pricing on ultimate revenues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test different price points with buyers—customers and potential customers. Many companies will turn to marketing
        strategy advisors or market research firms to provide objective insight into buyers’ attitudes and behaviors. Many
        methods are available to estimate price response; e.g., management might conduct surveys or pricing experiments.
        Market research might also take the form of conjoint analysis, which measures price response in terms of such
        disparate elements as brand image and technical features.
    </li>
    <li>
        Estimate costs. While cost-plus pricing should not be the only pricing approach management applies, it provides a
        beginning reference point. At a minimum, the company should attempt to charge a price that covers its cost of
        producing, distributing and selling the product at a fair return and with reasonable risk. This is not an absolute,
        however. Issues of market penetration or blocking actions against competitors raise issues beyond cost.
        Nevertheless, management must have a tight grasp of production and distribution costs in order to conduct
        meaningful discussions about alternative pricing approaches.
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze competitors’ prices. Competitors' current prices and possible reactions to the company’s pricing structure
        play a key role in the pricing decision.&nbsp; Management should know not only the price but also the quality,
        distribution channels and promotion tactics that competitors are employing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select the primary pricing approach. For example, the primary approach might be cost-plus pricing, modified to
        leverage a perception of high brand value in the market, such as automobile manufacturers using identical chassis
        in luxury cars as in standard models. Another example might be a primary approach of skimming modified to leverage
        favorable government regulations, such as tobacco farmers in the United States are skimming value from those crops
        to take advantage of subsidies that most likely will eventually fade away.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select the offering price. The company selects the final price, ensuring that the price element is coordinated with
        the other elements in the marketing mix.
    </li>
    <li>
        Monitor results. Understand why customers switch. Do they switch because of price or do other factors play a role?
        What changes have occurred as a result of a price change? Have lower prices increased unit sales? Higher prices
        decreased them? Survey the market to determine associations between pricing and brand perceptions.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    4. Pricing strategy issues
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Global operators must decide how they will vary pricing in different geographical markets. This will typically
        involve the full range of financial analysis covering such matters as production costs, transportation costs,
        international tariffs, market penetration objectives and other factors.
    </li>
    <li>
        Special promotions involving such tactics as discounts, cash rebates and other “value adds” are short-term
        initiatives, normally aimed at encouraging trial by non-customers. They do not work particularly well for building
        loyalty among existing customers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Companies may distinguish among customer segments for purposes of pricing, but they must ensure that distinctions
        do not become improper discrimination as defined by government regulation or common ethics.
    </li>
    <li>
        When pricing against competitors, management teams must take the time to assess strategic implications of pricing
        actions. Managers should delineate the reasons for their actions and the probable reactions by competitors. They
        should calculate the downside if they are wrong and the upside if they are correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Internet has caused changes in pricing strategies by revealing to buyers vast sources of information. Every
        wrinkle, every inconsistency, every instance of overreaching can potentially be revealed for all to see. Companies
        must press to achieve standard pricing structures across on-line and off-line channels.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    5. Trends and future mapping
</h4>
<p>
    Successful marketing decision-makers capture past and present trends and use them to make pricing decisions. They will
    assess a wide range of variables that may affect the outcome of pricing actions; for example, changes in buyer
    behavior, new technologies, the economy, and new competitors. Factors such as these, combined with the pricing actions
    of the past, should play a role in shaping future pricing decisions.
</p>
<p>
    Computing technology has greatly enhanced the art of scenario planning, a means for selecting alternate possible
    futures. Managers can increasingly weigh the alternatives presented and, through advanced techniques for assessing
    probabilities, optimize pricing decisions.
