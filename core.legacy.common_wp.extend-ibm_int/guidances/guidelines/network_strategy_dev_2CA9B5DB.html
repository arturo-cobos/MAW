        The first activity in developing a network strategy is to gather data about the client business environment and
        business strategy. If this data has already been captured as part of an earlier IGS engagement, then this
        information will only need to be reviewed. If this information has not been captured, then the consultant team will
        need to understand the following (as each is impacted by a possibly changed network environment):
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>
                    business strategies
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    goals/objectives
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    priorities
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    critical success factors
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    core competencies
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    required capabilities
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
    Techniques to use in the gathering of this information would include reviewing industry journals and client business
    and I/T plans, as well as interviewing key client management executives, to determine the client business priorities,
    strategic direction, and short and long term initiatives. This will allow certain pieces of information to be
    determined, such as anticipated obstacles, information/data distribution, and the criticality of the network in being
    able to meet the business strategy. This will result in the required business/network enablers and prioritized criteria
    upon which to judge the ultimate network architecture and design.
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        The second activity is to gather data about the networking environment and resources. If this information had not
        already been captured, then the following will need to be understood:<br />
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>
                    existing investment in networking.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    adequacy to deploy business strategy.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    funding priorities.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    networking competencies.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    process management.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    skills and staffing.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
    The team can then determine strategic deficiencies, functionality requirements, and immediate changes.<br />
    This information can be determined through a review of application plans, networking plans, and budgetary/costing
    information, as well as interviews of keys networking and IT management. This will result in the creation of the
    requirements for information distribution, the beginning of a functional and technical set of specifications, and a
    positioning of the network as an investment â€“ not a cost.
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        The third activity is to gather data about the competitor's use of networking as well as technology trends in the
        networking industry and the client industry. Tasks would include identifying:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>
                    significant potential uses of networking.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    industry uses of networking.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    competitors use of networking.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    trends in networking technology.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
    This information can come from industry literature (numerous networking weekly newspapers like Communications Week or
    monthly networking magazines like Business Communications Review), company specific research from the Internet on the
    use of networking by competitors or the industry, and IBM Research & Development.<br />
    This will allow the team to produce the following as it relates to the Network Strategy: long term networking
    investment opportunities, technology positioning, and industry network spending benchmarks.
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        The final step is building the network strategy. The following tasks provide a framework for defining a Network
        Strategy:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Determine which business strategies should be the key driver of networking resources.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Determine how the role of networking needs to change (e.g., raise it to policy level).
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Review with key decision makers how linkage to business drivers was determined for each high-value
                    opportunities.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Review the recommended core competencies required.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Review and refine the list of required new technologies.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Assess whether the technology/skills could be outsourced.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Assess potential cost savings of outsourcing non-strategic resources.

            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Verify that the client is willing to accept the implications (including associated risks) of the
                    recommended initiatives.

            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Determine if more aggressive investments will reduce the time required to capitalize on new networking
                    opportunities.

            </li>
            <li>
