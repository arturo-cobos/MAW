    The CVM specialist class provides detailed techniques for a Customer Wants and Needs engagement&nbsp; including unique
    CVM focus group facilitation methods, that probe each MOT (moment of truth) interaction within the engagement scope to
    identify not only WHAT customers want, but WHY.
</p>
<p>
    The "why" (or value/benefit they can receive) is then made the focus of visioning exercises that identify creative new
    ways to deliver that value and differentiate the client’s product/service.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Define the Project Objectives and Data Sources to be Used</strong><br />
        The first step of any project of this type is to ensure the objectives are clear and then to build issue-based
        hypotheses, which will be proved or disproved. With the hypotheses articulated, the practitioner should map out the
        questions that must be asked to validate the hypotheses and identify the appropriate sources. In the case of
        customer wants and needs, customers and potential customers should always be included in the sources.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify All Customer Touchpoints<br />
        </strong> In order to ensure that all customer wants and needs are explored, all touchpoints with the customer
        should be identified (think about the interactions customers may have) and make a first cut at prioritizing their
        importance.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Collect Data from Customers</strong><br />
        This data will come from focus groups and/or surveys. In some cases, focus groups may have to be the extent of data
        collection. This is acceptable, but it is important to ensure that all customer groups are represented through data
        collection, including those with disabilities. It is also very important that those customers and potential
        customers selected to participate are representative of their segment as is possible and that more than one focus
        group is conducted with each customer segment.&nbsp; The special needs (large print, sign language interpretation,
        etc.) of the participants may need to be considered.<br />
        A more statistically sound method of determining the importance of wants and needs is conducting a survey and draw
        information from hundreds of customers and potential customers. With this amount of data, the responses can be
        statistically tested to discover which wants and needs drive customers up the loyalty curve. The collected data can
        be prioritized by level of importance.&nbsp; Responses on the extreme ends of the priority scale should not be
        discarded.&nbsp; Instead, these responses should be carefully considered.<br />
        <strong>3A. Collect Industry or Best Practice Data (if necessary)<br />
        </strong> In some cases, the practitioner will want to measure the differences or gaps between the client’s
        performance on each want and need longitudinally or in comparison to the industry leader or perhaps the industry
        average. These data should be located while the survey is in the field.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Check the Strategic Alignment of the Wants and Needs with Business Drivers</strong><br />
        With the data (from focus groups or surveys) in hand, compare the alignment of the customer’s wants and needs with
        the elements that are considered the Business Drivers. This exercise will illuminate where business processes are
        not supporting meeting customer wants and needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify Business Process Characteristics and Compare with the Ideal, Identify Gaps and Prioritize<br />
        </strong> List the few things that MUST be done and which your business processes must be capable of doing. Define
        the dependencies or prerequisites that must be present in the business infrastructure to support or enable the
        essential capabilities, such as organizations/people, skills/resources, policies/practices, information or
        information technology, and management/measurement systems. Having identified these elements, the practitioner can
        identify and measure the gaps between the current and ideal or desired state; then, the priorities of which gaps to
        address can be set.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Knowing Priorities and Capabilities, Make Recommendations</strong><br />
        With all the information collected through this process, the team can help the client see all the opportunities
        which exist to address customer wants and needs and improve what the company provides to the customer. It is then
        the job of the IBM team to help the client make the investments that will give the greatest return.<br />
