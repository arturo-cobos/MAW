    <b><i>Enterprise</i></b><b><i>Level Test Measurements:</i></b><br />
    The organization should embark on a formal program (with committed executive sponsorship) to improve the effectiveness
    and capability of its testing and quality management functions, firstly through an inward assessment and focus, and
    secondly through benchmarking itself against companies in a similar demographic sector.<br />
</p>
<p>
    One useful model for initiating this exercise is the Testing Maturity Model (aligned with the SEI Capability Maturity
    Model) which may be used as a foundation by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            an internal assessment team to identify the current testing capability state.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            upper management to initiate a testing improvement program.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            development teams to improve testing capability.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            users and clients to define their role in the testing process.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Please refer to the publication “Developing a Testing Maturity Model” by Ilene Burnstein, Taratip Suwannasart,
            and C.R. Carlson, from the lllinois Institute of Technology for further information on the TMM
            (http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/1996/aug/developi.asp).
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify the CSFs that need to be achieved in order for the Testing and Quality Management organization to be
        successful, e.g. in terms of ROI, effectiveness in ensuring defect-free deliverables for the enterprise,
        competitiveness in Testing best practice compared to other organizations of similar demographic nature.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Through analysis of previous Test Measurements (if any), Test Results, Defect Log and Production Problem Logs,
        identify the problematic areas that could be caused by inefficiencies in the testing process (e.g. using root cause
        analysis).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze the output from 2 and 3, and determine from Test Management and other stakeholders what information would
        be helpful in meeting these CSFs and resolving the weaknesses in the testing cycle.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze the Test Measurements in conjunction with metrics from the other domains to establish where the development
        lifecycle processes could be improved and feed back to the owners of, e.g. project management or application
        development domains.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify what statistics/metrics/measurements would contribute to making this information viable and accurate; and
        how, when and by whom they should be collected during the testing process by the projects.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Create the Test Measurements policies, processes and guidelines to facilitate the collection, collating, analysis
        and presentation of this information; and communicate it formally throughout the IT organization for
        adoption.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        As each testing project completes, gather the Test Measurements into the corporate repository and use it on an
        enterprise level to provide information to the management of the Testing and Quality Management functions in order
        that they can use this to improve the effectiveness and capability of the Testing organization.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The enterprise Test Measurements may also be used during the testing project by Test Management to monitor the
        emerging trends and to flag any extraordinary exceptions which may bring specific risk to the project.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Select and procure a set of reporting/graphics tools that allows creation of procedures/macros that can be
        automatically executed by both test management and the testing team to produce standard reports to encourage
        consistency of presentation and familiarity with the Test Measurements&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        More information is also available in the Test Method Task “Analyze Overall Testing Effectiveness”.<br />
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <b><i>Project Level Test Measurements:</i></b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Consult the enterprise Test Measurements policy, processes and guidelines to establish which measurements
            should be collected throughout the Testing project, when they should be collected and by whom. There may be a
            list of mandatory vs. optional requirements specified.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Review the Testing Project list of Work Products, Activities and Tasks that have been selected for the project,
            and identify where and by whom the Test Measurements may be created and documented.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Review any problematic areas (from the risk assessment and previous projects) and ensure that the Test
            Measurements will cover the gathering of data to address these areas. If the cause or root of the problems
            originate from other disciplines or domains, ensure that sufficient interface allows for correct action to be
            taken, even if outside the test domain.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Review the CSFs defined by the organization and ensure that the Test Measurements will contribute to the
            achieving of these CSFs or CSFs specific to this project
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Review the enterprise Test Measurements that already exist and ensure that the measurements from this project
            will contribute to, be consistent with and easily merge with the corporate information
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Ensure that the activities to collect, collate, analyze and use the Test Measurements are included and
            scheduled as a vital component of the Test Project during project planning and satisfy 1-4 above.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Use the sample Measurements Section Table of Contents in Section 6 (Example) as a checklist or prompt for
            identifying types of Test Measurements to be produced.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The techniques for collecting the actual Test Measurements are documented in the Tasks related to the Testing
            Activities and are not repeated here (to ensure consistency with the Test Method).
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Using dummy metrics or metrics from previous projects, mock up a few “prototype” measurements, measurement
            summaries and graphs to ensure that the right output can be derived once the metrics are collected.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Collect, collate, sort and store the raw Test Measurements in a relational database or corporate repository
            where they may be indexed uniquely for easy reference, and preferably supported by relevant testing tools or
            reporting tools (e.g. SAS).
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Throughout the lifecycle of the testing project, however small or even if just one phase, refer
            <u>continuously</u> to the Test Measurements in order to (1) monitor the progress/status of the project (2)
            track achievement vs. the Quality objectives and (3) identify and rectify any testing weaknesses/issues
            <u>before</u> the end of the project or phase
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Any failure in meeting the project schedules or quality and testing objectives should be noted and escalated to
            Test Management for further action.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Communicate the Test Measurements widely to all relevant stakeholders during the project so that any corrective
            action, process improvements, may be understood and incorporated into the testing project plan.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            At the end of the testing project, collate, organize and document clearly the Test Measurements for hand-over
            to the Testing organization for trend analysis, management decision making on improving the testing process and
            function and communication of lessons learned.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            In addition, the Test Measurements must be transferred to the Application Maintenance team for enhancement and
            updates during the life of the application. This will help them in estimating their testing effort in
            Maintenance and also provide a foundation for their Defect and Quality management activities.
