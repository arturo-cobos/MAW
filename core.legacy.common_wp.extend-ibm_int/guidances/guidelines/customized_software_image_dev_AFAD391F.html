    The creation of a customized software image may be the responsibility of the client, or created by IBM for the
    client.&nbsp; In either case a Customized Software Image Configuration Checklist which specifies what should be
    contained on the image, and what the configuration of the hardware is presumed to be, must have been created.&nbsp;
    This list documents some basic image information as well as what is considered important by the client at the time of
    image creation.&nbsp; This information may become important if changes to the image or equipment being deployed become
    necessary during the deployment, and may determine if a change request is warranted. This information may have been
    documented at various places in the project, but it is important that the PM determine that it has been documented
    prior to deploying the image.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A Client Created Image</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If the client is developing the image and will hand it over to IBM for deployment, the project team should validate the
    image against the Configuration Checklist, and against testing criteria established to mirror the real world
    deployment.&nbsp; Usually this involves creating a test lab that closely resembles the configuration center, or the
    client site, and loading the image upon representative models of the equipment being deployed.&nbsp; Detailed testing
    criteria must be developed, scripted, and performed before any image should be deployed to the field.&nbsp; The client
    should sign off on the image and its validity against the configuration checklist.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>An IBM Project Team Created Image</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If the IBM Project Team will be responsible for creation of the image, the Configuration Checklist should be filled out
    and signed off by the client prior to image creation.&nbsp; This list is then used to gather all applicable software
    (often supplied by the client).
</p>
<p>
    Once the software has been gathered, a representative piece of equipment is employed as the base machine and all
    software is loaded upon it.&nbsp; Client configurations, as specified upon the configuration checklist, are
    performed.&nbsp; These configurations can include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What user rights/privileges should be included on the image.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Communications protocols.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Encryption levels/requirements.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Firewall and Antivirus settings.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What icons should appear on the desktop.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Internet/Intranet configurations.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Any other relevant issues, settings, or policies that are to be deployed via the image.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the software is loaded and configured, it is often necessary to remove user specific information that was
    necessary to achieve the load.&nbsp; This may be contained in a number of places, depending on the process of loading
    the machines and the software employed.&nbsp; This information is usually limited to a user name and password, a
    machine identification number, and a dated load session file.&nbsp; These items (and any others) are removed and/or
    replaced with generic information.&nbsp; It is also often necessary to reset the user rights to those appropriate to
    the end users.
</p>
<p>
    An image file is then created via a software product (e.g. Symantec Ghost) and stored on portable or transferable
    medium such as a Compact Disc or a Server.
</p>
<p>
    Once the image is in the proper format and stored on the appropriate medium, it is tested against the project
    established test criteria.&nbsp; If the image passes the test criteria and validation against the configuration
    checklist it is presented to the client for acceptance.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the deployment method, multiple copies of the image are often created for use by the Integration Center
    and the Deployment team.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least one copy is kept at the project office for the creation of more copies or
    for troubleshooting of deployment issues.<br />
