            current usage and access patterns, trends/changes, etc.? How are they prioritized? What is their functional
            reading level? Language? What are their web usage characteristics (e.g., “Browsers,” “Searchers,” “Transaction
            oriented?” Do they prefer to read online? Print? Download? Do they want to see only information that pertains
            to their interests? Do we know the web use satisfiers and/or dis-satisfiers ?, etc., etc.) Any or all of this
            information will help define the user and their requirements.

    <li>
        <div>
            <b>User Tasks</b> - What does a user come to the site to do (e.g. retrieve information to include in a
            proposal, find out what is reimbursed, determine spending guidelines, purchase a gift, etc.)? Define and
            prioritize all tasks for each user group. What content/information is required to complete each of these tasks?

            practices? Does the audience consider the provider a best-of-breed publisher? Why or why not? <u>Site Branding,
            Customer Relationship, or Image creation</u> – are these defined and available? Are there policies, which must
            be followed, guidelines, which must be reviewed, relationship plans, segmentation analyses, audience strategy
            documents, style guides, communications guides, or other references, which must be factored into the content
            selection and ultimate design and delivery?

    <b>Content Information Architecture</b> – is an <i>emerging discipline</i> that reflects a broad base of skills and
    disciplines. It combines traditional Library/Information Science with technology, user characteristics, learning
    behaviors, and psychology with data analysis and classification, etc. It is at least as much art as science, and it
    establishes the context and the views of content that make it accessible and give it value.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Today, many current web sites have an “accidental” or “inherited” architecture. The site organization, classification
    and navigation may simply reflect the background of the initial site designer, with no conscious effort to plan the
    content, its structure, the supporting functions, etc., to the user needs or the business objectives. Or, the content
    may be organized around an organization’s current structure, by business units or ‘silo’s’, or the content may reflect
    the organization of the original media in which it was created, e.g., a book, flyer, memo, etc.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    In any event, a robust information architecture is a pre-requisite to manage the explosion of content required to
    support dynamic publishing and/or transaction enabled web environments. That does not mean, however, that all of the
    elements of a robust Information Architecture can be expected to “burst full-grown” into existence. Rather, the
    following elements will be initially defined at the higher levels, and will deepen and develop into maturity over time.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Overall content topology</b> – defines the site context, general Site Map, and expected vitality. What is
            planned range of the content? The breadth? The depth? Is equal depth required across the breadth of the site?
            Is there a parent site? Sibling sites? Progeny sites? Peers that require linkages or relationships, that may
            have independently developed Information Architectures, etc.? Given the defined purpose(s), audience
            information and business objectives for this site, what is the expected “Hit” rates? What kind of growth is
            expected in “hits?” Over what time period ? What is the growth rate in Content? What triggers changes? How
            frequently? Are there transactional needs? What are the key measures?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Common Vocabulary</b> – is a necessary pre-requisite to developing an effective Information Architecture.
            This establishes the core lexicon and definitions that will be used by all content owners, authors, designers,
            etc., and acceptance of this Common Vocabulary is critical.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        In the case of mergers, acquisitions, re-organizations, or an organization, which has many business units, absence
        of this unit may have severe repercussions in misunderstandings, delays, and general “semantic confusion.” Today,
        the majority of the Information Architecture and web terms used do not have a general, agreed to meaning. This is a
        critical success factor.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Classification and labeling</b> - (May also be called grouping, organizing, indexing, schemas, etc.) Samples
            of classification include: Hierarchical, alphabetical, chronological, geographical, topical, task-oriented,
            audience-oriented, etc.

    <p>
        Given all of those choices (and more), and based on user tasks, what is the primary way content will be grouped to
        logically allow the audience to navigate the site and access the content? Where can like sets of content be
        combined? How does the audience refer to this grouping of content (e.g. marketing materials, beauty care products,
        etc.)? Is that terminology the most appropriate way to refer to the content on the site? If not, what is?
    </p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
    <p>
        Based on the audience and task priorities, what content should be placed at the highest levels of the site? What
        content are users willing to spend more time to search for and can be placed lower on the site?
    </p>
    <p>
        What alternate content access indices are necessary to offer alternate “quick paths” to information that is lower
        on the site structure? What cross-references? What links? What synonyms exist? What are the antonyms? Are there any
        homonyms that can cause confusion? Is there a need for thesauri?

            Specifically, the following types of navigation are available:

            <li>
                <div>
                    <i>Global navigation</i> <b>–</b> common at a site level, inherited from a parent level, these
                    constructs are available consistently across all siblings and progeny. Where possible, they should be
                    consistent with peer sites.

            <li>
                <div>
                    <i>Hierarchical navigation –</i> is the path the user is expected to follow to execute the specifically
                    identified tasks, as step 1, step 2 , etc.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    <i>Contextual Navigation –</i> offers an alternate path to content, and is usually entered once the
                    user has identified a first content element of interest. Contextual navigation is directly dependent on
                    alternate indices and cross-references.

            <li>
                <div>
                    <i>Supplemental Navigation –</i> offers specialized alternate paths to content, and may reflect a
                    choice provided to support a sub-set of the audience with different retrieval preferences or needs,
                    e.g., Site Maps, Tables of Contents, user-type specific guides, etc.

            content structures and their elements? If there is a Content Requirement for a News Brief, what specifically is
            included in that? What are the specific attributes required for the selected content, e.g. photo resolution,
            view, version, etc. Note: this is not the design of the page, but a layout of the content that is required on

            content destination routing (e.g., to a FAX, email, distribution list, etc), subscription, alternate
            formatting, advertising support, etc.) and how will they be used on the site? . What process and format is used

            <b>Technology Requirements</b> – What are the key technology requirements to build, develop and operate the
            site – usage of frames, XML, templates, etc. What process and format is used to define and submit these
            requirements? What information is required from the Information Architecture for use by the Data Architects?
            The Application Architects? Developers? What style guides, templates, meta-data constructs (e.g. DTD’s) must be
            defined? When, where and by whom will these be created? Where will these be stored?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Content Migration</b> – For <i>needed</i> legacy content, by whom and how will it be addressed? Where are
            the templates, style sheets, guides and/or tools to transform <i>needed</i> current static content for a
            dynamic environment? How will the content be identified? Extracted? Converted or transcoded? Classified and
            indexed within the information architecture?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Content Design and Delivery Mapping</b> – for the Web, is also very much a <i>rapidly changing</i> <i>and emerging
    discipline</i>. It encompasses extended graphic design (art, photo, video), new content type design (audio, composite
    multi-media entities, hot-spots, “liquid” banners, etc.), design effectiveness (based on usability & ease of use,
    customer satisfaction, comprehension, retention, measured results, etc.), traditional layout and design, application
    design, application integration, branding and image tactical delivery, etc.
</p>
<p>
    In a task or results-oriented web design, the expectation is that each ‘click-point’ has a specific purpose and
    anticipated, potentially measurable outcome. Effective web design points and success factors are still emerging, and
    both the Information Architect and the Content Designer must attempt to “stay ahead of the wave” of these. For example,
    e.g. 40% of first-time web visitors will never return if they do not find meaningful content within 4 clicks.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In addition, the Content Designer must address design and delivery mapping for much more than the site. Design skills
    must be applied, on an increasingly modular and granular level, as content progresses from a static “whole page, or
    document” publishing model to dynamically constructed page and document model.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    This means that the Content Designer must be involved first, in the design of the specific Site and Page elements
    (Page, Header, Nav Bar, Footer, Section, Sub-section, segment, element). Next, they must be involved in the formatting
    design of individually purposeful content structures, e.g. News Brief, Product Information, Hints and Tips, Frequently
    Asked Questions, etc. Finally, design is required for the individual parts of those content structures, e.g., overall
    News Brief, built of Headline, Sub-head, optional picture/art, caption, optional audio and/or video window, optional
    “hot-spots,” etc.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Because this area is so “young,” the burden frequently falls on the Content Designer to align user tasks with business
    objectives, marry them to the Content Placement Plan provided by the Information Architect, and then provide all of the
    templates and structures to deliver the final product. In situations where publishing processes are still loosely or
    poorly defined, the designer may become responsible for maintaining the integrity of the look and feel of the site
    (Quality Control).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Site Design Delivery Guidelines</b> – define the tactical design choices that support the purpose, audience,
            and tasks for the particular audience, within the separately defined presentation philosophy and strategy. The
            general philosophy and strategy may be defined by the organization’s branding group, an advertising agency,
            corporate public relations or communications groups, or may have been overlooked. If it does not exist, it
            falls entirely to the Web Content Designer to develop and deliver a cohesive Web Presentation strategy.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Content Design Delivery Maps (Layouts)</b> – defines the actual content design and layout, and the
            implementation that establishes the “look and feel” of the content as defined by the Information Architect in
            the Content Placement Plan. It includes items such as the explicit size, placement, fonts, colors, shading,
            boxing, options, and relationship to other objects.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        There may be multiple versions of these Maps (Layouts), as the web continues to evolve and support multiple
        destination devices. Unique Content Delivery Maps must be created for unique destinations, such as standard
        desktops, vs. Pervasive Devices, e.g. Palm Pilot’s or cell phones. As new technologies emerge, design must expand
        to accommodate it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately, in a fully dynamic publishing model, this degree of detail must be provided for each finite, uniquely
        definable content element or fragment that is defined by the Information Architect.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Content Templates, style files and tools</b> – are created by the designer to facilitate consistency in
            implementation. They may be as simple, initially, as skeleton documents with locations for content creators or
            editors to place actual content; or they may be customized “master” files which prompt the user (author,
            editor) through the input of content. Automated tools that combine access to the full inventory of defined
            named styles, formats, and elements, can be used to interactively prompt the user for not only the content
            itself, but also for the variables that drive automated selection of the appropriate style resources.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Resource Specifications –</b> define specifically the standard resources libraries and the available
            resources to actually assemble and deliver the content. This includes fonts, standard graphics and/or logo’s,
            navigation graphic files, named styles, shading patterns, etc.
