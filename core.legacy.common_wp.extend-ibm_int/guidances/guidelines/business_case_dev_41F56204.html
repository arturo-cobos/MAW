    In the Proposal and Initialization phases of an engagement, the team will typically develop a financial assessment
    (financial imperatives and boundaries) and financial benchmarks (value targets). These, together with the strategic
    assessment work products provide the "Value Hypotheses" (drivers hypotheses) which are accepted or rejected based on
    the financial analysis undertaken as specified in the financial work plan. The completed financial model provides the
    material required to produce the <b>Business Case</b> work product.
</p>
<p>

    <br />
    The Baseline Financials associated with the <b>"current" assessment</b> are compared to the financials associated with
    the "future" vision, to calculate the cash flow implications (Returns, Resources, and Risk Analysis). The process of
    arriving at the <b>Business Case (including prioritization of recommendations)</b> is conceptually shown here.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Valuation Techniques: DCF, NPV, IRR</b> -- Every CFO, will expect you to present cash flow estimates associated with
    each recommendation for the life of the recommended assets and to calculate the net present value (NPV) resulting from
    those cash flows. Most clients will have adopted a corporate discount rate to be used to discount the cash flow (DCF)
    so as to arrive at NPV valuation; simply ask a senior financial executive for the “discount rate” number. (Typically,
    corporations use an inappropriately high discount rate. However, given the high uncertainty in most business
    transformation cash flow projections, whatever rate the client has adopted for other purposes should be accepted by the
    team.) While NPV is the generally accepted tool for project valuation, you should also plan on calculating both IRR and
    "pay-back period"; for many projects these are equally valid and typically simpler to present and visualize.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Activity-Based Costing –</b> ABC is a powerful tool for truly understanding the economics behind your
    recommendations. Please refer to <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.legacy.common_wp.extend-ibm_int/guidances/supportingmaterials/activity_based_costing_A6FD77CA.html" guid="_DdwC0DMiEd261rFYA7Y8NQ">Activity-Based Costing (ABC)</a>&nbsp;for a step-by-step approach to developing,
    interpreting and presenting ABC Analysis. For a more in-depth discussion, please refer to the books listed in the
    references segment.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Scenarios & Sensitivity Analysis --</b> Typical business cases need to consider operating scenarios and
    sensitivity analyses. These primarily involve answers to relatively simple questions such as “If we implement the
    recommendation, how does this compare to “as is” if demand surges 15% or declines 15% or if we are forced to lower
    prices 20%?” As shown in Activity-Based Costing<b>,</b> the understanding of activity and cost drivers provided by
    Activity-Based Costing work make sensitivity analysis very straightforward.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Risk Assessment</b> -- There are many approaches to assessing and quantifying risks. Clients frequently have their
    own preferred approach; you will want to inquire about this early in the engagement. IBM has never adopted a default
    approach for consulting. Please refer to the <i>example,</i> cited above, for one method that is both useful and
    straightforward.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Real Options --</b> In an increasingly complex and uncertain world conventional valuation techniques discussed above
    do not adequately reflect the sophisticated decisions many businesses have to make when reengineering or restructuring
    their IT infrastructure. It is frequently useful to structure these business decisions as <u>real options</u> and apply
    the cutting-edge tools of financial options theory to their assessment. The mechanics of real options analysis is
    thoroughly explained in <b>Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World</b> by Martha Amram and
    Nalin Kalatilaka (See references, below.) They list 6 types of decision situations in which options theory is
    appropriate, and in which conventional NPV analysis can give misleading results: 1) wait-to-invest options, 2) growth
    options, 3) flexibility options, 4) exit options, and 5) learning options. In certain capital-intensive industries,
    operating under great uncertainty, like mining and petroleum, real options are already frequently used. In other
    industries, clients will seldom demand that you be familiar with this technique.
</p>
<p>
    Development of the Business Case is the responsibility of the Project Team, with the assistance of client financial
    personnel. The development of the financial calculations is the responsibility of the Project Team with the guidance
    and oversight of client financial personnel.
