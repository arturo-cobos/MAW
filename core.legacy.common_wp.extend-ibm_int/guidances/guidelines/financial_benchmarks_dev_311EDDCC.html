    Basic Financial Ratio Benchmarks and Analysis of Their Trends – Creating the Financial Benchmarks work product requires
    6 steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify what is to be bench-marked (specific ratios),
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify comparative companies [or organizational units within the target company; e.g., profit centers],
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine data collection method and collect data,
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine current performance gap,
    </li>
    <li>
        Project future performance levels,
    </li>
    <li>
        Communicate benchmarking findings and gain acceptance.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Identify what is to be benchmarked</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When we identify what is to be benchmarked (specific ratios), we are typically limited to that subset of the data used
    in constructing the Financial Assessment work product that is available from public sources.&nbsp; For US-based “public
    companies,” all of the most basic financial metrics will be available in SEC filings; e.g,. 10-K and 10-Q.&nbsp;
    Industry norms are also important benchmarks.&nbsp; For many industries, mean, mode and median values (as well as
    standard deviations of these) are available for the industry, (as a whole and for major segments,) from a trade
    association.&nbsp; In most cases, you’ll want to collect historical data at the same time you’re collecting current
    data to save duplication of effort.&nbsp; While the relevant time period will depend on the specific variable,
    industry, and company, a good rule of thumb is to collect ten years of quarterly data if the company has been in
    business that long. [That’s plenty of time to see the impact of typical environmental factors and management decisions.
    Change has become so rapid that few industries rely on trend data over ten years old.]&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Identify comparative companies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When we seek to identify comparative companies (or organizational units within the client company; e.g., profit
    centers) you will want to take a cursory look at all of the direct competitors as well as other respected firms
    carrying out substantially the same value-added processes.&nbsp; Your objective is to identify “best of breed”
    companies for each key metric.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Determine data collection method</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The next step is to determine the data collection method and collect the data.&nbsp; For Financial Benchmarks the task
    typically involves identifying and organizing information available from financial filings and trade associations for
    each metric.&nbsp; Sometimes, for multi-business enterprises that are not competitors, it is possible to arrange
    financial data sharing at the business unit level. [This is one way to get around the distortion that occurs when the
    results of two or more distinct businesses are combined for corporate reporting purposes.]&nbsp; To accomplish this,
    the team should work with client personnel involved in process and performance benchmarking work. Frequently, clients
    that have been involved in previous performance benchmarking have established reciprocal data sharing agreements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Determine current performance gaps</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once the data is collected, determine the current performance gaps. This involves plugging the ten years of quarterly
    data (or whatever period you have access to), into a spreadsheet model that permits you to graphically display it. This
    combines data for each financial metric (identified in step one) and collected (in step three), from each company
    (identified in step two) into a single model.&nbsp; For the current period’s data, ask yourself: How does the client
    compare with each competitor and/or industry norms on each financial metric? How large is the gaps between the client
    and “best of breed?” Is this gap significant?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the implications? What might account for this
    difference/gap? Can you formulate a value hypothesis that, if proven, would or resolve explain the gap and reveal ways
    to close[or widen] it?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Project future performance levels</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is typically even more revealing to go beyond the present and project and assess likely future situations and
    explain past relationships.&nbsp; By analyzing trends in historical data across various companies, you can project
    future performance levels and identify specific problems and opportunities. To do this, look for five characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Clear trends [Can you explain the trend?&nbsp; If it’s improving, is everything appropriate being done to reinforce
        it?&nbsp; If it’s deteriorating, is everything appropriate being done to reverse it? Can you formulate a useful
        “Value Hypothesis” based on your answers to these questions?],
    </li>
    <li>
        Acceleration/deceleration in trends [Can you explain the acceleration or deceleration?&nbsp; If it’s improving, is
        everything appropriate being done to reinforce it?&nbsp; If it’s deteriorating, is everything appropriate being
        done to reverse it? Can you formulate a useful “Value Hypothesis” based on your answers to these questions?],
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes in direction of trends [Can you explain the change?&nbsp; If it’s improving, is everything appropriate
        being done to reinforce it?&nbsp; If it’s deteriorating, is everything appropriate being done to reverse it? Can
        you formulate a useful “Value Hypothesis” based on your answers to these questions?],
    </li>
    <li>
        Correlation [negative or positive] between two or more variables or trends [Can you explain the correlation?&nbsp;
        If it’s desirable, is everything appropriate being done to reinforce it?&nbsp; If it’s undesirable, is everything
        appropriate being done to reverse it? Can you formulate a useful "Value Hypothesis" based on your answers to these
        questions?]&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Extrapolation [If we extend the historical trends into the future, what happens to the client’s performance
        relative to peers and industry norms?&nbsp; Given the underlying “drivers” of the observed trends are they likely
        to continue as is, accelerate, or decelerate over the next few years? What, if anything, is being done by the
        client to enhance or diminish the trend?&nbsp; Can you formulate a "value Hypothesis" that, if proven, will enable
        the client to impact or exploit the trend in a favorable manner?]&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Communicate benchmarking findings and gain acceptance</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The final step is to communicate benchmarking findings and gain acceptance. The answers to questions raised in the
    foregoing Financial Benchmarks action steps are typically presented to client management in the Proposal or at the
    first progress review meeting.&nbsp; The team typically presents Competitive Mapping and analysis of Comparative
    Financial and Economic Structures findings [discussed below] in these early meetings, as well.&nbsp; Later sessions in
    which conclusions about "value hypotheses" are presented will use this material as a "baseline".
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Competitive Mapping - Competitive Mapping is a way of presenting and analyzing several (typically two or three)
        financial benchmarks simultaneously, so as to graphically demonstrate clear and meaningful relationships among
        variables.&nbsp; A typical Financial Benchmarks competitive map of ad agencies might plot average longevity of
        client relationships on the horizontal axis and EBIT/sales on the vertical axis, and represent the average tenure
        of client staff by the area of disks labeled with the names of the benchmarked agencies. This powerful exhibit
        (that actually appeared in the book The Loyalty Effect by Frederick Reichheld, a Bain & Company partner)
        clearly shows the largest disks in the upper right-hand corner. This competitive map naturally leads to two value
        hypotheses that say, "if we can develop a way to retain client staff longer, we can retain customers longer" and
        "if we can retain customers longer we can increase return on sales". These financial benchmarks direct us to focus
        on the "employee retention" and "customer retention" processes. -- Without this competitive map, these important
        relationships would have been hidden.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comparative Financial and Economic Structures -- It is almost always useful to compare the client’s operational
        economics to that of its peers competitors. This is easily accomplished using a "ratio decomposition diagram" like
        the one shown in the exhibits, above. (Please refer the "Examples")
    </li>
    <li>
        Basic Micro-economic Analysis – An important task in creating the Financial Benchmarks work product is to use the
        benchmarks to help create a better understanding the underlying competitive economics of the business and how it
        might be changing. [This effort overlaps with the micro-economic analysis undertaken in creating the Financial
        Assessment work product.]&nbsp; Essentially, we’re talking about applying the financial benchmark trends and the
        detail supporting them, to build an understanding of the critical economic factors that determine success or
        failure in a specific business environment and the competitive behaviors/strategies favored by these economic
        factors. Quantitatively, we mean factors like industry maturity/barriers to entry, industry concentration, and cost
        economics; e.g., scale, scope, and experience.&nbsp; [This typically requires you to collect information about
        industry structure/norms that will also be used in the creating the Financial Benchmarks work product.]&nbsp; Let’s
        briefly discuss 5 basic analyses that you will appreciate better after reading the strategy books in the References
        section:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Industry maturity/Barriers to Entry: Are new firms still entering the industry?&nbsp; Are these new firms
                making money?
            </li>
            <li>
                Industry concentration: How many direct competitors are there? Starting with the largest, how many firms
                cumulatively account for half of the industry’s sales?&nbsp; Is the number of competitors increasing or
                decreasing?&nbsp; Is the client one of the largest or one of the smallest competitors?
            </li>
            <li>
                Economies of Scale: What are the relative market shares of competitors?&nbsp; What are their relative gross
                margins? What are their relative product selling prices?&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Economies of Scope: What is the relative breadth of each competitor’s set of offering and market segments
                served? What are their relative gross margins? What are their relative product selling prices?
            </li>
            <li>
                Experience Curve Economics: What is the cumulative volume of products or services sold by each competitor,
                based on a common set of competencies? What are their relative gross margins? What are their relative
                product selling prices?<br />
            </li>
