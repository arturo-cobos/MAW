<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The development approach required to create this work product will depend on the scope of the problem and solution being
considered. A complex decision with widespread ramifications or a long-lasting impact will often require a more involved
selection process, both because of the complexity of the decision and the need to ensure that all the stakeholders buy into
and accept the decision. A simpler decision, one with fewer options or less far-reaching consequences may not require the
same degree of analysis to support and justify the decision. Nevertheless, in both situations the process will typically
involve many of the following activities: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Develop and describe the potential solution path alternatives. Theses may be unique to the client, or they may
            be generic approaches such as those defined by the Systems Management Solution Life Cycle. The description must
            include all the various solution elements that are deemed necessary to make this solution path complete for the
            client.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify the decision-makers and stakeholders. Understand and analyze their preferences and pre-dispositions
            towards certain solution paths or approaches.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Define and agree the decision-making process and associated evaluation criteria and weightings.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Conduct additional decision support studies as appropriate to gather the detailed information deemed necessary
            to inform the decision-making process. This will often include analysis of industry trends and the use of
            different solution paths in addressing similar problems. It may also include preparation of cost/benefit
            analyses, to at least sufficient detail to allow the respective alternatives to be compared and evaluated.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Analyze the client’s history and past performance with each of alternative solution approaches. If the client
            has a track record of success or failure with a particular approach then this should be factored in to the
            solution path evaluation process and the subsequent development of the transition initiatives.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            In many situations it will also be advisable to prepare a Change Readiness Assessment. This provides input to
            the evaluation process by determining the client’s readiness to make the required changes and their capacity to
            make the transformations demanded by each of the solution path alternatives.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Evaluate each solution path alternative against the agreed criteria and weightings, giving appropriate
            consideration also to the other inputs such as the client pre-disposition, the Change Readiness Assessment and
            the decision support studies.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Document the rationale for the recommendation and details supporting rejection of the other options.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><br />
<p>
    On a typical engagement many of these activities will be conducted in workshop with the client team.
