    <strong>Management Model</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    1. Using information learned during the assessment workshops and client interviews, document the current IT
    organization structure, the distribution of IT management responsibilities and the current management tool
    structure.<br />
    2. Review existing management philosophies or principles. Review existing management philosophies (or guiding
    principles) with regard to organizational, geographical, and technical aspects. Note: many organizations will not have
    existing documented guiding principles but do have a unique management philosophy.<br />
    3. Evaluate potential IT management models. After gathering the information necessary for the decision process and
    analyzing the <b>existing</b> management philosophy, a future management model should be selected. Consider all
    necessary geographical and organizational aspects, and reflect this consideration in the management model topology.
    When a single systems management model will not address the needs of a design, a "hybrid" model may be necessary. This
    may require an iteration of steps 2 and 3.<br />
    4. Document selection of the management model.<br />
    5. Gain sponsor approval. The client sponsor must sign off the selected IT management model as it has potentially
    far-reaching consequences for any subsequent organizational design or management technology architectures.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Distribution of Management Responsibilities</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    1. Agree on the process or service framework to be used for describing responsibilities. Preferably this should be
    based on work performed earlier in the engagement. Ensure that the level of granularity is appropriate to this
    engagement and will provide the required insight into any broad groupings of responsibility or shifts in
    responsibility. Excessive or unnecessary detail should be avoided if possible.<br />
    2. Identify the broad organisational groupings to which responsibility will be assigned (e.g. Corporate IT, Business
    Unit, Cross-Business Unit Council, External Partner, etc). At this stage the groupings should probably not be mapped to
    actual organisational entities since we are trying to establish a high level governance framework which should have
    greater longevity than any specific organisation structure.<br />
    3. Assign management responsibilities in accordance with the agreed management model and any relevant guiding
    principles. In completing the Management Responsibilities Matrix, think both about where the management responsibility
    and the management authority reside. Where responsibility is shared between more than one group denote this by checking
    both cells in the matrix and indicating whether there is a primary/secondary or a control/execution relationship.<br />
    4. Identify any broad groupings or domains of responsibility within the matrix and crosscheck that these are consistent
    with the management model and the guiding principles.<br />
    5. Identify and highlight any significant shifts in responsibility between the "as is" and "to be" environments. These
    gaps will require subsequent projects or initiatives defined to effect those shifts in responsibility.<br />
    6. Review the resulting Management Responsibility Matrix with the client sponsor and ensure you have concurrence before
    proceeding.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Management Controls</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    1. Determine whether the client already has a quality management program. This, or other mechanisms for ensuring
    continuous improvement, can provide a useful starting point for defining the management controls that are required and
    implementing them.<br />
    2. In the absence of any existing processes, identify any required overall governance processes and define the overall
    ownership and responsibility for implementing them.<br />
    3. Identify the control metrics and performance indicators that will allow the IT management system and processes to be
    monitored and improved.<br />
    4. If necessary, establish new policies on the types of management controls that are required and when or where they
    are to be implemented. This may include establishing broad guidelines on the triggers or levels of risk beyond which
    management controls become necessary. It may also include defining the checkpoints where management controls will be
    implemented.<br />
    5. Identify the compliance processes, incentives or communication plans necessary to ensure compliance with the IT
    management model and guiding principles. These will often be similar to the management processes and reviews put in
    place to ensure compliance with an enterprise IT architecture. (Examples of architecture management processes can be
    found within the <i>Enterprise Architecture</i> method or the associated <i>IT Architecture and Design</i> data base on
    ICM AssetWeb.)<br />
