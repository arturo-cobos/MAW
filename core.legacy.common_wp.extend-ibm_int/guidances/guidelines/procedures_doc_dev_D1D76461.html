    <strong>Procedures for an existing process</strong>
</p>
<p>
    These are best developed by the procedure author conducting workshops and interviews with the Business Process Owner,
    subject matter experts – and the people who actually perform:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The worksteps as part of their regular job. The purpose of the exercise is to document what they actually do, and
        the information can be gathered by asking a:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Series of questions; What do you do? How do you do it? What systems, applications, and reference documents
                do you use? How do you verify your work?&nbsp; The template in the Notation Section may be used to capture
                this information.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These procedures are typically developed when improvements are being made to an existing process where the operational
    level procedures are not well understood or documented.&nbsp; The level of detail documented for an existing process is
    determined by the need to sufficiently understand the process.
</p>
<p>
    Documentation for processes that will be replaced need to capture the key business activities.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Documentation for processes that are to be improved needs to be completed to a level that identifies all the worksteps
    required and unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Procedures for a newly designed process</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Unlike current process definition, new processes are developed iteratively.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        First the activity level flow needs to be defined and agreed to at a general level.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Then a template can be created for each Activity.&nbsp; The name and description should be entered first.
        Spreadsheets with a tab for each Activity provide a means of keeping all of the activities for a given process
        organized during the design process.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Workstep column can be completed with the most important worksteps in each activity.&nbsp; This is a good stage
        in the documentation process to have a process walkthrough to gain understanding and consensus.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Workstep column can then be completed in more detail to capture all the necessary worksteps and any decision
        logic if necessary.&nbsp; Technology worksteps can also be indicated at this time in the IT reference column.
    </li>
    <li>
        At this point the application configurators or developers are critical to the development of the
        documentation.&nbsp; All IT references need to be completed.&nbsp; These references can take the form of an
        Application Transaction type, a Screen name or number, a reference to standalone Database or the name of a
        spreadsheet or document to use.&nbsp; This is another good point to have another process walkthrough especially if
        actual or prototype IT references are available.
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally the inputs/sources and outputs/destinations are finalized to aid the performer during training and actual
        performance of the activity.
    </li>
    <li>
        This documentation is continually modified along with the IT support functions until the development is complete
        and the process is ready for training and production.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Drafts need to be reviewed by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        user representatives (using walk-through and simulations where possible)
    </li>
    <li>
        development and training teams
    </li>
    <li>
        Senior management.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The process owner must approve the completed procedure description.&nbsp;Once approved, copies can be made and
    distributed. Industry best practices can be used as input to design the procedures in the most effective manner.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note: What level of detail is necessary?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For existing processes the level of detail should allow those that don’t perform the process to understand the
    processes and be able to identify good and bad points in the process.
</p>
<p>
    For new processes the question is more difficult to answer.&nbsp;Ultimately the documentation has to describe how the
    work has to be done.&nbsp;The level of detail in the Activity templates depends on other supporting information
    available.&nbsp; For example, Do you describe all the steps in logging on to a system or is one workstep “Log on to the
    system” sufficient?&nbsp; If this is a new system and there is no other documentation, then the all of the details are
    probably necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is an existing system or there is other basic training available and the
    performer is expected to know how to log on to a system then a single workstep is sufficient.&nbsp; There is one
    guiding question, Can the performer perform the work once they have attended the training and have their process
    documentation?<br />
