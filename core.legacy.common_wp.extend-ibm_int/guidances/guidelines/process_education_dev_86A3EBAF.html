    The development of this work product begins upon completion of Implementation Strategy Planning, including information
    from people, process and technology.&nbsp; Education is performed for each education support process defined in the
    strategy for a particular stakeholder group.
</p>
<p>
    Education activities and their sequence are specifically suited to organizational change in the context of business
    change. It is not intended for ongoing organizational development that is independent of business change. The scope of
    this effort varies depending on the targeted stakeholdersâ€™ capacity for change, the number of required competencies,
    the underlying skills, knowledge, and behaviors, and the desired levels of expertise.
</p>
<p>
    The approach to developing Business Process Education views each role as the sum of its underlying competencies and
    each competency as the sum of its underlying skills, knowledge, and behaviors. You defined initial roles and skills in
    conjunction with high-level process design.
</p>
<p>
    This education plan now translates the underlying skills, knowledge, and behaviors into educational topics. The
    relationships between role, competency, and educational topic are applied to determine how the project team should be
    educated on the business process, potential enablers and the actual applications to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
    The following overview is an approach to meeting the learning requirements for a successful implementation around each
    education support process:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Identify Course(s)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Determine the roles addressed by the education support process.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Select from defined competencies related to these roles and falling within the scope of the support
                process.
            </li>
            <li>
                Define a high-level curriculum containing one course for each competency you select.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design structure and content for each course. Define at least one course module for each educational topic
                related to the competency the course addresses.
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine the most appropriate organization for the modules within the course.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Select Mechanisms for Delivery</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Choose from numerous delivery mechanisms the best combination for educating targeted stakeholders. Assign at least
        one mechanism to each module.&nbsp; This can be vendor training courses, hands on training, on-line training such
        as computer based training (CBTs), or case study type education, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Produce Course(s)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Develop the training, documentation, and help materials for each course, including related support materials such
        as delivery instructions and cover letters.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Produce Final Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Compile an overview of all courses related to the support process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This training should ideally take place as a part of the future modeling of the package and the business processes, but
    before the detailed documentation of the package specifications and the process workflow.&nbsp; This is in order to
    provide team members with sufficient knowledge about the standard system functionality and organization for them to
    make informed decisions about the possibilities and limitations of the proposed new business processes.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a list of steps that should be conducted to complete this work product:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Define the content of goal-oriented courses in accordance with the project scope and the required process
        capabilities and performance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gather information generated by the previous phases, confirm the completeness and correctness of this information
        and ensure that all project team members understand the information collected.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the requirements for project team members to participate in public available standard courses.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is often a necessity for specialized training for a small number of team members, in topics such as
        application development tools, configuration tools, API's and other technical subjects.&nbsp; If there are only a
        few attendees, it is normally more cost effective to attend public available standard courses, providing this fits
        with the project time schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
        Together with project management (IBM and the client), identify a case study, and prepare the management education.
        This is typically a 4 - 8 hour high-level session, focusing on business issues and benefits.
    </li>
    <li>
        There should be simple examples, which must be demonstrated on the system to give Management a feel for how the
        system works.&nbsp; If possible, a small hands-on exercise for management should be prepared.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the participants for each education and training course.&nbsp; It should be fairly straightforward to
        identify which project team members need to be trained.&nbsp; The project team members can help to define which
        members of senior management should also attend the courses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Allocate classrooms, work stations (terminals), etc., for use during the courses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Agree the education and training plan with participants.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include the education and training plan in the project plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Carry out education and training.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the results of education and training, and plan additional courses where needed.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Capture Results</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This effort produces these major results:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Training Kits. These include all of the training materials needed to transfer role-related competencies to targeted
        stakeholders. One Training Kit is produced per course. Packaging materials, delivery instructions, and cover
        letters are included when applicable.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Process Documentation. This includes all of the documentation materials needed to transfer role-related
        competencies to targeted stakeholders. Process Documentation is produced on a course-by-course basis, but may be
        gathered into a single manual (paper or electronic) for the particular role.
    </li>
    <li>
        Help Materials. This includes all of the help materials needed to transfer role-related competencies to targeted
        stakeholders. Help materials are produced on a course-by-course basis. They include such things as:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                On-line help screens
            </li>
            <li>
                Quick-reference cards
            </li>
            <li>
                Lessons learned workshops
            </li>
            <li>
                On-the-job assignments
            </li>
            <li>
                Facilitators, mentors, and coaches
            </li>
            <li>
                Telephone help lines
            </li>
            <li>
                Electronic information exchanges.<br />
            </li>
