    1 Plan the Causal Chain Development Process
</h3>
<p>
    1. The first step in developing the Causal Chain to identify purpose and focus of the Causal Chain. Causal Chains are
    typically used to derive the highest impact learning interventions from desired business results. However, there are
    numerous other potential purposes, including using Causal Chain to identify business measurements and as part of a
    strategic planning activity. Causal Chains should only be used for potentially high-leverage interventions, not for
    isolated or routine courses.<br />
    2. Next determine who will be involved in developing the Causal Chain. Internal team members and other organizational
    subject matter experts can provide valuable input concerning organizational causes and effects at various stages of
    Causal Chain development. A Causal Chain cannot be successfully developed without the availability of appropriate
    subject matter experts. It is often opportune to involve a key executive in identifying the desired business results,
    although this can be done through the use of documentation as well.<br />
    3. Identify strategic background information to be used in developing the Causal Chain. This could include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Vision Statement
    </li>
    <li>
        Mission Statement
    </li>
    <li>
        Goals
    </li>
    <li>
        Value Propositions
    </li>
    <li>
        Key Business Drivers&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Critical Success Factors&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Key Performance Indicators&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizational Performance Measures
    </li>
    <li>
        Critical Competencies and Capabilities
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    4. Determine the starting point of the Causal Chain. Causal Chain development can begin anywhere on the Causal Chain
    Template. However, the most likely starting points are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Desired business results
    </li>
    <li>
        An actual or proposed learning program or course
    </li>
    <li>
        Multiple interventions, such as a learning portfolio or curriculum<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    2 Create the Draft Causal Chain
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Working downward from the business results, or working upward from a current or proposed intervention (skills
            and knowledge), create a preliminary “chain of impact” from the training initiative to business results.<br />
            Starting at the top of the Causal Chain Template, Identify desired business results.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Begin with profit, revenue, and expenses. Identify other financial and non-financial business results tightly
            aligned with business priorities. While profit, revenue, and expense should probably be included at the top of
            every Causal Chain, customizing the business results provides an excellent opportunity of tailoring it to the
            particular customer organization.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify potential organizational performance (operational) indicators that are closely related to the desired
            business results. These are the performance indicators that most directly drive the business results. Both
            tangible and intangible indicators should be identified.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify individual/team performance factors that are closely related to the organizational performance
            indicators. These are the indicators of effective individual and team performance that, in turn, drive the
            organizational performance indicators.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify behaviors that are closely related to the individual/team performance factors. These are the new and
            different behaviors (not the behaviors that employees routinely exhibit) that will impact the individual/team
            performance indicators.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify skills/knowledge that are closely related to the critical behaviors.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Sequence the Causal Chain factors in terms of cause and effect. This can be done while the performance
            indicators are being generated, or once they have all been generated.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Continuing developing the Causal Chain until all tiers of the Causal Chain Template are appropriately
            populated.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Remove any indicators or behavior that do not appear to have a clear linkage with an item at the next higher
            level.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    3 Verify the Causal Chain
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Review the draft Causal Chain with subject matter experts, executives, and measurement people within the
            organization or business unit.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Obtain feedback from key stakeholders. There should be an iterative feedback process to ensure that the
            business logic is “credible.”
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Make revisions to the Causal Chain, if appropriate.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Continue the verification process until stakeholders are satisfied with the causal and business logic. However,
            remind those who are providing input that a Causal Chain represents a set of hypotheses, and does not have to
            be perfect.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    4 Identify the Key Leverage Points
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify the critical few indicators and behaviors on the Causal Chain that are considered the most important
            for driving the desired business results. These are referred to as the Key Leverage Points. The Key Leverage
            Points can be highlighted on the Causal Chain diagram.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Test the hypothesized Key Leverage Points by asking the question: If the value of these indicators were
            changed/improved, would it have a significant positive impact on desired business results? There can be
            multiple key leverage points, but remember that if everything is important, then nothing is important. Bottom
            line, one should not invest in learning interventions unless the Key Leverage Points will be impacted. In the
            XYZ Company project management example, all the skills and behaviors are high leverage, and highlighting the
            Key Leverage Points is probably not necessary.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    5 Identify the Critical Path (optional)
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Once the Key Leverage Points have been traced, one or more Critical Paths can be traced from the
            skills/knowledge to the critical behaviors, and up the Causal Chain to business results through the Key
            Leverage Points. This is called the Critical Path. There can be one or more Critical Paths in a Causal Chain.
            The Critical Path(s) can be highlighted on the Causal Chain diagram.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The Critical Path, although optional, can help in identifying the Critical Success Factors (see below). It can
            also help simplify the Causal Chain for presentation to stakeholders. In fact, the Critical Path(s) can be
            isolated from the rest of the diagram and presented to the key stakeholders and other executives to focus their
            attention on only the most important relationships. This is particularly important when the Causal Chain
            becomes very complex. In the XYZ Company project management example this is not the case, and tracing the
            Critical Path is probably not necessary.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    6 Identify Critical Success Factors
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            Determine the factors that might enable and inhibit the chain of causality depicted in the Causal Chain.
            Performance enablers and inhibitors affect the conversion of behavior into performance. Learning enablers and
            inhibitors affect the learning of skills/knowledge and their conversion into behavior. Other enablers and
            inhibitors can affect other causes and effects throughout the Causal Chain.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Derive Critical Success Factors from those enablers and inhibitors. The Critical Success Factors are usually
            factors that will most have the greatest impact on the Key Leverage Points. If there are too many inhibitors
            that cannot be adequately addressed, the probability of intervention success is low. These Critical Success
            Factors can become important inputs into the intervention design and implementation processes.
