    Since the Process/Function Attribute represents a fairly granular (yet somewhat abstract) summarization of a
    requirement, it is an analytical exercise to produce these requirements. The following are typical steps that might be
    taken to produce a set of Process/Function Attributes for each process / activity:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Elicitation:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Different types of project events might be scheduled in order to discuss the business processes that are to be
        supported by the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        These might be interviews, process identification and process definition, model development workshops, reviews of
        current application systems, or even the direct observation of the work being performed.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the Process/Function Attributes are identified they should be captured in any means possible, typically in a
        list form, and related to the process that it supports. At this point it is more important to capture any and all
        functionality "requirements" as they are identified and not be as concerned over the format until the subsequent
        step.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Structuring:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Once the overall process structure is defined in either a process hierarchy or process flow / map, the team reviews
        the documented list of the process activities and supporting details and begins identifying and describing the
        functional requirements of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The functional requirements are reviewed within the process that they support to further elaborate and define the
        requirement details needed to support the business processes. These details describe the function attributes of the
        system as defined by the process. The function attributes are documented with their associated process activities
        in a Process/Function Attribute matrix as notated above.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, more Process/Function Attributes are identified and defined through this analysis and discussion of
        the activity level detail. It is not uncommon for a single requirement statement to spawn several Process/Function
        Attributes when analyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a process model was not developed or does not exist, the Process/Function Attributes may be useful to
        iteratively drive out such a process model, using a "bottom-up" approach, although this approach is not preferred
        or recommended.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        <strong>Normalization:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p dir="ltr">
        In those situations where the Process/Function Attributes where not defined within the context of a structured
        process model, some level of duplication of the requirements may occur. This will become obvious as all of the
        Process/Function Attributes are reviewed and structured into a Process/Function Attribute matrix.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
        During this review, the content of the duplicate function attributes should be consolidated into one, since they
        may prove confusing in later project steps. Also, there will be a second opportunity for abstraction at this point;
        Process/Function Attributes can be merged if they are similar enough and any differences can be documented in the
        description.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li dir="ltr">
        <strong>Configuration:</strong><br />
        In order to test the reasonableness of the final set of Process/Function Attributes, it is useful to trace a set of
        business transactions (such as actual customer orders) through the process model, and see if all necessary
        Process/Function Attributes can be accounted for. Modify or add to the model as necessary.<br />
