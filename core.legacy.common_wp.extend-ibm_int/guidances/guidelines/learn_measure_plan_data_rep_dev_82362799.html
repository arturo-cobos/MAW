            Create the Measurement Menu. The Measurement Menu should be derived from a Causal Chain or other measurement
            inventory. It is recommended that measures be selected from the Business Results, Organizational Performance
            Indicators, and Individual/Team Performance Indicators from the Causal Chain. Select the indicators that appear
            to be good measures of the intervention. This selection is based on linkage with the Key Leverage Points on the
            Causal Chain
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Prioritize the proposed measures. Identify priority list of measures based on subject matter expert review in
            terms of business linkage and availability of data. Business measures should be rated in terms of the strength
            of the linkage of the measure with the intervention – Strong (S), Moderate (M), or Weak (W) and the ability to
            measure (accessibility or availability of the data for the proposed measure) – High (H), Moderate (M), Low (L).
            Once the strength of the links and the ability to measure are rated, it is up to the consultant and the subject
            matter experts to determine the highest priority measures for inclusion on the Learning Measurement Plan and
            Data Repository. However, it is recommend that only strong to moderate links be considered acceptance and
            ability to measure should also high or moderate.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify Other Potential Measures (optional). If needed, identify and inventory other measures that might be
            appropriate for learning measurement. This should be done if the Measurement Menu is not perceived to be
            comprehensive enough.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Produce the populated Learning Measurement Plan and Data Respository, including measures, but not data. This
            plan should include both Business and Learning Outcome Measures. The list of Business Measures should be based
            on the prioritization of the measures from the Measurement Menu. The Learning Outcomes Measures selection
            should be made based on the information needs of the client in terms of Levels 0-3 learning measurement.

        <div>
            Perform Predictive Measurement quantification and compute ROI (return on investment) or use some other
            valuation method, if appropriate. This task is optional. This should be done using the following procedure:
        </div>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Determine the appropriateness of quantifying the learning and business measures. The decision to do
                Predictive Measurement Quantification should be based on a number of considerations. The most important one
                is whether credible estimates of the measures can be achieved. If the estimates are not credible, any
                effort invested in this task will be wasted. Identify the most appropriate measures for quantification. The
                critical path measures will not all be readily quantifiable. Select the ones that lend themselves to
                quantitative estimation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Determine the estimating methodology and assumptions. Predictive estimates are developed using a
                    methodology with underlying assumptions. Measures typically need to be converted to dollar terms in
                    order to use valuation methods. One important cautionary note before you begin: Because quantitative
                    analysis is based on estimating assumptions, these assumptions must be credible.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Estimate the quantifiable factors. One or more experts are typically used for estimating the effects on
                    learning measures. The selection of the experts is critical to the credibility of the estimates.
                    Estimates can be weighted by asking estimators for their confidence levels (between 100% confidence and
                    0% confidence).
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Verify the credibility of the estimates with stakeholders (optional, but recommended). Once the
                    estimates have been made, estimates should be checked with the stakeholders to assess their
                    credibility.
                </div>

            <li>
                <div>
                    Apply appropriate valuation methodology to each intervention option. Use the valuation decision and
                    method(s) determined in the previous steps.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Determine the most appropriate measures to use as baseline (pre-intervention) measures.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify the <i>target</i> for each proposed baseline measure. The <i>target</i> is the goal level, or
            standard, for the measure, if has not already been determined earlier. The target provides a critical
            <i>reference point</i> for interpreting the data. This provides a basis for understanding measurements during
            other phases. Without a target, there would be no basis for interpreting the progress being made. Establishing
            evaluation objectives or targets has several advantages. It provides measurable goals for assessing the
            progress of all training. It focuses attention on accountability and communicates a strong message about the
            need for measurement and evaluation.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Collect the baseline data. Enter the data into the appropriate spreadsheet or database for later comparison
            with in-process and retrospective data. As part of this process the quality of the data needs to be evaluated.
            The measurement plan should be updated to take into account the number of in-process measurements to be taken.
            It is important to determine the method and schedule for ongoing data collection.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Collect in-process data according to the plan. Most of the data should be available through existing
            operational data collection methods. Make sure to assess the cost of continuing in-process data collection if
            there is no budget for incremental change or large-scale improvements to the intervention that are detected by
            the analysis of the in-process data.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Collect retrospective data, which typically occurs after the intervention is completed. Its primary purpose is
            to make <i>final judgments</i> about the intervention. ROI analysis can be done at this point, if the client
            desires.
