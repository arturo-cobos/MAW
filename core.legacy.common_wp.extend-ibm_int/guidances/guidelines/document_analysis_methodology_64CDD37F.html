    Definition
</h3>
<p>
    The word document generally conjures up visions of a stack of paper, bound or stapled together, intended for reading in
    a serial fashion, from front to back.
</p>
<p>
    Traditionally a document is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A mass-produced publication<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A collection of words and pictures<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Crafted by authors and illustrators.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    More recently a document has been:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A publication produced at department level, to be consumed in-house<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Standardized within the company or department<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Controlled by tradition or executive direction.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These documents were often produced in islands of automation, not generally distributed freely electronically.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Today a document is a structured presentation or view of information.&nbsp; It is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A collection of related information, generated and rendered as needed in whatever format is required<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Standardized by information type, audience, subject matter or other organizing principle&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Sometimes controlled at the source level by the tools used to create the material (using proprietary storage
        formats or access methods) although this is what the SGML/XML standards attempt to prevent.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Not all the information that is relevant to this new environment will be found in traditional ‘document’ formats like
    word processing formats or printed materials; one must also look in databases, spreadsheets and other information
    sources.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Business Purpose of Document Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    The business reasons for doing document analysis are to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understand the content and structure of existing information in terms that are specific to the client’s
        business.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate current practice or design new ways of structuring and representing the information to meet the needs of
        the business, now and in the future.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    More specifically, this analysis will show how to:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Facilitate standardization in tools, training, information structure and content, which can improve productivity
        and consistency<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Exploit new technologies by having well-defined, well-understood and consistent information bases which can be more
        easily adapted to exploitation of new technologies than information organized in an ad hoc fashion or information
        stored in proprietary formats<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Organize the information so that the information that already exists can be found and used quickly, easily and
        reliably&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Exploit new business opportunities by deriving new products from existing information assets&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Comply with industry standards to meet regulatory requirements or contractual requirements.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    The Scope of Document Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    The scope of document analysis goes beyond analysis of ‘documents’ and includes evaluating other sources of
    information.&nbsp; An essential part of this analysis also includes understanding the business and technical
    environment in which information is used.&nbsp; The information and an appropriate organization for the information is
    the key to having what is necessary to efficiently implement the functions of the system, including workflow,
    authoring, processing, query and retrieval, print and electronic delivery.&nbsp; This analysis will affect the design
    of components of the system outside of the information source formats (SGML, word processing, etc.).&nbsp; It will
    effect the attributes defined in the document management system and potentially database schemas as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    The Materials Needed
</h3>
<p>
    The materials typically used in a document analysis are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Overall system requirements, system functional specifications and workflow specifications (Use Case Model,
        Non-Functional Requirements, Usability Requirements)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        ER diagrams and other data schema descriptions (Logical Data Model)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Hardcopy and softcopy samples of documents and other information sources, training samples or source coding
        samples, presentation style and authoring guidelines, and industry standards (Document Inventory)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Methodology
</h3>
<p>
    The following is an overview of the methodology used to evaluate the materials described above.&nbsp;
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Find and collect the relevant materials (Collect Document Inventory)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Examine the source material, the system requirements and other specifications&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Find and define document classes and their boundaries, this may include inventing containers to associate
        information, like the term and definition in a definition list&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Build basic models of common structures in the data, these will probably be modified as the analysis
        proceeds&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Classify, group and define the relationships between document classes&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Learn, standardize and record the terminology as you perform the rest of these tasks.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    See the following diagram for a pictorial overview of the Document Analysis process.

</p>
<h4>
    Choosing Sample Document Sets
</h4>
<p>
    Get a sample of all document types, including all variations if possible.&nbsp; If necessary, get subsets of instances
    but care must be taken to get as diverse a sample as is representative of the corpus of documents being analyzed.
</p>
<p>
    Get samples from different sources or authors since different sources often use different conventions or procedures
    based on their history.
</p>
<p>
    Get samples of different ages since the usage of tools often changes as users come and go and the organization gets
    more familiar with the tools in use.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Where Does Information Come From?
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Evaluate data flows ‘outside-in’, or from the source to its use or uses.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When multiple sources for the same information exist, investigate and find “one true source”<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the impact of changes from source to previously imported information.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    How to Analyze Documents
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Choose sample document sets focusing on the domain of interest.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Decide what questions to ask based on business objectives.&nbsp; Use the business objectives, the system
        requirements and system functions to focus the analysis; if no function of the system requires that some document
        class be identified, there is little point in refining the definition of that document class.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluate the documents, tracking and combining results by document type:<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Characteristics or semantics<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Internal structure<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Context.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Build terminology and define structure for the document classes as described above.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Differentiate between true structural or semantic differences and pure presentation differences.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Document Evaluation Questions
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        What basic types of information do/should various types of publications contain?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What information is required by the processes and functions supported by the system?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What does the style of presentation or the organization of the information tell me about the purpose and value of
        the document object?&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Where are publications and/or information needed by processes and functions of the system inconsistent or redundant
        and why?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What external and internal standards apply?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        How do existing concepts of information and corresponding standards relate?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each document type:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Who is the audience for this document type?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the stated purpose of the document, if not stated, surmise what it is.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What average document size was observed?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the relative sizes of the major parts of the document?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the character of the graphic content: type of graphics (scanned image, vector), size of the graphics on the
        page, size of the graphics files, format of the graphics files<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What retrievability and navigation aids are present in the document?&nbsp; Table of contents, indices, etc.&nbsp;
        What retrievability and navigation aids should be present?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What other information is referenced?&nbsp; Links, bibliographic references, footnotes, etc.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For a specific document class:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is the semantic of the document class?&nbsp; What does it mean?&nbsp; What does it represent?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What system functions, workflow functions, use this class of information?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What structure is the class part of?&nbsp; In what contexts is it used?&nbsp; What internal structure comprises the
        class?&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the requirements or constraints on the document classes, for example a row cannot have more cells than
        there are columns defined for it?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the content of the document class, including additional document classes?&nbsp; For example, it may be
        useful to define subclasses for fielded information like dates, addresses and many other classes of
        information<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the relationships within this class or with other document classes: sequence, number of occurrences,
        references?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When going through this analysis, be sure to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Document samples of the valid instances of the document class<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create class and document structure models based on the collection of document class definitions just created.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Also note that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Document classes should make sense in the application domain<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Document classes will often correspond to nouns in requirements or functional descriptions
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Describing Structure
</h4>
<p>
    Remove inconsistency and redundancy that involves looking at all the defined document classes.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Differentiate objects which differ in structure, content or attributes<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Add non-presentation structure where useful such as grouping elements<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Change non-standard structure to conform to standard structures
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Keep business and technical goals in mind: system function support, reuse, interchange, storage, convertibility.
</p>
<h4>
    Object-Oriented Design and Document Analysis
</h4>
<p>
    In some ways, the process of identifying document classes and objects to be implemented in a software system can be
    very similar.&nbsp; Document classes are or contain data that is quantified into discrete, distinguishable
    entities.&nbsp; Objects that have the same internal data structure and have the same behaviors when processed are
    typically grouped into a class.&nbsp; Document classes may also share attributes and behaviors where ‘lower-level’ or
    subclasses have the characteristics of the ‘higher-level’ superclasses, adding a few of their own (called inheritance)
    or replacing them, called overloading.&nbsp; For document classes, like other object classes, it is possible to exploit
    this kind of sub-classing in the implementation system using common code to process sub-classed information objects.
</p>
<p>
    One point of confusion when dealing with document classes to be implemented using SGML/XML is that SGML, XML and other
    similar markup systems have the concept of an instance hierarchy which really represents the structure of the content
    of the higher level element.&nbsp; This is not the same inheritance in the object oriented design sense but it is
    possible for some SGML/XML designs to specify the inheritance of properties (often specified as attributes) down this
    instance hierarchy (font, point size, user level, operating system applicability) and even up that hierarchy (security
    classification).&nbsp; This may be viewed as an association in OO terms, however in SGML/XML it is a very special
    association because it is intrinsic to the markup system.&nbsp; It may be that in some cases, containment may be used
    to represent other types of associations that document analysis uncovers, but that is an implementation concern.&nbsp;
    Aggregation also represents this type of relationship.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    There are several themes from the object-oriented design arena that have an important place in document analysis.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Abstraction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An important part of any analysis, this is the act of focusing on the essential characteristics of a piece of
    information, ignoring those properties that are not a part of the object’s essence.&nbsp; A good test for this is
    comparing two object instances and determining if they are the same class, in spite of their differences.&nbsp; If they
    are, then the properties that do differ are not essential to the definition of that class.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Encapsulation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In document analysis, this means grouping information together at the appropriate level in the document’s
    structure.&nbsp; In SGML, this is typically done using a hierarchy of containing elements.&nbsp; In the programming
    domain, appropriate encapsulation prevents small local changes in a program from rippling across the entire program or
    system.&nbsp; In information design, appropriate encapsulation enables reuse since the information most likely to be
    reused as a unit is grouped together while unneeded information is not included.&nbsp; It also may mean that the
    information to be processed is available when needed, not found in another part of the document or database.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Emphasis on Object Structure, Not Presentation Structure</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As is found in object-oriented design, there is a pronounced emphasis on object structure, what an object is, rather
    than how it is used, its presentation or processing.&nbsp; It is common to use information’s presentation or processing
    as one defining characteristic of a given document object’s definition but not usually the defining
    characteristic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Synergy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Design is often a compromise but a good design finds ways to maximize the synergy of these factors while minimizing the
    mismatches.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, some aspects of object-oriented design are less useful in the document analysis.&nbsp; Combining
    data and behavior falls into this category.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    An excellent summary of how to identify and eliminate candidate objects and attributes can be found in Object-Oriented
    Modeling and Design by Rumbaugh, et al. in Chapter 8, Analysis.&nbsp; Generally, class inheritance is not part of the
    Document Analysis.
