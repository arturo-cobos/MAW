<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The development approach is very straightforward: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Define business roles:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Review any existing documentation on the operational / organizational structure of the enterprise. The
                current structure will usually reflect the priorities and importance of specific business activities and
                locations. An organization chart will usually be readily available. Check its currency and completeness.
                Identify the underlying generic structure to the chart, (e.g. Company / Divisions / Departments/etc. )
            </li>
            <li>
                For each organizational unit, determine the roles, responsibilities and activities that are performed by
                staff at the unit. Compare these across different units and rationalize to produce one set of roles for the
                enterprise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Concentrate on those roles that participate in the major, most critical activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider roles performed outside of the enterprise,( e.g. customer or suppliers.)
            </li>
            <li>
                For each role identified, document the name, a brief description and the major activities that are
                performed by the role. Represent the role/activity relationship on a matrix.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Define logical locations:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identify the logical business locations. These are essentially classifications of the physical, or
                geographic, locations and are characterized by such things as the activities they perform and the customers
                and products they service. A useful initial step is to identify the geographic locations where the business
                physically operates. This can be done fairly quickly and does not need to be 100% accurate or complete. So,
                for example, if a bank has 300 branches, it is not necessary to identify or document all of these. What is
                important is whether all these branches perform similar activities and service similar customers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Confirm that different locations with the same classification are indeed the same. For example, in a
                banking environment, many locations may be called "branches", however some may be full service branches
                whilst others are satellite branches performing either a subset of enterprise activities or a different set
                of activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                For each location, document its name, description, business activities it performs and any other
                information that is relevant to the engagement objectives, (e.g. how many employees ate each location,
                customer types served, products sold/serviced, geographic areas served, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                In large enterprises, typically many different logical business locations will be found at any one
                geographic location. To identify these, consider what business activities are performed and what
                organizational units are located at each geographic location.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Map each of the locations to the roles previously defined. Review these for completeness, (i.e. are all roles
        performed at least in one location; do all locations have roles).
    </li>
</ul>Having developed a draft set of roles and locations, review these with appropriate members of the client organization.</td>
