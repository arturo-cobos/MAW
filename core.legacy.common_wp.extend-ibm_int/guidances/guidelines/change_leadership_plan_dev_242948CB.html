<p>
    While both sets of skills are needed during periods of change and at other times, in this work product we look at how
    to build the capacity for leadership within client change projects. Strong change leaders:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Are harder to find than strong managers
    </li>
    <li>
        Are critical for project success&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Often face opposition to change
    </li>
    <li>
        Often require education, coaching, and other support to be successful&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    IBM’s Change Leadership Model lists eight action steps that describe the critical competencies of effective change
    leaders:<br />
    1. <b>Assess</b> - understand and manage the demands of change on the organization<br />
    2. <b>Clarify</b> - articulate the sense of urgency and understand the scope and requirements of change<br />
    3. <b>Announce</b> - orchestrate information flow, using a well-developed communication plan<br />
    4. <b>Diagnose</b> - assess barriers to change and form committed teams<br />
    5. <b>Plan</b> - develop an integrated implementation plan with clear roles, milestones, and other parameters<br />
    6. <b>Execute</b> - implement the plan, coach others, and hold participants accountable<br />
    7. <b>Monitor</b> - track progress, keep others informed, and make appropriate adjustments<br />
    8. <b>Evaluate</b> - ensure desired outcomes, harvest learnings, and sustain the change
</p>
<p>
    This model is used later in assessing and developing change leaders.
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>1.2</i></b> <b><i>Identify Change Leader Roles for this Project</i></b><br />
    In any change effort, different types of leaders exist. This work product helps to identify and assess all types of
    leaders, at several levels of the organization. The types of change leaders and their roles include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Sponsors</b> - one or more senior executives who “legitimize” the change. These individuals have the power,
        vision, sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo, and appreciation of the resources and commitment needed in
        order to lead the change. They can also authorize the resources needed to implement the change. The most senior
        executive in this role is sometimes called the initiating sponsor (IS).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sustaining sponsors</strong> - These individuals often report to the initiating sponsor either directly or
        indirectly. They have most of the same responsibilities as the IS, but usually are responsible for providing change
        leadership on a functional or geographical basis.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Advocates</strong> - These people want the change to happen, and may even have a lot at stake, but cannot
        direct it to happen, usually because of their position in the organization. Advocates are very important, because
        by definition they are in a position to influence others to support or not support the change. As an example, a CFO
        may be a very interested advocate for the implementation of better management information systems in manufacturing,
        because of potential financial savings or improved reporting.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Potential advocates</strong> - These individuals are in key positions (not directly involved in the change
        implementation) and could be powerful advocates for the change, but are not currently engaged. They represent an
        important opportunity to broaden support and influence by educating them on the organizational or localized
        benefits to be gained through their support.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Change agents</strong> - Agents provide services or leadership to implement the change, typically at the
        direction of the sponsor(s). Examples include team leaders, facilitators, and process owners. Note that everyone
        who provides an important service is not a change agent. Some, such as software designers, end user trainers, or HR
        specialists who revise job descriptions, are simply service providers.<br />
        The Role Map tool (ODR) is usually a valuable tool for identifying the various change leaders in a project.
        Important knowledge about change leadership is also often gained during change readiness assessment
        activities.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><i>1.3</i></b> <b><i>Organize Change Leaders and Project Team(s)</i></b><br />
    Creating understanding and commitment among the leaders of the change effort -- the project teams and individuals -- is
    critical to building change leadership. Fundamental to building change leadership is an emphasis on “user” or client
    involvement from the first day of the engagement, throughout the project life cycle where "users" take ownership. At
    the overall project team level, this usually involves four steps: developing or articulating a mission statement with
    project leaders or team members; establishing a structure for leadership; establishing a meeting schedule and other
    logistics; and planning subjects to be addressed by leadership.<br />
    An example of developing or articulating a mission statement with project leaders or project team is:
</p>
<p>
    <b>Company mission is: Become a world leader by advancing the success of our partners</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project 1. Objectives 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ability to manage our business more profitably&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhanced capabilities to better manage financial systems and processes across business units
            </li>
            <li>
                More current financial information on Company X’s activities through the reporting options and data
                analysis capabilities of the software&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Year 2000 compliance&nbsp;

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>

        Change leadership readiness factors&nbsp; 
        <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Top leadership commitment/sponsorship&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Understanding the psychology of change&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Organizational alignment (history, process, measures)&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Anticipation of internal/external events
            </li>
            <li>
                Appreciation of pace and degree of change&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To establish a structure for leadership (steering committee and project team(s), see the next section on how to
    identify and assess change leaders and advocates. Examples of such a structure are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Steering committee or leadership team: Project Office representing key knowledge areas: Business, IT, Software, or
        Transformation subject and implementation (HR, Implementation).
    </li>
    <li>
        Project team(s): "Best and brightest" from the company in technical, HR, and business disciplines and critical
        implementation topics: hardware and software testing if ERP training and process expertise<br />
        Establishing a meeting schedule and other logistics needs to be done because it is very hard to find a project
        whose leadership team meets or talks less than once a week and project teams are less than full time.<br />
        To plan the subjects to be covered by leadership, see the topics below in Section 3, "Educate Change Leaders”.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><i>1.4</i></b> <b><i>Develop a Change Leadership Plan</i></b><br />
    You should develop Change Leadership Plan, usually organized by phases of the project. Included in this plan should be
    the important roles to be played by the change leaders, the ensuing actions that are required, and certain other
    considerations that will ensure congruence and consistency. The change leadership plan provides a framework to help:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Develop and unify a common agenda across the organization
    </li>
    <li>
        Sustain rhetoric with change actions&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Put what already may be under way into context&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Refocus efforts to the best effect<br />

    <br />
    A change leadership development plan may also be developed (see Section 3 below). This is a plan for developing the
    capabilities that may be needed for the leaders to perform effectively.
</p>
<p>
    <i><b><i>1.5</i> Organize Change Leaders</b></i><br />
    Working with key client sponsor(s), develop and articulate a mission statement. Then establish a structure for
    leadership (steering committee, project team, etc.) and select representative membership to ensure project support and
    proper two-way information flow. Plan the frequency of meetings, and plan the subjects to be addressed by
    leadership.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>2</strong> <strong>Identify and Assess Change Leaders</strong><br />
    Change leaders are needed at all levels (Recall the principle of cascading sponsorship). It is not enough to have one
    “heroic” sponsor. Sustained change requires a network, or infrastructure, of leaders who can embrace a change and
    inspire others to do so. In section 1B above (the discussion of roles in change projects), we discussed sponsors,
    agents, targets, and advocates. Members of any of these groups can provide leadership to the change. In this work
    product we will address actions with regard to sponsors, advocates, and agents.<br />
    Identifying change leaders has six steps:<br />
    1. Select possible change leaders<br />
    2. Assess the perceived level of support for the change<br />
    3. Assess other considerations<br />
    4. Assess suitability of candidates<br />
    5. Select leaders for project roles<br />
    6. Identify and assess change advocates
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>2.1</i></b> <b><i>Change Leaders</i></b><br />
    The client sponsor needs to review the organization chart and recommend possible candidates to lead the change. Use the
    IBM Change Leadership Model to assess perceived strengths and weaknesses among the leadership group.<br />
    Although the organization chart often dictates the change leadership structure, assessing strengths, weaknesses
    (relative to this change), and perceived level of support is still important and useful.

    assessed as currently negative or neutral, you will need to develop strategies to gain their support. These strategies
    may include education, exposure to best-practice examples, and consequence management (application of incentives and
    accountability). This "assessment" is an informal characterization, provided by observing knowledgeable individuals
    such as the project sponsor or project team members. Be sensitive about "labeling" people as non-supportive; seek these
    judgments from client personnel as much as possible.<br />
    This exercise is useful because it may uncover some potentially difficult problems in the change process. Resourcing
    change projects with people from within the organization is often problematic; some department heads may not want to
    lose a talented individual from their group. Therefore the commitment of the sponsor to the change process will be
    tested by the priority that is given to the change leaders’ activities.
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>2.3</i></b> <b><i>Assess Other Considerations</i></b><br />
    Review each individual’s situation with the client sponsor. When you assess the current workload of each potential
    change leader, you may uncover some problems about using the candidates as change leaders. They may not have time to
    undergo training and take on additional responsibilities. Other considerations, such as impending personal time off,
    may affect a candidate’s suitability.
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>2.4</i></b> <b><i>Assess Suitability of Candidates</i></b><br />
    Using the results of data gathered in 2B and 2C, assess each potential leader’s suitability to play a key role. This
    will be a tradeoff between the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Their skills, experience, and knowledge of their area
    </li>
    <li>
        Their leadership characteristics
    </li>
    <li>
        Their availability to do the work
    </li>
    <li>
        Any other work considerations&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You need to coach the sponsor in making hard choices about putting people in key positions to lead the change. This is
    a critical activity, so the risks of not using the best people need to be stressed.<br />
    The number of change leaders required will depend on the size of the organization and the impact of the change.
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>2.5</i></b> <b><i>Select Leaders for Project Roles</i></b><br />
    Based on the assessment above, assist the sponsor as appropriate in selecting leaders for key roles in the project.
    Some roles will dictated by the position held on the organization chart, while others (e.g., team leaders) may be
    discretionary. In either case, use the assessment data captured to build leadership education and development plans as
    directed later in this work product.
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>2.6</i></b> <b><i>Identify and Assess Change Advocates</i></b><br />
    Change advocates are key individuals who support or are affected by the change, but do not have the authority to direct
    the change to happen. Because they can play a critical role in influencing others, potential advocates should be
    identified, their current level of perceived support assessed, and strategies developed to gain their support where
    necessary. Follow these basic steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify potential change advocates using a Role Map or the Stakeholder Plan, if available.
    </li>
    <li>
        As with the potential sponsors, assess the perceived level of support for this change.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Perceived level of support should be noted as positive (+), neutral (0), or negative (-). Be cautious about
        "labeling" individuals; facilitate getting clients to make those characterizations.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Where parties are assessed as currently negative or neutral, develop strategies to gain their support. In this
        case, these strategies may include education, exposure to best practice examples, invitations to progress meetings
        or other informative events, and written updates to ensure that advocates are properly informed. In some cases,
        project team members may be assigned to each advocate with specific tasks or messages to convey. At the same time,
        make plans to actively nurture and maintain the support of "positive" advocates -- even the most beautiful flower
        will wilt if not watered.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Revisit this "advocate map" from time to time to validate and update your identification, assessment, and strategies
    for nurturing Change Advocates.

    <strong>3</strong> <strong>Educate Change Leaders</strong><br />
    Educating change leaders has four steps:
</p>
<p>
    1. Define what change leaders do<br />
    2. Create a group needs assessment<br />
    3. Review and select opportunities for development<br />
    4. Recommend action(s) and plan execution (within budget and scope)
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>3.1</i></b> <b><i>Define What Change Leaders Do</i></b><br />
    Change leaders align people both inside and outside the organization to be receptive to the change. The IBM Change
    Leadership Model describes the eight key elements of effective change leadership:<br />

    effort should be a set of identified individual and group development needs.<br />
    It is important to remember that training is not always the preferred or correct solution to sponsorship issues. Often
    at this stage change leaders are not able to perform these actions because of a lack of:

    <strong>4</strong> <strong>Provide Coaching to Support Change Leaders</strong><br />
    The coaching skill is a critical consultant competency, regardless of the relationship with the change leader. Possible
    relationships include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Advisory</b>. The change leader could use a consultant when he/she has a specific query about carrying out a
        leadership action
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Partnership</strong>. The consultant and the change leader could work together for a specified time. The
        change leader should perform the actual communication and other leadership activities, but the consultant could be
        involved to help in the preparation and to provide advice.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mentoring</strong>. The change leader could arrange regular meetings with the consultant to review actions
        and plan for future ones.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The type of relationship depends on the individuals concerned, the way they like to work, and the complexity of their
    leadership role. It is important to plan how this relationship should work and review its success or otherwise at
    regular intervals.<br />
    The IBM standard for coaching is the GROW model, which is taught in XPC/PCW training. The GROW model is a four-step
    approach to coaching individuals to determine a course of action:
</p>
<p>
    1. <b>G</b>oal - Setting objectives for the coaching session<br />
    2. <b>R</b>eality - Understanding the current situation, including what has been tried so far<br />
    3. <b>O</b>ptions - Exploring alternatives for resolving the dilemma and moving toward a desired goal<br />
    4. <b>W</b>ay Forward - Examining potential obstacles and agreeing on an action plan
</p>
<p>
    You need to obtain agreement from the client on whether coaching is desired, what type of relationship will best fit
    the situation, and what personalities are involved. In other words, don’t assume a coaching role. The input will be
    better received if there is a "personal contract" to give and receive this type of help.

<p>
    <strong>5</strong> <strong>Implement Change Leadership Measurement and Feedback</strong><br />
    At key milestones in the project, a team of representatives from the business should provide feedback on the success or
    otherwise of each leadership action:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Include representation from a range of organizational levels if appropriate
    </li>
    <li>
        Represent the core implementation team, the key stakeholders, and line management
    </li>
    <li>
        Include the leader of the change program&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Implementing measurement and feedback has three steps:
</p>
<p>
    1. Plan the feedback sessions<br />
    2. Conduct the feedback sessions<br />
    3. Identify an action plan based on the activity
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>5.1</i></b> <b><i>Plan the Feedback Sessions</i></b><br />
    Keep the workshop manageable. If there are more than six people, design a program that uses syndicate work for much of
    the diagnostic. Spread the session(s) over several days if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    <b><i>5.2</i></b> <b><i>Conduct the Feedback Sessions</i></b><br />
    Ask each participant to answer the following questions about each leadership action:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What can you say about the impact of the activity to date?
    </li>
    <li>
        What do you see are the achievements, areas of concern, and blockages?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        To what extent do you feel the action is producing the planned outcomes?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are there any additional indicators of success?
    </li>
    <li>
        What adjustments, if any, need to be made? (Start, stop, continue)&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Change leaders may not be performing their tasks adequately and alternatives may need to be found. If individuals are
