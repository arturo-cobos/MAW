    Cognitive Walkthrough
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Plan in advance how data will be collected so data can easily be summarized. For example, during a cognitive
        walkthrough, use usability logging tools that will summarize data quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify 5 to 12 evaluation participants who match the profile of eventual users of the planned system. Obtain
            their commitment for participation by contacting their managers and arranging a time when the users might be
            available to participate in the evaluation.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify use cases that can serve as the basis for usability and accessibility evaluation scenarios. Select use
            cases that account for a high percentage of system usage or represent low frequency but high importance tasks.
            From these use cases, build usability and accessibility test cases that provide a start point, an end point,
            data inputs and expected outputs, and criteria for successful completion.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify dependencies of data or information that will be needed to write an early evaluation report. For
            example, plan which statistical analysis will be used to analyze the data.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Prepare an early evaluation report template before usability/accessibility evaluation has begun. Descriptions
            of participants, scenarios, the application under development, intended audience, and procedures all can be
            incorporated into this template.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Conduct the evaluation. There are three main activities that occur during an evaluation: introduction, method,
            and debriefing.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Introduction</b><br />
    During the introduction, the evaluation conductor explains the purpose of the evaluation to the participant. These are
    elements covered in an evaluation introduction:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Efforts are made to ensure the evaluation participant that the software is being evaluated, not the
            participant, and that the participant can withdraw from the evaluation at any time. The participant is also
            assured that individual participant performances will not be reported back to management.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Evaluation participants are encouraged to voice as many opinions as possible during the evaluation and are
            coached on how to use the “think-aloud” method. For example, the evaluation conductor may model the
            “think-aloud” method for setting the alarm on a digital watch to show them how the technique is done.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The participant is advised that the results of the evaluation will be used to improve the user interface and
            that they should not worry if they run into problems during the evaluation since it may be more of a reflection
            of the interface and not the user.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A reminder that the system is confidential and the evaluation should not be discussed with others. The
            evaluation participant is advised that the eventual system may not bear any resemblance to the user interface
            model exercised during the evaluation.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            An explanation of the use of any audio and video recording equipment should be provided.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Method</b><br />
    The questions are concerned with identifying users’ goals, the ease with which users can identify the consequence of
    their decisions, and users’ ability to state whether they believe they are making progress toward a goal. After taking
    part in the walkthrough, users answer these questions for each step and then rate the likelihood of whether
    <i>other</i> users will be able to make the correct action or choice and successfully navigate through the interface.
    Users are asked to “think aloud” as they work. The “think-aloud” approach provides user interface evaluators with a
    means for better understanding the users’ problems and thought processes as they interact with the interface.<br />
    During this segment of the usability and accessibility evaluation, participants are asked to complete the tasks
    comprising the evaluation. The start of the task evaluation is signaled, and the user works through the task until he
    or she is stuck and needs help, or the task is completed, at which time the user signals to the evaluation conductor
    that the evaluation is complete.<br />
    In a typical usability and accessibility evaluation, the evaluation coordinator is discouraged from interacting with
    the end user. In a cognitive walkthrough, this is more difficult, because one person must act as the “computer” by
    moving the user from screen to screen; however, even in this case, there is no reason the “computer” should be
    providing task-related help to the evaluation participant.<br />
    If there is more than one person performing the evaluation, one of the people should be designated as the lead, and
    only this person should interact with the evaluation participant throughout the course of the study.<br />
    During each of the tasks, an evaluation coordinator will record evaluation participant comments while completing the
    task, errors made during the task, and task completion times.<br />
    Typically, three trials of each task will be run during the course of the study to determine the effect of learning.
    Mastery of the task is assessed on the third trial, when it is expected that users will complete the task without
    critical (unrecoverable) errors.<br />
    During a usability and accessibility evaluation, typical measures that might be taken include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Time to complete a task. The evaluation conductor signals the start of a task. The participant signals task
            completion.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Unrecoverable errors. These are errors that the user does not correct and which result in the incorrect
            completion of a task. Unrecoverable errors also occur when a user gives up on a task and requests outside
            intervention in the form of a help call to the evaluation conductor.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Recoverable errors. These are errors of confusion and navigation that the participant makes that do not result
            in the incorrect completion of a task or require outside intervention. Recoverable errors typically result in
            extended completion times and lower user satisfaction.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>These data are collected with a usability evaluation-logging tool. An example can be found on the Web site: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <a href="http://w3.software.ibm.com/ucd/html/tools.html"><u>http://w3.software.ibm.com/ucd/html/tools.html</u></a>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>User satisfaction measures. These subjective measures, usually in the form of a questionnaire, ask evaluation
participants to rate their satisfaction in completing various tasks and whether they believe other users, with like skills,
will be able to successfully complete tasks using the conceptual model prototype. 
<p>
    <b>Debriefing</b><br />
    During debriefing, evaluation participants will complete any subjective satisfaction questionnaire. To reduce the
    chance for bias being recorded in the responses to the questionnaire, the questionnaires should be completed before any
    discussion with the evaluation conductor begins.<br />
    Once the satisfaction questionnaires have been completed, the evaluation conductor can ask specific questions regarding
    user comments or actions regarding particular tasks. The intent of this interview is to solicit suggestions for
    improving the design or to gain an understanding of why the evaluation participant struggled with particular areas of
    the user interface.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Gather all the collected data, including logging sheets from observations and questionnaires completed by
            evaluation participants.

    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
