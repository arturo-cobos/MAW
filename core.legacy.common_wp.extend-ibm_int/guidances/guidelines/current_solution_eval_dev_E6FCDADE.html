    The process for creating Current Solution Evaluations depends on the solution being described and the aspects of it
    that are most important. When a comparison is to be made, similar approaches should be taken to document each solution.
    Hands-on use of an application is the best way to examine it, and user interviews are useful to supplement first hand
    experience. Observation of users and an analysis of their tasks are also appropriate.<br />
    For a user-based subjective walkthrough and assessment of current or competitive solution, a usability lab can be
    utilized to monitor and videotape user actions and screens as well as to log and time-stamp comments and
    observations.<br />
    Steps that can be followed for user-based assessment include:<br />
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. Identification of the current and/or competitive solution for evaluation.<br />
        2. Creation of typical scenarios that exercise representative tasks.<br />
        3. Having the user walk through the solution while “thinking aloud” and evaluating the solution.<br />
        4. Having the user list strengths and weaknesses of the current solution concerning task support.<br />
        5. Having the user rate each task support strength and weakness according to importance (or frequency) and
        satisfaction.<br />
        6. Finding as many users as possible. Use a minimum of 6-10. For statistical significance, 15-30 users typically
        are used. Ensure that the disabled population of employees is represented.<br />
        7. Having users rate the strengths and weaknesses list generated by an expert user according to importance,
        frequency, and satisfaction.<br />
        8. Having the users add any missing strengths and weaknesses.<br />
        9. Having the users add any additional comments about the current/competitive solution.<br />
        10. Summarizing the data to identify wants and needs, areas of satisfaction and problems, and common trends.
        Present your reports in accessible formats.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    For a formal user-based performance benchmark of the current/competitive solution, conduct the assessment as above
    while eliminating the “thinking aloud” protocol. Using a logging facility, such as PC Logger, record and timestamp user
    performance data and errors. Summarize the time on task and error rates for inclusion in the report. Identify
    bottlenecks in the current/competitive solution that should be addressed in the new solution. This performance testing
    of the current/competitive system is analogous to testing the new solution, which is more fully illustrated in the
    Usability Testing work product.<br />
    A heuristic evaluation evaluates the current/competitive solution according to standard design guidelines or “rules of
    thumb.” Nielsen provides an example of a set of heuristic guidelines (see Section 8, References).
