                This field indicates how the class is implemented. This may be as an SGML/XML element or attribute, as a
                RDB column or table, as an object or an attribute in the document management system or as an object in
                customization code. This field may take the values: SGML, XML, RDB, DMS, and PGM. This field may be
                multi-valued since a class may exist as an SGML/XML attribute and a document management system attribute,
                for example. In these cases, it may be important for the system to automatically keep the values in the
                document and the document management system synchronized.

                true â€˜containsâ€™ relationship, not an â€˜is a kind ofâ€™ relationship.<br />
                This class may contain emphasis class objects.

                This field references any document classes from which this class of information can inherit behaviors,
                content or attribute definitions (these are sometimes called â€˜superclassesâ€™). This can be useful
                information when implementing the information design since style specifications and other behaviors may be
                directly used or copied and modified from the referenced superclasses. If context is important to the
                determination of which â€˜superclassâ€™ applies, that should be noted in this field.<br />
                Customer Name is a subclass of the Text class of object. It is used only within text fields. Customer Name
                instances may be contained by Heading objects but is not a kind of Heading object.

                must be changed concurrently, that would be a useful piece of information to record here.<br />

                Customer Name objects are typeset using the same font and point size as the text that surrounds them. For
                online applications, the customer name is used to generate a link to customer information that is
                appropriate based on the context in which the Customer Name object is being used; for example, in a
                customer service application, the link would be to all a list of all orders received from the customer in
                the last 90 days.<br />
                When used in mailing labels, the customerâ€™s name must be set in all uppercase.
