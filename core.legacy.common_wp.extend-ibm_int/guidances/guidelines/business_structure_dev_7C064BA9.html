    This work product would require the list of all the organizational sub-processes in order to design deployment
    architecture.&nbsp; The objective of the structure design is to put in place a structure that is suitable for the
    strategic position of the firm, so the desired strategic position will be a key input.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The summary of the inputs:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Documentation that describes the client's business units & operating locations
    </li>
    <li>
        The enterprise model&nbsp; & list of sub-processes
    </li>
    <li>
        The list of generic sub-processes of the customers, the suppliers, and partners of the enterprise
    </li>
    <li>
        The desired strategic position of the business
    </li>
    <li>
        The client's organization chart (as-is and potential)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <em><u>Steps:</u></em>
</p>
<p>
    The following steps are required for the development of this work product:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understand the strategic position of the firm
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the business units & operating locations for the organization through client documentation and/or
        interviews
    </li>
    <li>
        Break down the client's enterprise (across all its business units) into sub-processes. Use the sub- process
        template (Reference - Sub Process Template) to describe the sub-processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine also the key sub-processes of the suppliers, customers and partners of the company (complementors,
        partners,)
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand the business capabilities required
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop the "as is " model of the enterprise as follows :
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Develop a list of "as is" sub-processes sorted by related activities and arrange the sub-processes by
                related activities into Logical Work Groupings.&nbsp; This can be done in a work session with client
                executives.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conduct a review session with the client to review the Logical Work Groupings work with the client and make
                any adjustments necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Capture the current configuration of the sub processes at various levels - Corporation, group, division
                etc. The configuration can be drawn as a Logical Location map. This can be done in a work session with the
                client executives as follows ( Reference : Template for business structure)
            </li>
            <li>
                Study the sub-processes across business units. &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify the sub-processes which are such that they can/ should be executed by a unique unit in the
                enterprise for the whole corporation and hence can be consolidated or centralized.&nbsp; Here each
                sub-process delivers the business requirements of all the business units in the enterprise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify the sub-processes which are such that they can deliver the business capabilities of all the
                business units:
            </li>
            <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a Group - if they are Group replicable
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        within a Corporation - if they are corporate replicable
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        within a division - If they are division replicable), but required to be deployed and executed
                        separately by the different units. Hence these are sub processes which can be replicated.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify the sub-processes which are such that they deliver business capabilities unique to a given
                business unit and hence need to be designed, deployed and executed specifically for the given business
                unit. The nature of these sub processes will be different for different business units. These processes are
                business unit specific or dispersed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Note that the "as is" model development is only to understand the business structure, to determine the issues that
        associated with the current business structure and to identify any opportunities for improvement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Design the "to be" business structure based on:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                The competitive positioning that the business desires in the segment.&nbsp; For example: For a business
                that wants to move from "cost" to "value" as a basis of competition the design of the "to be" will ensure
                more "replicable" configuration of its sub-processes.
            </li>
            <li>
                The nature of the business capability.&nbsp; For example: for the business capability that is primarily
                focused on lowering cost, a "centralized" configuration for the associated sub-processes may be more
                suitable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Opportunities for economies identified while analyzing the "as is" structure.&nbsp; The opportunities for
                economies will be in terms of economies of scale, scope and experience.
            </li>
            <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The economies of scale can be gained by more centralization of the processes across the business
                        units
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The economies of scope can be gained by replicating the processes across the various business
                        units, i.e., if the same process can deliver the capabilities of multiple business units.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The "to be" business structure design can be done in working sessions with the client executives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the important linkages between the sub processes and analyze the exchange of information between those
        sub-processes.&nbsp; This can be done for sub processes within the enterprise and for sub-processes of the
        suppliers and customers.&nbsp; The linkages can be understood in terms of Specificity and Variability of the
        exchanged information. (Reference: Data Linkages between sub processes.)<br />
