    Application Management Plan is usually created during transition based on the information in the contract.
</p>
<p>
    As far as the information needed for the Application Management Plan exists in the contract, it must be copied directly
    and not be reworked. This is not only for productivity gains but is more importantly due to the fact that the contract
    is legally binding and that there is a business case behind the committed services and activities.
</p>
<p>
    When the contract does not include the necessary information for creation of the Application Management Plan,
    information is gathered and agreed upon with the client during the Transition Project. When there is no Transition
    Project or if the Application Management Plan is not delivered by the Transition Project, the Project Executive
    initiates its creation and obtains necessary information and agreements from the client. Application Management Plan is
    usually owned by the Project Executive and created or taken over (after the transition) by the Delivery Project
    Manager/Executive.
</p>
<p>
    Application Management Plan is a formal document and, as such, needs to be formally approved by the Project Executive
    after the client reviews it. Application Management Plan is updated and re-approved at least once a year and whenever
    the Project Executive or the Delivery Project Manager/Executive judge necessary (e.g., if scope is extended by new
    applications).
</p>
<p>
    Any deviations from mandatory IBM procedures must also be documented in the Application Management Plan. Such
    deviations need to be formally approved as required by the procedure that is deviated.
</p>
<p>
    The diagram below shows the typical activities associated with maintenance engagements and shows where the Application
    Management Plan is created and updated.<br />

    <strong>Planning</strong><br />
    The Delivery Project Manager/Executive together with the client plans maintenance and enhancement activities. The
    planning activities need to be described in the Application Management Plan. The main result from this activity is the
    development of a Master Plan whose contents and routines for its approval are included in the Application Management
    Plan.<br />
    The most important planning activity is prioritization of Service Requests. The Service Request backlog is prioritized
    regularly (e.g., quarterly) together with the client in a formal meeting. Alternatively, suggested priorities may be
    presented to an authorized client representative for approval. Frequency of this prioritization and routines for the
    approvals should be described in the Application Management Plan.<br />
    <strong>Reviews and Reports</strong><br />
    IBM and client management is informed regularly of the service status via formal meetings, Service Status Reports,
    informal contacts, and by other means as specified in the Application Management Plan. Beside these information
    meetings, client and internal review and approval meetings are also arranged according to what is required by the
    Application Management Plan.<br />
    Usually, these requirements apply:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Service Status Reports must be produced according to the contract and distributed according to the Application
        Management Plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Internal reports must be produced and distributed according to the Application Management Plan.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Measurements must be performed and included in the reports as defined in the Application Management Plan.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Formal meetings defined in the Application Management Plan must be held and documented.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            QA reviews must be held. QA reviews are among formal reviews to ensure that services are delivered in a way
            that fulfills IBM's contractual commitments, meets business objectives, and results in a satisfied client.
            These are the normal QA reviews:<br />
            - QA1, QA2, and QA3 for new or added contracts and proposals<br />
            - QA4 at service-start<br />
            - QA5 review of the contract at least once a year<br />
            - QA6 review of new releases and at contract close<br />
            - QA4, QA5, and QA6 reviews of development and enhancement projects<br />
            <br />
