<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><strong>1. Document Recoverable Solution States & Supporting Application Information States</strong> <br />
Document the application information states that define each valid, recoverable business state for each business process of
interest in the solution. <br />
<strong>2. Define Solution Recovery States</strong> <br />
Examine the relationship between applications and business processes, and the individual business states within each
business process. Identify the recovered end point states for each recoverable solution state, and for each end point
within each process. There are often several states that an end point can occupy within the confines of a business process
solution state. <br />
<strong>3. Define End Point Recovery Base State</strong> <br />
Define the minimum information content and currency state for each end point to support recovery of any of the solution
business processes. This may involve end point information not directly related to every recoverable business process, but
necessary to place the end point in a stable operating condition. AN example is populating order history in an order entry
application, prior to recovery of the order entry process. The history is not used directly during order entry, but
supports status queries also handled through the application. <br />
<strong>4. Define Recovery Sequence</strong> <br />
There are two recovery sequences that must defined for each end point failure. The first is the order of business process
recovery. There are cases where one business process depends directly upon the results of another. An example is the need
to reconstruct a detailed manufacturing plan prior to restarting manufacturing execution. <br />
The second recovery sequence is the order of end point recovery within each business process. An example of this is the
recovery of a partner information mastering application, and the using applications for that partner information. It is
necessary for the information master to be recovered before queries against the information can be allowed. <br />
<strong>5. Detail Recovery Requirements</strong> <br />
Capture in a use case description, at a conceptual level, any end point or business process specific constraints that need
to be accommodated in the recovery process. These often include end point access constraints. <br />
<strong>6. Define End Point Instrumentation Requirements</strong> <br />
End points vary dramatically in their ability to provide introspection to their operational states, as defined by the state
of the information they manage. It is essential that these states be made available externally to facilitate managed
recovery of the end point, and the associated business processes. Each end point must have its facilities, and limitations
with respect to internal information state visibility documented, so that appropriate instrumentation can be included in
the recovery implementation. When the end point is a business partner’s systems, or another business unit’s systems, these
requirements can ultimately be reflected in the trading partner agreement for the partner or unit.</td>
