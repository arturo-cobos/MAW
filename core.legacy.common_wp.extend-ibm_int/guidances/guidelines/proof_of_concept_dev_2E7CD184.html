    The need for a To-Be, or Future State, Proof of Concept will occur at various times during the life of the project, and
    the development approach will vary based on the time the issue is discovered, the data which is available, and the
    objectives of the test. During the initial process assessment and analysis phases of project, a proof of concept may be
    used to identify and highlight problem areas.&nbsp; During preliminary process design, a proof of concept may be used
    to validate the process design prior to actual detail design and implementation so as to minimize risk to the final
    outcome. The Proof of Concept may include a computer simulation, a role-playing simulation of the process (known as
    gaming), other visualization techniques or developing a prototype.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    There are various ways of doing a Proof of Concept, these are explained below. For advice and guidance of the different
    ways refer to Chapter Seven of this document.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Computer simulation
    </li>
    <li>
        Gaming (role-playing simulation of the process)
    </li>
    <li>
        Visualization techniques
    </li>
    <li>
        Developing a prototype
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Computer Simulation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Below is a general approach for developing the work product.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify/Clarify - A project team member or stakeholder will raise issues, formally or informally, with the process
        being proposed.&nbsp; These issues must be clearly articulated, or a conclusive test can not be designed.&nbsp;
        Hypotheses must be developed which need to be proven or disproven.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test Planning - Design a test, which addresses the hypotheses.&nbsp; Determine the data and other resources that
        are required to execute the test.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test Execution - Run and re-run the test until conclusive data is developed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze Results - Review the data produced, and determine if the hypotheses have been proven or disproven.&nbsp;
        Develop conclusions and action steps.
    </li>
    <li>
        Publish - Produce the final version of the work product, and circulate it among the stakeholders. Consider a
        de-briefing session to address remaining questions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Throughout the process, consider using workshops and other techniques to engage the stakeholders in the process.&nbsp;
    This should facilitate acceptance of the results.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Gaming</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A simulation with the goal of supporting change of business processes and the related organizations is called
    gaming.&nbsp; With gaming most often a group of employees performs a (part of) business process in a classroom with
    mock clients, suppliers, departments, documents and computer systems.&nbsp; A script is used to trigger the players to
    execute the different business process activities. In this way the process is simulated and the design will be
    validated.
</p>
<p>
    In successfully changing business processes, gaming can be a great help in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understanding/awareness of, and acceptance by employees of the new business challenges: reducing anxiety and
        insecurity of employees, improving commitment and willingness to change. Doing this will solve potential conflicts
        in advance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Educating/training employees: enhance their process-thinking, showing them how they should work together, how they
        should solve certain issues that might arise, how responsibilities are allocated. Educating and training employees
        should improve the communication and the co-operation, improving communication and co-operation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing hypotheses/assumptions around the new mode of operation: will the defined-but-not-yet-implemented business
        process work, will it result in achieving the process objectives?&nbsp; This will reduce the risks.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The framework to design and run a simulation game consists of ten steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Define objectives and scope of gaming
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze and understand
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand the essential elements of the process and how they influence each other
    </li>
    <li>
        Define requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Translate all results from the previous step to game elements.&nbsp; The deliverable of this step is "a game on
        paper".
    </li>
    <li>
        Construct and test the prototype
    </li>
    <li>
        The deliverable for this step is the simulation game package and tested prototype.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optimize prototype
    </li>
    <li>
        The objective of this step is to optimize the prototype based on the test-feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
        Execute gaming
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluation
    </li>
    <li>
        Lessons learned
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The success of the game depends on three main factors:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Quality of preparation<br />
        </strong> The introduction should be presented in a way that the game leader sells the concept to the
        players.&nbsp; The players must be aware and have a clear picture of the objectives, roles, rules of game and how
        they are measured during the simulation game.<br />
        Players must be selected carefully.&nbsp; Wrong players will generate disinterest during the game.&nbsp; Experience
        shows that the right players are the people who fulfil the future roles.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Quality of game leader</strong><br />
        The game leader must guide the players through the journey of learning moments and make sure that the players
        experience the desired learning moments.&nbsp; He or she must understand and be responsive to all situations.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Quality of coaching and evaluation</strong><br />
        During the game, players are confronted with many situations that are different from their daily operation. Many
        values and principles of their daily operation will not work during the simulation game.&nbsp; This may generate
        feelings among the players, such as insecurity and anxiety.&nbsp; These are the forces of resistance or reluctance
        to change.<br />
        It is important for the game leader to identify these moments and coach the players through the learning
        cycle.<br />
        Evaluate findings and present results to client during the simulation game, many findings indicate the ‘blind
        spots’ of the new process or environment. Improvement ideas are the proposed solutions to make the process
        work.&nbsp; Both must be evaluated, presented and translated into the next action to keep the momentum of change
        moving.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Visualization<br />
    </strong> In addition to gaming, there are many other ways to do process visualization; choose the method that is
    appropriate for your client.
</p>
<p>
    Effective ways to visualize the future (business) process include
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Storyboards
    </li>
    <li>
        Pre-prototypes
    </li>
    <li>
        Animation
    </li>
    <li>
        Role playing
    </li>
    <li>
        Video tapes
    </li>
    <li>
        Computer graphics
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Having chosen the medium, use the following guidelines in developing the visualization sessions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use graphical images, symbols, stories, realistic examples and business situations
    </li>
    <li>
        Aim for a clear, consistent message
    </li>
    <li>
        Illustrate what is new and different:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Process steps and flows Rules
            </li>
            <li>
                Technology
            </li>
            <li>
                Skills and organization
            </li>
            <li>
                Geography
            </li>
            <li>
                Customer relationships
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ensure that the key stakeholders participate in the visualization and that the sessions portray a clear view of the
    future process.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Prototyping</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A prototype is a scale model of a business system design used for demonstration, study or testing on which later
    decisions are based or judged.&nbsp; Prototypes focus on bringing potentially abstract concepts "to life" and achieving
    timely "buy-in".
</p>
<p>
    They can be used to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Demonstrate that the concept is possible
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstrate the "future" as it will be with the new business system design
    </li>
    <li>
        Increase client participation and "buy-in"
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtain quick feedback on potential payoff
    </li>
    <li>
        Get a "physical" perspective on the redesigned system
    </li>
    <li>
        Speed up the refinement, revision and testing of the business system design
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilitate organizational learning
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Prototyping can be used at various stages in an engagement, from selling the 'art of the possible' early on in the
    engagement through to setting up a fully functioning 'model office' capable of processing real work just prior to
    implementation.<br />
