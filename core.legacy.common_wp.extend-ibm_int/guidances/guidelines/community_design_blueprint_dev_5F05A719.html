    The Community Design Blueprint is the output created primarily from the findings of the Community Design Workshop. The
    community leaders and core team work together to accomplish the following:
</p>
<p>
    1. Determine the initial community membership<br />
    2. Determine the mechanisms or enablers that will help community members to create, share, and apply knowledge more
    effectively.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The <u>roles</u> that will need to be defined in order to further the mission of the community.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The particular <u>technologies</u> that will be deployed and maintained in support of the community.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The <u>events</u> or venues in which community members will interact with one another.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A model of the shared <u>content</u> that will be developed by and for the community to support more effective
            creation, sharing, and application of knowledge.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><br />
3. Determine the appropriate relationship between the community and the formal organization(s) from which its members are
drawn. 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Will members be assigned to the commuity or will membership be purely voluntary?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Will the community make decisions by consensus or will a leadership body be created?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            What financial support will the community require and what will be the source(s) of that support?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How will the community be accountable (if at all) to the sources of its support, to the business units from
            which it draws members, and to the enterprise?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    4. Determine how the community will measure its progress and contribution to the overall organization<br />
    5. Refine community design with working group members and other key stakeholders
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Determine initial list of community members</strong><br />
    This step determines who will be included as members of the community in its initial form.<br />
    <u>Considerations:</u><br />
    The single most important factor in the success of any community is its membership —the people who make up the
    community. The primary objective with respect to membership is identifying those individuals who are interested and
    engaged with the area of knowledge that is the focus of the community. Depending upon the client situation, however,
    the selection of members may also be driven by one or more of the following design issues:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            How do we ensure cohesion & shared commitment among the members of the newly formed community?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How do we ensure diversity of viewpoints within the newly formed community?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How do we ensure adequate representation across functions, business units, geographies, etc.?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How do we ensure connectedness to other communities?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How do we ensure credibility and standing of the newly formed community?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How do we ensure a balance of more seniority and/or expertise levels?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>Evidence bearing upon the above questions may be obtained through a variety of means including semi-structured
interviews, workshops with prospective community members, and Social Capital Analysis. **<br />
<u>Key Dependencies:</u> <br />
In defining the membership of the community, practitioners should consider possible dependencies between membership
decisions and other aspects of the community design. For example: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the size and/or breadth of the community and the availability and scalability of technology enablers
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the disciplinary diversity of the community membership and the viability of a single information model
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the range of organizations represented within the community and the difficulty of implementing
            measurement and accountability.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Determine the community enablers</strong><br />
    This step identifies the roles, technologies, events, and content strategies that enable the creation, sharing, and
    application of knowledge by the community.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Roles</strong><br />
    Define the roles that will be required in order to further the mission of the community.<br />
    <u>Considerations:</u><br />
    Roles may include volunteer roles (those undertaken in addition to formal job responsibilities as well as dedicated
    roles (those undertaken as part of formal job responsibilities). Roles may apply to members of the community as well as
    to members of a designated support function. Depending upon the client situation, the identification of roles may
    address any of the following questions…
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will be responsible for maintaining the community’s repositories, portals, and other IT applications?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will provide user support and training on those applications?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will monitor usage of those systems and relate that usage to work activities and outcomes?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will represent the community to sponsoring or governing bodies?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will monitor and communicate developments on a given topic of interest to community members
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will coordinate community events (e.g., conferences, ad hoc meetings, teleconferences)?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will produce community newsletters, newswires, to keep members apprised of internal, technical, and
            competitive developments?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will research and produce periodic reports on the state of the community (i.e., community activities, their
            impact, and return on investment in community development)?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><u>Key Dependencies:</u> <br />
In defining roles for the community, practitioners should consider possible dependencies between these decisions and other
aspects of the community design. For example: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the budget for dedicated support and the willingness of community members to take on operational
            responsibilities themselves.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the budget for dedicated support and the scope and sophistication of technology enablement provided to
            the community
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the subject-matter knowledge of available support staff and the knowledge-requirements of particular
            support roles
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For a description of common community roles, as well as the knowledge, skills and abilities to support those roles,
    please see the presentation located in the ICM Asset Web, “Community Roles”. This presentation was developed from
    research conducted by the IKM.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Technologies</strong><br />
    Define the technologies that will be deployed and maintained in support of the community.<br />
    <u>Considerations:</u><br />
    Technologies may include (but are not be limited to) tools for profiling the interests and expertise of community
    members, tools enabling community members to develop shared repositories of unstructured information, and tools for
    enabling community members to collaborate effectively around problems of common interest. Depending upon the client
    situation, the following questions may be used to define opportunities for technology enablement:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            How can members find other people interested in or knowledgeable about a given topic (e.g., personal home
            pages, on-line directories, adaptive profilers)?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How can members access data, information, or materials they need in their day-to-day work (e.g., shared
            databases, portals, search engines, tools for database annotation, document management systems)?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How can members collaborate effectively around problems of common interest (e.g., video-teleconferencing,
            on-line threaded discussions, virtual teamrooms, collaboratory environments)?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How can members track external developments effectively (e.g., “profile & push” applications, portals,
            notification technologies)?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How can members validate or warrant information in shared repositories (e.g., rating technologies, adaptive
            profilers, collaboratory environments)?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How can members share experiences in order to establish trust and shared context with one another (e.g.,
            video-teleconferencing, on-line threaded discussion, collaboratory environments)?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><u>Key Dependencies”</u> <br />
In identifying enabling technologies for the community, practitioners should consider possible dependencies between
technology selection and other aspects of the community design. For example: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the budget for dedicated support and the scope and sophistication of technology enablement provided to
            the community
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the provision of tools for virtual collaboration and opportunities for community members to build trust
            via face-to-face interaction
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the storage and access capabilities of enabling technologies and the requirements of the domain
            knowledge (content) model for the community
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

    and technologies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Events</strong><br />
    Define the events or venues in which community members will interact with one another.<br />
    <u>Considerations:</u><br />
    Events may be virtual--asynchronous (e.g., on-line, threaded discussions), virtual—synchronous (e.g.,
    video-teleconferences), and face-to-face (e.g., conferences, knowledge fairs, and ad hoc meetings). Depending upon the
    particular client situation, the following questions may be used to design community events that are “fit to purpose”
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            How important is the <u>timeliness</u> with which an event affects the transfer of knowledge? For example,
            information entered into a discussion database is available immediately to community members. Information
            transmitted face-to-face would have to wait until the next community meeting.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How important is the <u>scale</u> at which an event affects the transfer of knowledge? An intranet bulletin
            board scales quite easily from a few to thousands of members. Video-teleconferences, by contrast, become
            unwieldy beyond a dozen or so participants.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How important is the <u>degree to which an event disrupts schedules</u> and on-going business processes?
            On-line, asynchronous discussions are minimally disruptive—participants can plug in from wherever they are at
            whatever time they find convenient. Face-to-face meetings, particularly in the case of global communities, tend
            to be expensive, disruptive to schedules, and may even affect operational “readiness” in some organizations.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How important is the <u>richness</u> of human interaction that an event supports? Face-to-face meetings enable
            rich, “high-bandwidth” interaction. Teleconferences filter out much the interpersonal information that makes
            for a rich interaction, and asynchronous events such as discussion databases reduce richness still further.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><u>Key Dependencies:</u> <br />
In designing events for the community, practitioners should consider possible dependencies between events and other aspects
of the community design. For example: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the form and scale of virtual events and the capability of enabling technologies to support those
            events
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the labor required to plan and conduct “face-to-face” events and the definition of community support
            roles
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between reliance on virtual events and the diversity/heterogeneity of the community membership
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Information Model and Governance</strong><br />
    Define a model of the shared information or <u>content</u> that will be developed by and for the community in order to
    support more effective creation, sharing, and application of knowledge.<br />
    <u>Considerations:</u><br />
    Depending upon the level of detail in which the information model is specified, it may include information concerning
    the current form and location of needed content, the relative difficulty of obtaining that content, the descriptors
    and/or metadata structures according to which the content should be organized. It should also address how the community
    will manage this content in conjunction with the knowledge lifecycle, and what standard practices or policies will
    support the governance of this content.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Determine the relationship of the community to the formal organization</strong><br />
    This step determines the appropriate relationship between the community and the formal organization(s) from which its
    members are drawn.<br />
    <u>Considerations:</u><br />
    In their relationship to the larger organization, communities may range from informal interest networks to somewhat
    more structured competency groups to <i>de facto</i> departments or centers of excellence (although the latter might
    arguably be excluded from the definition “community”). The following questions may be helpful in defining the
    appropriate relationship between the community and the formal organization
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Will members be assigned to the commuity or will membership be purely voluntary?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Will the community make decisions by consensus or will a leadership body be created?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            What financial support will the community require and what will be the source(s) of that support?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How will the community be accountable (if at all) to the sources of its support, to the business units from
            which it draws members, and to the enterprise?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><u>Key Dependencies:</u> <br />
In defining the relationship between the community and the formal organization, practitioners should consider possible
dependencies between this relationship and other aspects of the community design. For example: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the accountability of the community to the larger organization and the definition of member roles
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between processes for community decision-making and governance and the design of events through which the
            community can meet to manage its affairs
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Between the level of financial support to the community and the cost (implementation and ownership) of enabling
            technologies
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><strong>Determine how the community will measure its progress and contribution to the overall organization</strong>
<br />
There are two primary sets of measurements that need to be addressed when designing communities of practice: <br />
<i>Progress measures</i>: These measures are designed to understand the level and type of activity within the community.
These could include measures such as: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Number of registered community members
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Number of individuals contributing to a repository
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Number of submissions to the repository
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Number of individuals attending community events
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><i>Outcome measures</i>: These measures are designed to evaluate the impact of the community on the formal
organization. These could include measures such as: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Time saved due to reuse of existing assets
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            New business won using community-developed responses to problems
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            New products developed as a result of community interaction
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Decrease in response time to customer needs
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Using outcome measures often requires the use of stories to connect the activities, results and business outcomes
    together in a meaningful package. These results can be then interpreted and used as part of a larger business case with
    supporting assumptions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Refine community design and review with client.</strong>The creation of a community design blueprint is
    iterative. The consulting team will often draft parts of the blueprint and then work with the client’s knowledge
    management organization and the community members to refine the design, evaluate tradeoffs and suggest potential
    implementation challenges. Therefore, this step should be repeated several times during the development of the
    blueprint as working group schedules allow.

        ** Note that a recent IBM study has indicated that communities of practice should typically contain between 50 and
        200 individuals. Although some communities may be larger, these may more effectively be treated as sub-groups to
        the larger overall community.<br />
