    The first step in creating a Network Specified Design is to collect and review the already existing network strategy
    and conceptual design outputs. The deliverables from these prior phases are used to create and validate the additional
    detail of the Network Specified Design.
</p>
<p>
    The second step is to add network functionality (i.e., routing, switching, servers, network management, etc.) to the
    Network Conceptual Design depicting where the functionality will be performed via which node or component in the
    network.
</p>
<p>
    Specific elements could include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Network Specified Design validation criteria documented in node/connection profiles&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Network Specified Design topology diagrams and supporting textual descriptions&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical and non-technical advantages/disadvantages of the proposed Network Specified Design&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Description of the proposed network operations and network management<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The third step is to design a local diagram for each location type as defined in the location profiles. For example,
    start at a store, or factory, or distribution center before tackling the entire wide area network.
</p>
<p>
    At each location type the following will need to be done:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Review user profiles and application profiles for network specific requirements – this will dictate certain node
        and connection characteristics like protocols, availability, security, capacity, manageability, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Using personal background and experience with network node and connection types start constructing alternative
        scenarios that will meet the requirements. For example, the common node type in individual locations used to
        connect individual user nodes (i.e., PCs) is a hub. A common node type to connect to the Internet or WAN is a
        router. A common connection type used to connect node type hub to node type user PC is a LAN – either Ethernet or
        token-ring.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Since many options exist at this stage of the design (based around client preference, certain standard or protocols
        needing to be supported), it is best at this point to create anywhere from two to four alternative Conceptual
        Network Design scenarios. Each of the alternate designs will have its own set of advantages and disadvantages, with
        the recommended design most closely matching client business needs, IT Strategy, and network requirements and
        strategy.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        All the alternative designs should meet the basic client business and network requirements. However, it is
        recommended that these alternatives be discussed with the client network design and architecture team before the
        designs are presented to client management in order to allow the client team to share their thoughts on which
        design meets their needs the best. Assuming the client technical team and IBM technical team agree, the recommended
        design will be posed to management, with the backup alternate designs ready to review in case questions
        arise.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The fourth step is to connect the locations into an enterprise network (assuming the scope of the engagement is to
    create both a ‘local’ as well as ‘wide area’ network). Similar steps as above need to happen in the creation of a wide
    area Conceptual Network Design.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Review to location to location profile information for details concerning how locations need to communicate.
        Additionally, this is the point where the entire breadth of telecommunications traffic needs to be taken into
        account. For example, most clients have voice, data, video, mobile communications, fax, and wireless networks. The
        designer at this point needs to keep all of these networks in mind when designing an overall enterprise
        network.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Again, using personal background and experience with network node and connection types, the designer will start to
        construct scenarios that meet the overall client business and technical requirements. Node types that exist at this
        point include high-speed switches, multiplexers, and other typically very high-speed transmission devices.
        Connection types can be various internetworking services such as T1 links, frame relay, or ATM.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        As above, alternate scenarios should be developed since there is typically ‘no right answer’. Pros and cons of each
        alternate scenario should be developed, and a preliminary recommended Conceptual Network Design identified.<br />
        The designs should all be reviewed with the client telecommunications technical team, and the recommended design
        presented to client management.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The fifth step is to add network sizing. The design specifies recommendations on sizing and capacity of lines or links.
    Many times this information can only be estimated using network data collection tools to determine the current network
    capacity (current state), apply client growth projections, and apply a modeling tool to arrive at projections (future
    state). At this point many design options may be evaluated against the client’s requirements.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Specific elements could include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Network sizing (performance & capacity) data (historical/current and projected/future)&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Discussion of configuration fault impact (Capacity, Reliability, Availability, etc.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Potential risk factors in implementing the recommended specified design<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical reference information
    </li>
</ul></td>
