    The approach to develop the Process Flow Definition work product varies and depends on the objectives of the engagement
    and the required client deliverables. Typically, the definition and description of processes begins with the
    construction of a static view of the process (process identification or inventory). This may provide a process
    structure to identify the critical process areas, highlight the complex processes that need further definition for
    clarity and understanding and identify the scope of the business process under analysis. This is a scoping issue and is
    project dependent.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Developing the Process Flow:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify a process area from the process identification work product.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the triggering event associated to this process from the business events work product.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the performers. The level of a performer will depend on the process category.&nbsp; The performer may be
        an organizational unit, functional unit, individual, a set of skills, or a system that performs the activities or
        processes to which it is assigned.
    </li>
    <li>
        Begin placing the activities in the appropriate performer row on the process map. New performer roles may need to
        be created if the activity cannot be assigned to a single one.
    </li>
    <li>
        A control symbol must be used, if there is a point where the process may branch, or take more than one path.&nbsp;
        The control symbol will determine if all paths will be followed (in the case of an “AND” or Multithread), or if
        some choice must occur (in the case of an “OR” or Choice Box).&nbsp; In many cases, the Choice Box may cause the
        process to return to an earlier point for rework.&nbsp; This condition will be denoted with a Rework and Restart
        symbol.
    </li>
    <li>
        Flow lines indicate the flow of work and are the trigger that allows the next activity to begin.&nbsp; When
        multiple flow lines enter an activity, it is assumed that the first trigger to reach that activity will enable
        it.&nbsp; A wait construct must be used to synchronize the process if an activity must either wait to begin or wait
        to complete.&nbsp; The number within the wait construct indicates the number of inputs required.&nbsp; In some
        cases, this number may be a variable such as “N”.
    </li>
    <li>
        Relative time should flow left to right on the diagram, with the exception of a rework (revert). If activities
        occur simultaneously within the performer role line, use a Multithread to define the threads of work.
    </li>
    <li>
        Depending on your situation, you can annotate the processes with the following information to further detail the
        interactions:
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Annotate timings to show the amount of time necessary to complete each process.
            </li>
            <li>
                Show performance measures or goals for individual processes. This is particularly useful for the future
                process flow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Differentiate automated and manual process activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note problems and bottlenecks. This is particularly useful when the process map is used to record current
                processing flow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note those processes that represent leverage points or competitive advantage, offering the greatest
                potential for improved performance.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        When the process model is defined be sure to update the related work products
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                When the future state process has been developed, the roles will have to be mapped back to jobs.&nbsp; At
                this time, the job role work product may need to be updated as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depending on the engagement model and purpose, many other work products will use this as the basis for
                analysis and detail requirements definition.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Refining the Process Flow for Package Implementation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Additional detail in the operational view, and definition of the transactional view should also be modeled when
    implementing an application package, or when linking to application development activity is relevant.&nbsp; It is
    important to be able to explicitly communicate the design to all affected parties including the end users, project
    team, and partnering implementation resources.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the business process flow does not exist, it is still possible to start the process definition at this detailed
        level.&nbsp; If implementing a package, a reference model or industry template for the application may already
        exist.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify all activities that are to be performed using the application package, and replace these with transaction
        activities that map to the application.&nbsp; Identify the application references and note them in the proper
        fields.&nbsp; When mapping the activities to the application the process may need to change to accommodate the
        package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Walk through the process flow and at each transaction activity, bring up the designated reference point in the
        application and validate that the activity can be performed.
    </li>
    <li>
        If additional configuration, customization, or coding is required at any point note this as a requirement.&nbsp; If
        this requirement is an interface or API to another application or system, this should correlate to a Use Case
        Model, and/or a detailed description of the requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Often, a system performer will be required at this detailed level.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Information Gathering</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Workshops with project team members and domain experts (persons who actually work in the environment being modeled) are
    an effective way to gather information and build the model interactively as the workshop progresses.&nbsp;
    Alternatively, information-gathering sessions can be effective if there is quick turn-around of the evolving model in
    subsequent reviews.
</p>
<p>
    Some other excellent sources of information are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Information obtained from interviews, meetings and workshops
    </li>
    <li>
        Direct observation of the process
    </li>
    <li>
        Procedure manuals and other documentation from the business process.&nbsp; (Treat with skepticism if people who are
        not performing the activities wrote them as they may reflect desired procedures rather than actual practice.) But
        the process flows could also be future state (as mentioned in the description so then there is no problem)
    </li>
    <li>
        Administration and operational support documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing IC or templates, such as the Industry Based Templates for CRM package solutions. (put source in Reference
        chapter)
    </li>
    <li>
        Classified business terms containing key verbs and/or nouns (objects) extracted from business sources. These verbs,
        with their accompanying objects, can plug right into the process-modeling framework, to provide a first-cut process
        model.
    </li>
    <li>
        Other work products
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Process Identification identifies business processes
            </li>
            <li>
                Business Events identifies the external and internal events that are the initiating stimuli of&nbsp;
                processes/sub-processes.&nbsp; Also consider such initiating Business Events as emergencies or security
                threats or those associated with the Life Cycle of a use (eg issue access, use access, remove access).
                These provide useful starting points.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Current client process models and various instances if they exist
    </li>
    <li>
        Relevant standard industry models
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Whatever the source of the information, the approach to building the process model can be “top-down” (processes to
    sub-processes to activities) or “bottom-up” (understanding activities then identifying related
    sub-processes/processes).&nbsp; Also, it may be appropriate to understand the flow/relationships and customer
    interactions of the processes and sub-processes within scope then assess the importance, performance, maturity, etc.
