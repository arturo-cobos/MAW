    The steps for developing the Target Action Report are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Document the business goals,
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze maintenance log and backlog of service requests to determine high cost areas.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add Perfective Maintenance Actions from recommendations in the Candidate Report.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add Perfective Maintenance Actions based on business goals.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define Exit Criteria.
    </li>
    <li>
        Estimate Effort.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set priority for implementing actions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Document the business goals.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Produce a statement of the objectives of the perfective maintenance exercise.<br />
    These could be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reduce cost, of maintenance and enhancements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduce defects causing adverse impact on customer satisfaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve performance to ensure service level agreements are met.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure responsiveness to change requests critical to client business.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Responses in the Application Information Questionnaire can provide assistance here.
</p>
<p>
    Perfective maintenance actions are selected to support the business goals.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Analyze maintenance log and backlog of service requests to determine high cost areas.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The maintenance log can provide information on what functions or software components in the application are being
    worked on and which are most costly. Future costs are reflected in the backlog of service requests. Actions targeted at
    high cost areas are more likely to be cost effective.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Add Perfective Maintenance Actions from recommendations in the Candidate Report.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Review the recommendations in the Candidate Report taking into account the business goals and the high cost areas. If a
    main business goal is to reduce defects, then add actions to correct serious code flaws indicated in the Candidate
    Report. If decreasing maintenance costs is a goal and recommendations for restructuring and remodularizing are made in
    the Candidate Report, add actions to do this in the high cost areas (for software components with high levels of
    activity).
</p>
<p>
    Refer to Identifying Perfective Maintenance Actions Technique Paper for more details on how to select appropriate
    actions.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Add Perfective Maintenance Actions based on business goals.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Add actions beyond recommendations in the Candidate Report that address the business goals. Software components with
    high costs or defects associated with them may be improved through manual code improvement or redesign. Responsiveness
    to service requests may be improved by creating work products, such as design documents. Consider the overall structure
    of work products in SIMethod as depicted in the work product dependency diagrams.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Define Exit Criteria.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The exit criteria are a condition to be met for the action to be finished. The exit criteria for actions recommended in
    the Candidate Report are related to the selection criteria. For example, if the action is to remodularize a software
    component included in the Candidate Report based on selection criteria of cyclomatic complexity &gt; 10, then the exit
    criteria, Cyclomatic Complexity to be &lt; 11 follows from this.
</p>
<p>
    Exit criteria for actions creating documentation may be to complete successful review.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Estimate Effort.</b><br />
    Estimate the effort required to implement each of the Perfective Maintenance actions, that is, to meet the exit
    criteria.<br />
    The estimation of perfective maintenance actions is similar to estimating other code change actions. It can be useful
    to review specific instances of code to evaluate complexity of change.
</p>
<p>
    The availability of code understanding tool which enables the code structure to be seen graphically, can accelerate the
    code understanding, understanding the required code change, and the code change review.
</p>
<p>
    The effort estimation should take into account that actions have the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Receive action definition
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtain the current code (or document) version
    </li>
    <li>
        Run code evaluation tool (or Review document informally), to confirm the basis for change.
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand code (or document)
    </li>
    <li>
        Change code (or document)
    </li>
    <li>
        Run code evaluation tool (or review document informally) to establish exit criteria are met
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare documentation to enable review.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For the “Change code” step, consider the following perfective maintenance change types:
</p>
<p>
    <i>Code flaw changes -</i> Code flaws tend to be fairly straight forward, taking only an hour or two, depending on how
    complex the code is. One difficult code flaw to track down without a tool is recursion, especially in complex code or
    when the recursion is through many code modules. [For example A calls D, D calls G, G calls H, and H calls A]. A
    difficult recursion may take a day to determine its nature.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Structuring code</i> - The effort to improve code structure is dependent on the complexity of the code. Typically
    this is not a difficult task but made much easier with a tool. Single occurrences of ‘unstructuredness’ take an hour or
    two to correct. Highly unstructured software components having a high essential complexity may take days to fully
    structure. Estimating should be based on potential gains in the future and set to determine how much time to spend on
    structuring, that is, the goal may not be to fully structure the code, but to improve the structure.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Modularizing code</i> - Again the effort to modularize code depends on the code complexity and can be made easier
    using a tool. Also, estimating should be based on potential gains in the future and set to determine how much time to
    spend on modularization, that is, the goal may not be to achieve optimum modularization, but to improve the
    modularization. Breaking out a single module to simplify a complex module can take an hour or two, bringing a module
    from a cyclomatic complexity of 18 to two modules with cyclomatic complexity 10 and 8. Remodularizing code of
    cyclomatic complexity 70 to 170 in a meaningful way may take a day to a week resulting code more understandable and
    easier to maintain and improve.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Redesigning code</i> - The effort in redesigning code is likely to take at least a day, often several days, and a
    complex suite of code modules may require months to achieve. If the change is expected to be complex, estimation should
    be done in consultation with someone who is experienced with the code. Otherwise, allocate enough effort for an analyst
    application developer to become familiar with the requirement.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Prioritize Actions.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Assign implementation priority to each Perfective Maintenance action. The priority can either be Urgent, High, Medium,
    or Low based as follows.
</p>
<p>
    Urgent - urgent fix, such as serious code flaws.
</p>
<p>
    High – Meet business objective directly and is cost effective.
</p>
<p>
    Medium - average benefit can be gained.
</p>
<p>
    Low – action can wait until it is convenient to implement.
</p>
<p>
    The priority is based on business goals. If the business goal is to minimize defects, then actions that can remove
    defects have a higher priority. If the business goal is to reduce maintenance cost, then actions that can improve code
    understanding and reduce maintenance cost have a higher priority.
