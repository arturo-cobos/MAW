    <b><u>Guideline for GTS/IGA Conditions of Satisfaction (COS) Management</u></b>
</p>
<p>
    The Conditions of Satisfaction (COS) work product is developed through a series of simple, enhanced, structured
    discussions with the client to set and manage their expectations. The output from these discussions are recorded in the
    standalone COSCard and stored with the project/engagement documentation.
</p>
<p>
    <u><strong>Scope of COS</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
    Conditions of Satisfaction (COS) help define and manage client expectations by keeping us aligned with their priorities
    and expectations throughout the delivery of an individual engagement. The client’s conditions of satisfaction are
    captured and recorded to ensure that both the client and the IBMer understand what needs to be done to achieve the
    highest level of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
    COS statements frequently address subjective matters that reflect those things the client views as critical to the
    success of the project. However, COS statements should neither repeat what is already in the contract or Statement of
    Work, nor should they change the scope of the contract or Statement of Work. Help the client understand this
    distinction if they initially propose new or different contractual commitments.
</p>
<p>
    Subject areas to consider when helping your client define their expectations include such things as create value,
    communications, timeliness, skills transfer, leadership, commitment, flexibility, and responsiveness. Here are some
    examples of COS statements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Focus on solving the business problem rather than on implementing cutting edge technology for its own sake.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deliver a financial system per the project schedule that meets all the defined and agreed upon requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Respond to all inquiries/issues within agreed upon timeframes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clearly communicate via e-mail any delays or priority changes that will impact the timely completion of project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstrate the ability to adapt to changes and the flexibility to meet the client’s organizational needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep IBM project team members aware of project goals, processes, and targets.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u><strong>Value of Using COS</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
    Why should I develop and use the Conditions of Satisfaction?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Enables your client to state and solidify their priorities and make their satisfaction more objective
    </li>
    <li>
        Enables you to understand what actions you can take to achieve a satisfied client at the end of the engagement
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies when client requirements and expectations have changed during an engagement
    </li>
    <li>
        Helps you negotiate changes required to meet expectations
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensures that the client’s vision is realized
    </li>
    <li>
        Strengthens your relationship with the client
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Why should I complete the COSCard?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Maintains a record, for both you and the client, of what the client said was important at the time of the last COS
        meeting
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintains a record that shows we are aware of their expectations and priorities
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintains a record of what actions we committed to take
    </li>
    <li>
        Standard format that the client can recognize
    </li>
    <li>
        Standard recognizable format to communicate COS to team members
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>What COS is NOT?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        COS is not a survey, not a replacement for the Client Value Analysis-Transaction (CVA-T) survey done at the end of
        the project by a third party survey firm
    </li>
    <li>
        COS is not a form to be filled in by the client, but is to be completed by the Project Manager after discussion
        with the client
    </li>
    <li>
        COS is not a contract or an amendment to the contract/SOW
    </li>
    <li>
        COS is not a vehicle to allow the client to demand and/or document changes or additions to contractual requirements
        or performance
    </li>
    <li>
        COS is not something to be kept a secret from your project team
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Instead, share the client's expectations and COS review results with the project team
</p>
<p>
    Be selective about which Conditions of Satisfaction and COS results you share with subcontractors
</p>

                    set Interim Review dates, if appropriate, based on the project size.

                <p>
                    Interim Reviews should be conducted quarterly with the client by the PM. These reviews are informal
                    meetings with the client to review/monitor IBM’s performance in meeting the conditions set (or later
                    revised) and to identify gaps between the client’s expectations and what you are delivering. It is not
                    unusual that client priorities may change, resulting in new, reprioritized conditions of satisfaction.
                    Discuss them and adjust the COS list accordingly.

                    If your client’s expectations are not being met, develop an action plan that will address the necessary
                    improvements. Communicate these action plans to the IBM Team. This gives the IBM Team the opportunity
                    to resolve or close them before they become serious client sat issues.

                <p>
                    At the end of the project, meet with the client to determine if we have met or exceeded their
                    expectations, also covering performance, outstanding issues. Use this opportunity to discuss with the
                    client future business for IBM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remind the client that IBM surveys their clients at the end of a project because we value their
                    feedback. Inform them they may be contacted to participate in a survey.
