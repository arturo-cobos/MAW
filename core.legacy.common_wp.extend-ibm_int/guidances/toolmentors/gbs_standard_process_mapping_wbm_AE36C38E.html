    1&nbsp;Brief Description
</h3>
<p>
    A unified approach to process management solutions as an offering is necessary for GBS. The first step towards this is
    the development of standards for creating process maps -- a fundamental activity when dealing with processes. Process
    mapping is an essential activity in both internal and external engagements at IBM. However in most cases the exercise
    has been more about:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        documenting a ‘To-Be’ or a future process (often describing a view of the world after the implementation of
        software solution such as an ERP package)
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    and less about:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        creating a shared understanding of an existing process
    </li>
    <li>
        defining a common vision; and establishing traceability of processes, tasks and activities through to an
        organisation’s strategic goals
    </li>
    <li>
        identifying and quantifying gaps and areas for improvement
    </li>
    <li>
        developing process performance measurement and monitoring capabilities
    </li>
    <li>
        educating the participants in a process.
    </li>
</ul>As a result we continue to miss opportunities for delivering optimal value to the client and incremental revenue by
delivering incremental improvements to ‘As-is’ processes. Further still, since there are few standards or conventions,
knowledge capture may be difficult and valuable intellectual property (IP) is rarely reused. At best, process maps end up
as engagement deliverables in <i>KnowledgeView</i> (for GBS) or a team database. 
<p>
    Historically, IBM practitioners have documented processes using a variety of mapping notations and drawing tools (e.g.
    MS Visio, MS PowerPoint, MS Word, WBI Workbench, ID Scheer’s ARIS, Sterling Software’s CABE, Lotus Freelance). As a
    result, mapping conventions have been developed specific to the activities being documented or based on project
    directives, as well as being influenced by individual preferences. As an organization we need to consolidate the number
    of different process mapping techniques in use across IBM into one coherent organization-wide approach. This will allow
    process maps to be reused and “straw man” processes and benchmarks to be developed to reduce start-up and delivery
    effort.
</p>IBM’s vision is to provide practitioners a standard, integrated asset base and associated tools which accelerate
business process transformation for clients by defining what is best in class by service or industry.

<h3>
    2&nbsp;Usage Context
</h3>
<p>
    This technique paper is for IBM GBS practitioners engaged in process mapping activities, regardless of their industry
    sector or line of service, and independent of any engagement methodology. It is assumed that readers have a basic
    understanding of the principles and application of process mapping.
</p>
<p>
    Other potential users of this guide include: system analysts and IT architects (who will transform business
    requirements into technical specification) and project managers who need to appreciate the rigours of process mapping.

<br />
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Key Considerations
</h3>
<p>
    It is assumed that the practitioner has a basic understanding of the principles of mapping processes, as well as an
    appreciation of the use of WebSphere Business Modeler version 6 (including familiarity with process constructs).
