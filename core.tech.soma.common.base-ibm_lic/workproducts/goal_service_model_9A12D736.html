    The Goal-Service Model work product provides value in several areas by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identifying candidate services for an SOA-based solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing service exposure decision criteria that can be applied to candidate services during service specification
    </li>
    <li>
        Clarifying the scope of other service identification activities
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Goal-Service modeling analyzes and documents high level business goals and sub-goals, along with related Key
    Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics, in order to identify and validate candidate services proposed for use in an
    SOA based solution.&nbsp; This approach provides traceability from a service back to goals of an enterprise, an
    important criterion for determining the suitability of a candidate service.&nbsp; The Goal-Service Model work product
    captures the results of Goal-Service Modeling, one of three major techniques used during Service-Oriented Modeling and
    Architecture (SOMA) identification activities.&nbsp; By clarifying business goals related to the SOA based initiative,
    Goal-Service Modeling provides scoping criteria for the other two SOMA identification activities.&nbsp;

    The Goal-Service Model work product captures the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        High level business goals
    </li>
    <li>
        Sub-goals decomposed from the high level business goals
    </li>
    <li>
        Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) associated with each goal and sub-goal
    </li>
    <li>
        Metrics associated with each KPI that can be used to identify what measurements need to be captured and analyzed to
        assess whether goals are being met
    </li>
    <li>
        Services that support the goals
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Business goals describe specific things that are important for the business to achieve. High level goals can be
    decomposed into sub-goals that become increasingly narrower in scope and definition.
</p>
<p>
    Once an enterprise has analyzed its mission and defined its goals, it needs a way to measure progress toward those
    goals. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), also known as Key Success Indicators (KSIs) or Key Business Indicators
    (KBIs), are used by businesses to define and measure progress toward their goals. In SOMA, KPIs represent quantifiable
    objectives, agreed to when the goal is established, that reflect the critical success factors of an organization.<br />
    <br />
    KPIs differ depending on an industry and an organization. A sales organization may have as one of their KPIs the
    percentage of its sales that comes from return customers. A Customer Service Organization may have a KPI that measures
    a number of customer calls answered in under a minute. To determine if the objectives associated with a KPI are being
    met, the KPI may need to be broken down into one or more metrics, which identify specific measurements to collect for
    analysis (e.g. time to close an average sale deal).KPIs are associated with each goal and sub-goal to enable us to
    measure our success in achieving the goal.

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Notation</th><td class="sectionTableCell">The Goal Service Model artifact takes the form of a matrix with a hierarchy of numbered goals in rows and the following
columns: 
<p>
    <strong><u>Goal:</u></strong> Organizations define goals to meet their mission and to set strategic direction.&nbsp; In
    SOMA, the term goal denotes a business aspiration starting at a high level.&nbsp; For example a high level goal could
    be to increase revenue.&nbsp; This goal can be decomposed into sub-goals such as “increase revenue from &lt;x&gt;”, and
    “increase revenue from &lt;y&gt;”.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Key Performance Indicator (KPI):</u></strong> KPIs are used to determine how well a business is meeting its
    goals, or to assess the level of performance of business processes.&nbsp; For example, for the goal “increase revenue”,
    a specific KPI could be “increase revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year”.&nbsp; This provides a specific way to
    determine if the goal has been met.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Metrics:</u></strong> Metrics identify the type of measurements that need to be collected to assess the
    state of the KPIs.&nbsp; For a KPI such as “increase revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year”, a metric could be
    “record the revenue from all revenue generating transactions”.&nbsp; Measurements would then need to be taken of each
    relevant transaction, across all systems that support those transactions.&nbsp; An implication of this is that all of
    the individual measurements dictated by the metric would need to be aggregated and reported in a meaningful way so that
    it can be determined if the related KPI has been met.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Service:</u></strong> a (candidate) service that can be used to meet the goal or sub-goal.&nbsp; This
    reflects a mapping between goals (or sub-goals) and services in the service portfolio of the Service Model work
    product. Initially the service mapping will be based on candidate services.&nbsp; Later as specific service exposure
    decisions are made, candidate services can become services chosen for exposure.&nbsp; Service exposure decisions are
    recorded in the Service Model work product.<br />

    This information is typically completed to two levels of elaboration.&nbsp; The first elaboration should be as complete
    as possible in terms of identifying goals, sub-goals, KPIs and metrics.&nbsp; The mapping of goals and sub-goals to
    services should be made as complete as feasible at this point in the process, but the validation and completion of this
    mapping is actually finalized during SOMA Service Exposure Decisions, resulting in the second elaboration of this work
    product.
</p>
<p>
    Each goal and sub-goal should have a KPI and Metric associated with it.&nbsp; Although an objective of Goal-Service
    Modeling is to map goals to services, high level goals may not map directly to a service – sub-goals tend to map more
    obviously to services.&nbsp; When a service maps explicitly to a sub-goal it is also mapping implicitly to a higher
    level goal.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    A single instance of the Goal-Service Model should be created to cover all business domain within the scope of the
    project.&nbsp; Given that subject matter experts may be experts in a specific business domain, an iterative approach
    can be used to focus on one domain at a time to make interviews or work sessions more efficient.
</p>
<p>
    During Goal-Service Modeling interview or work sessions, consider the knowledge areas that the subject matter experts
    can speak to.&nbsp; For example, it may be possible to capture some initial statements of non-functional requirements
    in parallel with this task.&nbsp; This can provide valuable input into other more detailed requirements gathering
    sessions.

    Failure to clearly define business goals will make it difficult to determine if proposed candidate services are
    business-aligned and appropriate for use in an SOA based initiative. Since Goal-Service Modeling can also identify (not
    simply validate) candidate services, failure to create this work product could lead to gaps in the service portfolio.
    These factors could result in additional effort and cost due to the creation of unnecessary services, or reduced
    success of the SOA based solution due to gaps in the service portfolio.
</p>
<p>
    Since the Goal-Service Model is important to defining the scope of other service identification activities, failure to
    create it could result in unnecessary effort being spent in other activities, or gaps in the output from those
    activities.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Although the Goal-Service Model is considered important, if not essential, for a majority of SOA based initiatives,
    there could be occasional circumstances where the focus is narrowed to the creation of services for common technology
    functions which may not appear to be easily aligned with specific business goals. It is worth considering that even in
    these scenarios the Goal-Service Model can be used to document goals related to the “Business of IT”.
