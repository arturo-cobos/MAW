    <strong>Service Orientation</strong> (SO) is a paradigm and has set of values and principles. Core values are business
    value&nbsp;over technical strategy, strategic goals&nbsp;over project-specific benefits intrinsic
    interoperability&nbsp;over custom integration, shared services&nbsp;over specific-purpose implementations,
    flexibility&nbsp;over optimization, and evolutionary refinement over pursuit of initial perfection. See detail at <a href="http://www.soa-manifesto.org/" target="_blank">SOA Manifesto</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Where as, <strong>Service Oriented Architecture</strong> (SOA) is an architectural style that enables the service
    orientation paradigm and associated principles. It is a way of building software; a way of constructing the foundations
    of how you construct software within your organization, or how your clients construct software within their
    organization. An SOA is an enterprise-scale IT architecture, meaning that it provides a set of artifacts that should be
    maintained and governed and considered to be enterprise-level assets. Now, whether they are used at a simple project
    level or a line-of-business level or used in the interactions between business partners—whatever scale and scope they
    are used in—still they need to be funded, maintained, and governed, and they should be considered as enterprise assets.
    That is why we talk of SOA as an enterprise-scale IT architecture. Now, it is an enterprise-scale IT architecture, but
    it is a special one in which we are able to invoke and link resources on demand. When we need a resource, when we need
    some functionality, wherever that functionality is, if it is on the same machine, if it is on another machine that a
    business partner has across the world over the Internet, you can access that information using a service call; one
    implementation of an SOA is Web Services; Web Services is the most prevalent way to implement services at this point of
    time. Remember that SOA is the general case, and Web services are a special implementation of SOA. So you could
    implement SOA in multiple ways and shapes and forms. These resources that can be invoked and linked on demand are
    represented typically as business-aligned capabilities or services which can participate and be composed into
    applications. So these services or business capabilities can be choreographed in a workflow, and that is essentially
    what your application would constitute. These applications can participate and engage at various levels of scope. It
    can be an application at the value-net, at the value chain level, at the enterprise level, a line of business, or
    indeed a small project. They are all geared towards fulfilling business needs. And the primary structuring element of
    SOA-based applications is the service, not the object, not the component, not the subsystem or system, but the service.
</p>
<p>
    In brief,&nbsp;a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an enterprise-scale IT architecture to invoke and link
    resources as needed (on demand):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        These resources are represented as business aligned services, which can participate and be composed into
        applications participating in many levels of scope: a value-net, enterprise, or line of business to fulfill
        business needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        The primary structuring element of SOA-based applications is the service, which is a business capability accessible
        through a specific architectural style, as opposed to subsystems, systems, or components.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    And where a <strong>Service</strong> is defined as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>From business perspective</strong>: A service is a well defined, encapsulated, and business-aligned
        capability.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>From IT perspective</strong>: A service is a discoverable, invokable software resource having a service
        description / interface, and configurable using policies. The service description is available for searching,
        binding, and invocation by a service consumer. The service description implementation is realized through a service
        provider who delivers quality of service requirements for the service consumer.
