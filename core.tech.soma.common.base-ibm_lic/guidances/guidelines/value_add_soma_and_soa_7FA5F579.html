    Much of the value of SOMA and SOA comes from its features, which can and should be applied to business-as-usual
    implementations because:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It provides direct traceability of functionality or capabilities to the business goals. Thus the business knows
        where it is spending its money and verifies that the actual end product that is produced for it, where it was
        spending his money, is well-suited to its organizational goals and objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a combination of multiple techniques for the definition of those services or those business capabilities.
        One technique is not enough. You need a combination. You cast a wide net and catch, so to speak, all of the
        necessary bits of functionality that are increasingly important for your business.
    </li>
    <li>
        Consideration of business architecture, organizational structure, and software development governance in portfolio
        structuring is necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        You also need an iterative and incremental approach that also provides the necessary decoupling of the provider
        from the consumer or the originator of the request.
    </li>
    <li>
        You also need a fractal model of software development, something that is not only iterative and incremental and
        well-encapsulated, in terms of the approach of decoupling the provider from the consumer, but that you can apply
        these principles recursively in a self-similar manner to any kind of scope, whether it is across a value chain or a
        small project.
    </li>
    <li>
        A comprehensive set of proven capability patterns are defined in SOMA a set of techniques that are important,
        regardless of the type of project you are doing.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Furthermore, the second main point here is that the key principles of service orientation, such as business relevance,
    flexibility, decoupling, reuse, and so on, should apply, regardless of your choice of implementation technology. If you
    are not using Web services and are implementing a COBOL application, the same set of principles are just good software
    engineering principles that should be applied regardless.
</p>
<p>
    And Service-Orientation is the latest and greatest in the evolution of software engineering, and therefore, we are
    merely applying the latest and greatest here. Today, typically, application development projects include integration to
    legacy and packaged application, in addition to custom application development. So we are getting hybrid kinds of
    solutions, and therefore, instead of using multiple methods, we can use one method that supports legacy, packaged,
    custom, composite, governance, integration, data, information, all of these kinds of approaches to SOA, and approaches
    to architecture, and application development can be leveraged and utilized.&nbsp;
