<h4>
    The Story
</h4>John is a partner in a consulting firm, and his firm buys hardware and software from greatname.biz because of their
superior service and efficient online commerce applications. John and his associates rely on the Internet for e-commerce,
research, and communication with their clients John’s company relies on one of greatname.biz’s partners to provide their
Internet connection service. The company issues each employee a PDA for e-mail, calendars, and address books. Their PDAs
are equipped with modems so that they can keep connected without having to carry laptop computers around. 
<h4>
    Objective
</h4>Get his new computer, from greatname.biz connected to the Internet. 
<h4>
    Getting it out of the box
</h4>John has just received a new computer from greatname.biz. He has taken it out of the box and connected all of the
peripherals. His next step is to install the Internet Service Provider’s software on the computer so that he can connect to
the Internet and begin some research. However, he is having trouble with the ISP’s software. 
<h4>
    Bright Idea
</h4>John is a very experienced computer user, and knows that with the Windows Dialer and Internet Explorer already
installed on his computer, he won’t need his ISP’s software. He will configure them himself, and be online soon. As he is
using the Windows troubleshooting software to set up the dialer, he finds out that he just needs some information about the
TCP/IP configuration. Like many confident people with years of experience using computers, John would rather go online to
get the information that he needs rather than calling the customer support line. 
<h4>
    The PDA Interface
</h4>Because John is a big fan of his PDA, he regularly uses it for his e-mail and to connect to the Internet. He also uses
his PDA to make online reservations. Often, he has even used it to visit the greatname.biz Web site to make impulse buys.
John connects to greatname.biz and uses the online help to get the TCP/IP settings he needs to set up his Windows dialer. 
<h4>
    The Solution
</h4>John logs on to the site using his personalized settings. His profile contains information about the company’s
standard hardware, software and ISP configurations. When he writes “How do I connect to the Internet?” at the natural
language search prompt on his PDA, he is quickly taken to an area of the site that will walk him through the process of
connecting his computer to the Internet. <br />
Each screen on the PDA interface helps him complete a step in the process, much like the Windows troubleshooter, but the
Web site is able to take him a step further than Windows. It knows his hardware configuration, the software that he has
pre-installed on his computer and the TCP/IP settings that he should use. If all else fails, the Web site will connect him
with a customer service representative. However, that’s not necessary this time, because with the help of the Web site,
John is able to get up and running on the Internet in a few minutes.
