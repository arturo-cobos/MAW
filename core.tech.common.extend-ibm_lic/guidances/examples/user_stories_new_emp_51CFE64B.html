<h5>
    The Story
</h5>Jane owns a small accounting business with three employees. She has just won a big new account and has hired a new
employee to help her company with the additional workload. She has a personalized account at greatname.biz and uses the
site to collaborate with her employees for business purchases. 
<h5>
    Objective
</h5>Add a new employee to her company’s e-profile and get a new Office in a Box for him. 
<h5>
    Logging in
</h5>Jane goes to greatname.biz and logs in to her personalized Office in a Box. When her personalized space appears, there
is a message for her reminding her of the monthly supplies that she usually buys. Included in the message is a notification
of the latest release of her tax preparation software. She is given options to add this upgrade to her supply order and to
compare this new release to other tax software on the market. 
<h5>
    Comparison
</h5>She clicks on the comparison button, bringing up a new window with tax preparation software sorted by price. She
clicks on the sort by profession, listing the programs by their suitability for professional tax preparers. These
comparisons confirm her choice. She closes the comparison window, and clicks on the upgrade button. The site informs her
that she will need to upgrade her standard systems with an additional 32 megabytes of RAM to make the new software work
efficiently. This is fine with her, so she clicks OK. 
<h5>
    PricePad
</h5>Jane quickly reviews her supply list, and clicks on buy. The PricePad appears on her screen with the supplies, four
upgrades for her company’s tax software, and the additional memory for her computers. 
<h5>
    e-Profile
</h5>Next, Jane brings up her company’s e-profile, by choosing that button on her personalized page. The profile page
contains a list of her most recent purchases at greatname.biz and several configuration options. She clicks on “add new
users,” and types in information for her new employee. She assigns privileges and restrictions to the user’s account. When
she is finished, the site asks if the new employee will need a new Office in a Box. Jane clicks on Yes. 
<h5>
    Configurator
</h5>The configurator comes up with Jane’s standard office system. Since each of her employees works at home, they have a
comprehensive set of office equipment, including their computer. The standard system includes the upgraded tax software and
the additional memory that she has on her price pad. She clicks to add the system to her PricePad, and the ship to address
is prepopulated with the new employee’s information. 
<h5>
    Volume Incentive
</h5>Jane clicks buy on her PricePad, and a detailed invoice appears on her screen. A pop-up window announces that because
of the amount of her purchases that day, she is entitled to a 5% discount and free shipping. Jane clicks continue and buys
all of the items on her PricePad.
