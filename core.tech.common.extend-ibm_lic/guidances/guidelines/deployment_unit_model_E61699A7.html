    Different forces will be involved in the placement process, depending on the type of DU involved. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Presentation DUs must be located at the point of contact with the user.
    </li>
    <li>
        Data DUs may be located so that they generate a minimal amount of data distribution and other systems management
        requirements, or so that they maximise the performance and availability characteristics of the solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Execution DUs may be located close to the data they access, other execution DUs with which they collaborate, or
        close to the user – depending on the network traffic and systems management effects these options may present.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that, if it transpires that all aspects of a component are co-located on the same node, then it is not good
    practice to merge all DUs into one entity, since the non-functional characteristics of a PDU, EDU, and DDU are very
    different, and must be separately handled in the OM development. Equally, if two or more DUs of the same type are
    co-located on one node, great care must be taken when deciding to coalesce (merge) them into one DU.
</p>
<p>
    Since the Deployment Unit Specification and Deployment Unit Model artifacts form the bridge between the functional and
    operational aspects of architecture, it is vital to involve both the Operational and Functional IT Architects when
    developing or modifying them.
</p>
<p>
    <b><font size="4">Defining DU Relationships</font></b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Component to DU Relationships</b>
</p>
<p>
    One convenient way of documenting the results of the Component to DU relationships may be via a matrix, relating the
    list of application components to the DU types, for example:
</p>
<p>
    <img height="266" alt="Component-DU Matrix" src="./../../../core.tech.common.extend-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/component_du_matrix.gif" width="568" />&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <b>Figure 1: Example Component-DU matrix</b>
</p>
<p>
    It must be born in mind, however, that there may be circumstances in which the component/DU mapping cannot be
    represented in a simple matrix such as this, particularly when there is significant component grouping, and the
    component-DU mapping must therefore be documented DU type by DU type.
</p>
<p>
    <b>DU to DU Relationships</b>
</p>
<p>
    The separation into the three different aspects (Presentation, Execution, Data) means that there are additional
    relationships between DU types.
</p>
<p>
    There are four key DU oriented relationships to be understood in order to successfully deploy the DUs on the
    Operational Model:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Presentation to Data deployment units
    </li>
    <li>
        Presentation to Execution deployment units
    </li>
    <li>
        Execution to Data deployment units
    </li>
    <li>
        Execution to Execution deployment units (‘uses/used by’)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is normal to document these relationships via DU – DU matrices, since matrices permit the documentation of
    relationship’s characteristics in the intersecting cells.
</p>
<p>
    As an understanding of these relationships is gained, remember that revisions may be induced in the candidate
    deployment units.
</p>
<p>
    Initially, you may decide to document the relationships between DUs as a simple "Yes/No". However the NFRs of the
    relationship will be important, particularly the Service Level Characteristics of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Performance
    </li>
    <li>
        Availability
    </li>
    <li>
        Security
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These NFRs will be cascaded onto the characteristics of the nodes and connections in the Operational Model.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Presentation to Data DU matrix</b>
</p>
<p>
    This information is of particular value in defining the SCOPE of data DUs across the IT system, which aids in the Data
    DU placement on the Operational Model.
</p>
<p>
    Note that these PDU–DDU relationships do not represent "interactions" between the PDU and DDUs –these must be always be
    achieved by component executions as represented by EDUs. However, the scope and other NFR data captured in this matrix
    provide a very useful insight into the requirements of the solution.
</p>
<p>
    Identify the presentation DUs that are linked in some way to each data deployment unit. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The D_Customer DDU is used by order clerks and accounts receivable clerks via the U_Clerk PDU
    </li>
    <li>
        The D_Document DDU is used by the U_Secretary PDU
    </li>
    <li>
        The D_Program DDU is used by the U_Programmer PDU
    </li>
    <li>
        The D_Performance DDU is used by the U_Systems Monitoring PDU (a system interface)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Many clients have a hierarchical business organization. Thus, at this point you may find useful to identify and
    document the lowest organizational level which contains all the user groups who use a particular data deployment unit.
    Similarly, you may want to document whether a user group from a single or multiple locations uses this data DU.
</p>
<p>
    During this analysis you may discover that the characteristics of a DU-DU relationship are not clear. In these cases it
    probably means the deployment units you had formed earlier were not quite right. Alter them in order to provide an
    unambiguous result in the matrix’s cells.

</p>
<p>
    <b>Figure 2: Example PDU – DDU Characteristics Matrix</b>
</p>
<p>
    This matrix relates the components’ presentation DUs (rows) with their data DUs (columns). Note that in this example,
    only a very minimal amount of information on the relationship is documented.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Presentation to Execution DU matrix</b>
</p>
<p>
    Create a matrix which relates the interfaces used by the end users (ie presentation DUs) to the tasks they perform (as
    represented by the candidate execution DUs).
</p>
<p>
    Note that often many execution DUs do not provide direct support to a user, and therefore not a PDU. However, it is
    quite possible (although not shown in the example here) for two or more EDUs to share a common PDU, as well as one EDU
    to require two or more PDUs (as with E1 in the example)
</p>
<p>
    During this analysis you may discover that the characteristics of a DU-DU relationship are not clear. In these cases it
    probably means the deployment units you had formed earlier were not quite right. Alter them in order to provide an
    unambiguous result in the matrix’s cells.

    This matrix relates the components’ presentation DUs (rows) with their execution DUs (columns). Note that in this

</p>
<p>
    <b>Execution to Execution ("uses/used by") and Execution to Data DU matrices</b>
</p>
<p>
    Both of these DU relationships (EDU-EDU and EDU-DDU) needs to be understood before any viable placement decisions can
    be taken in the development of the Operational Model.
</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    <img height="292" alt="EDU - EDU Characteristics Matrix" src="./../../../core.tech.common.extend-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/edu_edu_characteristics_matrix.gif"     width="568" />&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <b>Figure 4: Example EDU – EDU Characteristics Matrix</b>
</p>
<p>
    Note that in this example, only a very minimal amount of information on the relationship is documented.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the diagonal on this matrix is empty. Given the current level of elaboration (i.e. ahead of any OM
    development activities) this is valid. However, as placement decisions are taken it will be perfectly possible for
    instances of the same EDU to interact (for example if the same EDU is placed in multiple branch offices, and there is a
    requirement for peer-to-peer interactions).
</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    <img height="303" alt="EDU - EDU Characteristics matrix 2" src="./../../../core.tech.common.extend-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/edu_edu_characteristics_matrix2.gif"     width="444" />&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    This matrix relates the components’ execution DUs (rows) with their data DUs (columns). Note that in this example, only
    a very minimal amount of information on the relationship (the "CRUD" relationship) is documented.
</p>
<p>
    Note that, although one specific component (i.e. EDU) controls the access to one or more sets of data (as represented
    by one or more DDUs, this matrix can indicate a relationship with an EDU that does not own the DDU. As with the PDU-DDU
    matrix, this should not therefore be taken to imply any direct interactions between the DUs – rather a specification of
    requirement for access, which may (or may not) be restricted to the owning EDU.
</p>
<p>
    <b><font size="4">Reviewing Candidate DUs and Their Relationships</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Always seek a level of granularity compatible with the needs of the Operational Model’s development. You can always
        refine the DUs (finer or coarser grained) as the development proceeds: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Avoid splitting if an appropriate refinement of NFRs can be negotiated. Just because part of a DU is small
                and stable doe not automatically mean it must be separated from the remaining "volatile" data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid grouping together different sets of requirements at a high level if it creates a "fuzzy" set of
                non-functional requirements for the DU.
            </li>
            <li>
                The objective is to ensure deployment units are sufficiently granular to identify the key potential
                infrastructure differentiation - yet are not too granular to create unnecessary work
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the overall feel of the DUs right? 
        <ul>
            <li>
                If a relationship is not clear - then the deployment units are probably wrong.
            </li>
            <li>
                If everything is related to everything - then the deployment units are probably wrong
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment units in one project are not necessarily the same in another
    </li>
    <li>
        Apply your own experience, judgment and common-sense
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure close co-ordination between the IT Architects responsible for the "components", "deployment units" and
        "nodes", to ensure all needs are accomplished
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Identifing "Hot-spot" DUs and inter-DU relationships</strong>
</p>
<p>
    By now, you will probably have a very large amount of non-functional requirements information associated with the
    solution’s DUs. Moreover, it is probably going to be very difficult or very expensive – or both - to deliver on all of
    these. For example, some performance requirements may not be compatible with some availability or security needs.
</p>
<p>
    So it is important to identify where the "hot spots" are in the DU tables and matrices. What are the functional and
    non-functional requirements that the IT system must deliver?<br />
</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    <img height="259" alt="Hot Spots in a DU-DU Characteristics Matrix" src="./../../../core.tech.common.extend-ibm_lic/guidances/guidelines/resources/hot_spots.gif"     width="573" />&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <b>Figure 5: "Hot spots" in a DU-DU characteristics matrix</b>
</p>
<p>
    As well as identifying these hot spots, it is probably a good idea to rank the requirements defined in the DU tables
    and matrices. You may consider a sequential ranking (in which you identify the top requirements in some order), or you
    might adopt a MoSCoW scheme: "Must", "Should", "Could" and Would."
