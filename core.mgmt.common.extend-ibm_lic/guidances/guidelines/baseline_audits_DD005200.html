    Purpose
</h2>
<p>
    <b>Use this guideline to:</b>
</p>
<p>
    Perform configuration baseline audits including preparing for them, performing them, reporting the results and tracking

    verify their integrity, their completeness and correctness, their compliance with applicable configuration management
    (CM) standards and procedures, and to review the structure and facilities of the project library.
