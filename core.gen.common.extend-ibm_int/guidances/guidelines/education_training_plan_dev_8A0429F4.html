    common approaches to tackle the detail. It is important to identify how the detail will be decided and captured, who
    will be involved in the decision process, and when the detail design must be completed.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">The Education and Training Plan should be produced in association with client members of the team and
    verified by project management and the client sponsor.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">The Education and Training Plan should also be presented to and reviewed by the change implementation
    team. The implementation team must ensure that changes in the implementation are communicated to the training
    development team and that the training plan is coordinated with the rest of the project. Then the training team creates
    the demo and exercise data.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <b>2. Develop Detailed Plans for Each Component of the Education and Training Plan</b>
</p>
<p>
    <u><font size="2">High-Level Curriculum Development</font></u>
</p>
<p>
    Using the blank curriculum template, the to-be process descriptions, and the roles analysis, take a first cut at
    mapping transactions to roles to courses. The curriculum is organized by course, lesson, and topic and represents the
    workflow of the roles using the new business processes, system tasks and recommended audience. For each of the roles
    and for each type of user within the role (based on: experience, background knowledge, existing skills, etc.) decide on
    the best sequence to deliver education and training on the related topics. The topics to be covered in the curriculum
    should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Education and training specifically tailored to the user tasks and responsibilities
    </li>
    <li>
        Other training which will help the users understand both the technology and the context within which the changes
        are being made e.g. organizational changes, PC literacy, business knowledge
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u>Participant Education and Training Schedule</u>
</p>
<p>
    It is recommended that the client take responsibility for the education and training schedule and that the consultant
    aid in its development. Many companies have existing tools to help create a schedule. Prior to schedule creation, the
    following details must be determined:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What are the constraints?
    </li>
    <li>
        number of classrooms
    </li>
    <li>
        number of instructors
    </li>
    <li>
        number of people per class
    </li>
    <li>
        number of people per department who can be in class at a time
    </li>
    <li>
        departments that can’t attend at the same time
    </li>
    <li>
        desired class length
    </li>
    <li>
        times of day certain classes can’t be held
    </li>
    <li>
        number of classes per course
    </li>
    <li>
        shifts
    </li>
    <li>
        locations
    </li>
    <li>
        vacations
    </li>
    <li>
        make-up classes
    </li>
    <li>
        project plan
    </li>
    <li>
        prerequisites
    </li>
    <li>
        specification and material development plan (often certain courses are ready earlier than others due to
        configuration being completed early)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is likely that the schedule will go through much iteration. After the initial schedule is presented, additional
    conflicts and constraints are sure to arise. To minimize the number of revisions, it is important to determine who will
    sign off on the schedule and how much input management will have in determining the schedule.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Train the Trainer Plan</u>
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned previously, whenever possible, it is recommended that the client deliver the education and training and
    the consultant provide support in an effort to transfer knowledge to the client and make then self-sufficient. The
    client should be asked to identify their instructor resources as early as possible in the project in order to get them
    committed by management and possibly involved in functional testing activities as soon as they are available. (See
    References) The objective is to prepare the instructor-development path and deliver a train-the-trainer program for
    Client identified Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) who will act as classroom instructors in their area of expertise.
</p>
<p>
    To select and train instructors, the following steps should be performed:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            Identify the selection criteria for the instructors and perform the selection.

                    Presentation Techniques - This course is application independent and is strongly recommended to the
                    Client who chooses to enable and train its own resources to deliver the application training to the
                    participants.
                </div>

                    on the practical application of instructional techniques and Adult Learning Principles. It is primarily
                    for new trainers who want to quickly build strong educational skills to assist them in customizing,
                    teaching, and evaluating programs to train adults.

</ol>
<p>
    <u>IT Infrastructure Plan</u>
</p>
<p>
    Training Instance - Based on the training schedule and high level strategy, a more detailed strategy must be designed
    and communicated. The following items should be included in the strategy:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Description of each training client and its purpose
    </li>
    <li>
        Refresh Schedule
    </li>
    <li>
        Data load plan including master data and course specific data
    </li>
    <li>
        Security for participants, developers, and trainers
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Delivery Methods - Depending on the delivery methods and the performance support tools chosen, an IT infrastructure
    plan may be needed that addresses:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        LAN requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Bandwidth
    </li>
    <li>
        WAN requirements
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u>Plan to Deliver Training</u>
</p>
<p>
    Based on the training strategy and the needs assessment, all or some of the training scenarios below will be delivered.
</p>
<p>
    Prerequisite Training - for a user to be successful in functional training, they must be computer literate. Windows
    training is an example of prerequisite training.
</p>
<p>
    Business Process Training - when a company reengineers their business processes, they may decide to conduct training on
    the new processes prior to the functional training.
</p>
<p>
    Pilot - the first teaching of a class. Normally a technical editor, client, process owners, and consultant subject
    matter experts attend and review the class as it is delivered. Updates are made to the course.
</p>
<p>
    Conference Room Pilot - a review of the training materials that consists of reading through the materials together with
    the client and performing a subset of the corresponding exercises.
</p>
<p>
    Navigation Training - used to teach the end user to feel comfortable with the specific software application menu paths
    and selection options, without process or functionality specifics. Navigation training is often delivered with a CBT or
    facilitated CBT.
</p>
<p>
    Functional Training - the actual training on the new system. It teaches end users how to perform their job-related
    tasks in the system.
</p>
<p>
    Case Studies - a description of a process is presented to the end user. This case study provides minimal guidance and
    is used to determine/re-enforce the end users ability to determine which transactions must be completed and to actually
    complete the transactions in a training strategy.
</p>
<p>
    Dress Rehearsals or scenario walkthroughs - a company wide or department wide test of the end user’s logons, security,
    and ability to perform transactions. This exercise is often completed 2 weeks prior to production start and at the end
    of the functional training schedule.
</p>
<p>
    Refresher Training - depending on the elapsed length of time from end users training to production start, exercises or
    short sessions may be provided to the end user to help them maintain their skills.
</p>
<p>
    Remedial Training - some end users may not completely grasp the functional training. A process should be established to
    identify these people and to provide them with additional training or support.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Plan to Evaluate Training</u>
</p>
<p>
    Training evaluation includes both formative and summative evaluations. The formative is done prior to delivery and the
    summative is done during and after delivery. Pilots and conference room pilots are part of the formative evaluation.
    Class evaluations and post-production evaluations make up the summative evaluation.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Plan for Post Change Support</u>
</p>
<p>
    The education and training plan should also include post implementation support and ongoing education and training.
    After cut over, there will be a variety of additional participant needs. First, a help desk may need to be established
    in cases where there are a significant number of participants. Second, performance support tools should be available to
    participants. Third, additional training such as job change, new hire, refresher, and additional skills training may
    need to occur.
</p>
<p>
    Also after cut-over, the summative evaluation is finished and the overall education and training effort is evaluated.
</p>
<p>
    <b>3. Review/Revise the Education and Training Plan (and Strategy)</b>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Based on the detailed education and training plan, it is necessary to review the education and training
    strategy document to validate that the details of the education and training plan reflect the initial intent or to
    change the strategy and explain the need for the change.</font>
