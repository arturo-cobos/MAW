        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    Typically the number of participants in this workshop will be small and may only involve the client Training Manager,
    Change Management Manager, and IBM counterparts. In some cases, it may be beneficial to have the project manager
    participate in all or part of the workshop.
</p><strong>Conduct Initial Strategy Workshop</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    The workshop may take several hours or several days depending on the size of the project and the information readily
    available prior to the workshop for discussion. As with every workshop, it is important to begin the workshop by
    clearly stating the purpose and goals. During the initial meeting it is important to explain that the outcome of this
    process is a high level strategy and corresponding project plan. Throughout the workshop, there will likely be
    philosophical questions/debates, discussions about different approaches, and possibly strong feelings by the client on
    how certain pieces of the strategy should be accomplished.<br />
    It is the consultant’s job to listen to the client’s desires, inform the client about potential solutions, determine
    when there is not enough information to make an educated decision, and receive consensus on an action plan. Below is a
    list of key components in a high level training strategy. The details of these components are determined at a later
    date, but enough information must be gathered on each to make an informed decision on the approach, and to ultimately
    have the client take ownership of the Education and Training Strategy.<br />
    It is important to note that due to additional information received later in the project, it may be necessary to
    revisit, revise, and receive client sign-off on a revised education and training strategy. This is a living
    document.<br />
    At the end of the workshop, it is important to summarize the workshop, determine an action plan for acquiring
    additional information, and establish a timetable for completion.<br />

    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Critical Success Factors</i></b><br />
    In the early stages of the project core success factors for an implementation are identified. These core success
    factors are known as critical success factors. Typically, critical success factors are identified for the overall
    success of the project, but may not be directly related to the success of the education and training initiative.<br />
    The following are examples of different critical success factors for training:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Management of the training program must be integrated with the overall project management
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Start training with a ‘kick off’ to sell the solution and the overall training initiative
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Communicate to end user community of new business processes and application skills that they may be required to
            learn
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Identify key requirements that are typically underestimated
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Participant’s Education and Training Needs</i></b><br />
    Based on the front end analysis (FEA) the roles analysis (if completed), the future system and organization design, and
    any other existing documentation, the training needs of the Participant base should become clearer. Minimally, there
    should be an estimate for the number of people to be trained per functional area and their current skill levels. Also
    known may be the Key Performance Indicators. Based on this information a discussion on prerequisite training,
    functional training, and ongoing training should take place.<br />
    The result of this discussion should be a high level plan that describes the components of the overall training
    experience. For example, it may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            PC skills training
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Windows training
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Process training
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            System Navigation
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Functional education and training
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Remedial education and training
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Post Change education and training
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Education and Training Delivery Strategy</i></b><br />
    The Education and Training Delivery strategy includes the methods of delivery, the resources, the training of those
    resources, and the logistics.<br />
    <b>Methods of Delivery</b><br />
    Based on the participant training needs, a variety of delivery methods may be evaluated. For example, Navigation
    Training may be provided by a CBT while functional training may be ILT. The client may want to pursue Web Based
    Training, Distance Learning, or a variety of delivery methods. Each of these should be discussed and, based on the
    discussion, additional information with regard to IT infrastructure may be needed before an informed decision can be
    made. Clients may initially choose a delivery method that greatly depends on technology and, once they analyze their
    current IT Infrastructure, may decide the cost to support the delivery method does not outweigh the benefit.<br />
    The following are examples of different delivery methods and performance support tools:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Self-paced instruction, such as Computer Based Training (CBT) or self-study
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Classroom instructor-led training (ILT)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Workshops
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Lectures

    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Demonstrations
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            On-the-job training
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Job aids
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            On-line Help
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>

    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Distance Learning

    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Study guides, etc.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Floorwalkers
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Resources</b><br />
    It is important to determine who will developed training documentation and who will deliver the end user training and
    how they will gain the background knowledge to deliver quality training.<br />
    Whenever possible, it is recommended that the client deliver the training and the consultant provide support in an
    effort to transfer knowledge to the client leads and make them self-sufficient. The following items should be discussed
    during the high level strategy:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Resource needs, availability, and skills
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Pros and cons of resource mix
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Train the Trainer (Adult Learning Principals, system knowledge, process knowledge, etc.)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Who will deliver ongoing training?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Logistics</b><br />
    A list of the training locations to be used, their availability, size and equipment must be generated. Internal
    training facilities are often heavily used. The project sponsor may need to become involved to ensure that priority is
    given to the training activities for the change program. External training facilities may need to be identified, but
    these may need specialized equipment installed.<br />
    The logistics decisions should take into account the preferences of the participants. The delivery method should be
    verified as the implementation proceeds, to ensure that the final method chosen is the most appropriate, given the
    capability, content, audience, facilities, time and budget.<br />
    <b><i>IT Infrastructure</i></b><br />
    There are two training related components of the IT Infrastructure. The first relates to the training instance, which
    is the actual box that is used to store master data and transaction data for use in classes. The second is related to
    the delivery methods. To deliver training using CBT, WBT, or Distance Learning, for example, the client must have or be
    willing to invest in adequate IT infrastructure.<br />
    It is recommended that a future workshop be held with the appropriate IBM IT people to perform an analysis as it
    relates to training. Generally, the IT team has prepared for a training instance in its IT assessment, but typically
    has not reviewed the infrastructure from a delivery method capability viewpoint. It may be necessary to work with more
    than one group of IBM consultants to complete the information gathering and analysis.<br />
    Refer to the technique paper in the <i>References</i> section.<br />
    <b><i>Performance Support System (courseware, online help, job aids, etc.)</i></b><br />
    The ultimate goal of the training is to enable the client’s participants to perform their jobs as efficiently as
    possible and, in so doing, meet the established Key Performance Indicators. Performance support includes courseware,
    training, and the tools used to enhance performance, such as on-line help and job aids.<br />
    During this discussion, at a high level, the components of the courseware and the post change support effort should be
    discussed. It may be necessary to gather more information, such as performance support tools currently used by
    participants. Again, the future support tools used are dependent on the capabilities and the skills of the
    participants.<br />
    At this point, a discussion on templates, standards, tools (including platform and versions) and naming conventions to
    be used for developing the different types of training material (including exercise data) and user support material may
    be appropriate.<br />
    <b><i>Education and Training Specification and Material Development Plan</i></b><br />
    Again, at a very high level, the education and training specification and material development plan should be
    discussed. To accurately determine staffing levels, it is necessary to know how much time will be allotted for
    development and how many resources the client will supply.<br />
    During the proposal phase, an estimate of resources was developed. It is important to understand the estimate and the
    assumptions behind the estimate.<br />
    At this point, it may be possible to identify subject matter experts and training team members. A discussion of each
    person’s roles and responsibilities is also suggested.<br />
    <b><i>Document Maintenance Strategy</i></b><br />
    Maintaining the performance support tools after change implementation is a large task and often underestimated. The
    client often wants to push this discussion off and worry about it later. This initial workshop is a great time to
    explain the value of maintaining the courseware, online help, job aids, etc.<br />
    Some of the questions to ask the client in order to stimulate thinking are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            How will you train new hires?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How will you cross train?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How will you train for job changes?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How will you train on new functionality? System Upgrades?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How will you train maturing participants to leverage the system?
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How will you maintain courseware in the case of new functionality or system upgrades?
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    Prior to developing the look and feel of the courseware, the document maintenance strategy should be determined. In
    addition, the client must plan for resources to maintain the documents.<br />
    <b><i>Education and Training Evaluation Strategy</i></b><br />
    Conducting an education and training evaluation can measure education and training specification and material
    development, delivery, and effectiveness. Normally the evaluation strategy is divided into two components, the
    formative evaluation and the summative evaluation. During the Initial Education and Training Strategy workshop, it is
    important to educate the client on the suggested evaluations, their purposes, and how conducting the evaluation will
    benefit the client.<br />
    The formative evaluation is used to improve training course effectiveness and is conducted during courseware
    development. The summative evaluation is conducted after the courses have been delivered and is used to evaluate the
    effectiveness of training.<br />
    <b><i>Post Change Support</i></b><br />
    In this case post change support refers to all of the support mechanisms provided/available to the participant after
    change implementation. Post change support includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Help desk
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Mentoring/floor support
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Performance Support Systems such as on-line help
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Post change training needs
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Cross training
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            New hire/job change
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            New skills
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Document maintenance (planned for above)
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b><i>Training Readiness Strategy</i></b><br />
    In most cases, a communications strategy has been previously planned, but not a training readiness strategy. Training
    readiness is comprised of activities, which communicates the project progress to the participants, as it relates to
    their training. This communication will help prepare them for the actual delivery of training.<br />
    <b><i>Resource Planning and Staffing</i></b><br />
    In preparation for the proposal and statement of work, certain assumptions were made to estimate client-supplied and
    consultant-supplied resources. As more information is gathered, resource needs must be reviewed and plans revised as
    needed. Throughout this workshop, it is important to begin to define roles and responsibilities for the execution of
    the training strategy and to map names to the roles. For example, the client may have decided that they want to use
    their own people to deliver training. In this case, it will be necessary to determine the number of trainers needed,
    instructor criteria, roles and responsibilities, and the resource pool.<br />
    For each component of the training strategy, the resource needs must be established and resource mix (client and/or
    consultant) must be determined. Refer to the <b><i>Resource Planning and Staffing</i></b> document for an overview of
    the pre-proposal resource planning and staffing approach. Throughout the project, resource needs must be continually
    evaluated, as new details are uncovered.
</p><strong>Gather Additional Data/Information</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Based on the Education and Initial Training Strategy Workshop, the consultant, with the help of the client, determined
    additional data needs to aid in making informed decisions with regard to the high level education and training
    strategy. At this point, the action plan is put into motion based on the established time frame. Data is often gathered
    through workshops, interviews, research, and surveys.<br />
    Since the data needed for the IT Infrastructure must be provided by technical people with IT Infrastructure expertise,
    the training consultant should contact the appropriate IBM personnel for assistance. Refer to the supporting document
    in the References section for additional guidance
</p><strong>Prepare High Level Education and Training Strategy or Strategies</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    The IBM consultant, based on the newly collected information, assumptions, and previously gathered information,
    produces a first draft of a proposed training strategy. Included in the strategy are facts, assumptions, risks, and
    recommendations.<br />
    The IBM consultant should compare the strategy to existing, previously researched strategies. In addition, the draft
    should be submitted for internal review by another IBM training consultant. Once the high level strategy has been
    reviewed and revised, a Strategy Review Workshop should be organized and conducted.
</p><strong>Conduct Strategy Review Workshop(s) and Receive Client Sign-off</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    The purpose of the workshop is to gain client approval of the high level strategy. The client must be willing to
    support the strategy and take ownership for its implementation. If multiple strategies have been written, each is
    evaluated. The strategy may need to be revised and reviewed multiple times before the client is willing to sign off on
    the strategy.<br />
    Once sign-off is achieved, it may be necessary to present the strategy to key stakeholders. This high level
    presentation is an excellent way to keep management informed, and to facilitate early client ownership of the process.
    It is highly recommended that the presentation be delivered by the client training manager in an effort to demonstrate
    client support of the high level training strategy.
</p><strong>Prepare/Revise High Level Project Plan</strong> 
<p>
    Once the high level strategy has been agreed upon, the high-level project plan should be revised/created. The project
    plan will serve as the road map to drive the training effort to completion on time and within budget. This initial plan
    eventually turns into a detailed project plan for the entire training effort since it is continuously updated based on
    the latest information.<br />
    The Education and Training Plans should be produced in association with client members of the team and verified by
    project management and the client sponsor. Once agreed upon, the education and training specifications and materials
    can be developed. This uses information from the Education and Training Plan to specify specific training elements.The
    Education and Training Plans should also be presented to and reviewed by the change implementation team. The
    implementation team must ensure that changes in the implementation are communicated to the training development team
    and that the training plan is coordinated with the rest of the project. Then the training team must create the demo and
    exercise data.
