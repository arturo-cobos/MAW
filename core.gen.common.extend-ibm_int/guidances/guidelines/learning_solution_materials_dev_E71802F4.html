    The following are the guidelines for developing Learning Solution materials;
</p>
<p>
    1. Conduct a mapping session.<br />
    2. Determine the delivery method.<br />
    3. Develop and publish a curriculum.<br />
    4. Develop the Materials.

<p>
    5. Create Courseware Materials.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conduct a Mapping Session</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Conduct an mapping session to map the transactions to roles and the roles to courses. It’s best to involve client
    representatives so that the roles are properly described and mapped.
</p><strong>Determine the Delivery Method</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Determine the delivery method/s that best fits the client’s need and capability. For example, there must be web
    connectivitiy available to the students if the training is developed and delivered on the web! The method can vary by
    course. Capture this information and include it in the Learning Solution Materials.
</p><strong>Develop and Publish a Curriculum</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Using the roles that were mapped to courses, develop and publish a curriculum that describes the course content and
    approach. Follow the design captured in the Learning Solution Design document. Verify the curriculum with the client
    even though signoff is not required. That way the client is more involved and there is less chance of developing
    materials that don’t match the work responsibilities.
</p><strong>Develop the Materials</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Develop the help files, quick references, job aids and course materials ensuring that they follow the design outlined
    in the Learning Solution Design document. It is always best if periodic reviews with the client representatives are
    held to make sure the products are on target to fit the need.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Script Learning Solution Draft</b> - Based on the Learning Solution Design, Information Developers create a
            first draft of the learning solution. Typically, the Instructional Designer and/or SME(s) will be available to
            answer any questions that are raised during development.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>QC Review of Draft</b> - Once a draft of the learning solution (or part of the learning solution) has been
            created, the Instructional Designer and at least one Information Editor review the draft. These individuals
            review the draft for the following criteria:
        </div>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Adherence to the approved design
            </li>
            <li>
                Creation of courseware that is instructionally sound (fair and appropriate test items, for example)
            </li>
            <li>
                Adherence to project standards
            </li>
            <li>
                Consistency among the work of different Information Developers
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Client Review of Draft</b> - Once the draft has been through an internal round of QC, the draft will be
            submitted to the client for a review. The client SME will likely participate, as may the client sponsor. Client
            signoff of the draft must be obtained before the draft is moved into production.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Produce Media Elements</b> - After securing approval from the client, any media elements that must be
            created as part of the Learning Solution Materials must be produced. This may include audio, video, graphics,
            photographs, and/or animations, and should only be begun once client approval of the initial draft has been
            granted.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Engineer Learning Solution</b> - When all of the needed elements of the learning solution have been
            produced, the learning solution may be assembled into its final form, whether this be a piece of self-paced
            e-Learning software, or support materials for an instructor-led training session.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Final QC</b> - The Learning Solution Materials are reviewed in preparation for delivery to the client. Once
            again, the following criteria are examined:
        </div>
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Adherence to the approved design
            </li>
            <li>
                Creation of courseware that is instructionally sound (fair and appropriate test items, for example)
            </li>
            <li>
                Adherence to project standards
            </li>
            <li>
                Consistency among the work of different Information Developers
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Test Learning Solution</b> - Once it has passed through a final round of QC and if it is appropriate, the
            learning solution is tested to ensure that it functions properly and as expected. This round of testing
            examines whether the courseware will function in its expected delivery environment, and is critical to the
            success of the project.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <b>Final Client Review</b> - The tested courseware is delivered to the client for a final round of review – all
            client comments are logged, and (if within scope) incorporated into the final deliverable.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul><strong>Create Courseware Materials</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Pull together all the developed materials into training manuals or web-based instructional design and deliver this to
    the client as “Courseware Materials” for signoff.
