<p>
    <strong>Review the Training Strategy and Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Prior to creating the training schedule, the IBM consultant and the client review the detailed training strategy and
    curriculum paying special attention to the training delivery methods, number of classes needed per course, facilities,
    and other constraints.<br />
    If not previously documented, it is important to take the time to gather as many constraints as possible prior to
    creating the first draft of the training schedule. For example, if a client has 10 people in the customer service
    department and no more than 4 people can be gone at time, it is important that the constraint be identified so the
    proper number of classes are scheduled.
</p><strong>Prepare Training Schedule and Logistics</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Determine and document the approval process for the training schedule. It is important that the client’s management
    support the approval process to reduce the number of revisions to the schedule and to increase ownership of training
    delivery.<br />
    The client, with the help of the IBM consultant, prepares a preliminary training schedule. Depending on the size of the
    project, the constraints, and the approval process the training schedule may go through many iterations.<br />
    Based on the training schedule, determine the number of instructors needed. Secure additional resources as needed.
    Effective trainers have specific skills and characteristics. It is beneficial to use the Instructor Qualifications
    document as a guide. (See References)<br />
    Map the trainers to the courses and prepare a back-up plan for unforeseen absences.<br />
    Prepare the training facilities. Refer to the Training Facilities Document as a guide. (See References)<br />
    When the schedule is solidified, notify the participants. During the notification, it would be beneficial to
    communicate expectations/policies such as being on time and committing to the entire class period.
</p><strong>Manage the Training Instance</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    The technical team creates the training instance, normally just prior to courseware development. It is a representative
    subset of the future production environment.
</p><strong>Train the Trainer</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Prior to delivering training, trainers must be identified and trained. They must understand how to train adults, how to
    use the training course materials and tools such as on-line help, and how to perform the system related transactions.
</p><strong>Deliver Training</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Based on the training strategy and the need assessment, all or some of the training scenarios below will be delivered.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Prerequisite Training - for a user to be successful in functional training, they must be computer literate.
            Windows training is an example of prerequisite training.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Business Process Training - when a company reengineers their business processes, they may decide to conduct
            training on the new processes prior to the functional training.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Pilot - the first teaching of a class. Normally a technical editor, client, process owners, and consultant
            subject matter experts attend and review the class as it is delivered. Updates are made to the course.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Conference Room Pilot - a review of the training materials that consists of reading through the materials
            together with the client and performing a subset of the corresponding exercises.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Navigation Training - used to teach the end user to feel comfortable with the specific software application
            menu paths and selection options, without process or functionality specifics. Navigation training is often
            delivered with a Computer Based Training (CBT) or facilitated CBT.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Functional Training - the actual training on the new system. It teaches end users how to perform their
            job-related tasks in the system.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Case Studies - a description of a process is presented to the end user. This case study provides minimal
            guidance and is used to determine/re-enforce the end users ability to determine which transactions must be
            completed and to actually complete the transactions in a training strategy.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Dress Rehearsals - a company wide or department wide test of the end user’s logons, security, and ability to
            perform transactions. This exercise is often completed 2 weeks prior to production start and at the end of the
            functional training schedule.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Refresher Training - depending on the elapsed length of time from end users training to production start,
            exercises or short sessions may be provided to the end user to help them maintain their skills.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Remedial Training - some end users may not completely grasp the functional training. A process should be
            established to identify these people and to provide them with additional training or support.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Evaluate Training and produce final report</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Training material development, delivery, and effectiveness can be measured by conducting a training evaluation.
    Normally the evaluation strategy is divided into two components, the formative evaluation and the summative evaluation.
    During the Initial Training Strategy workshop, it is important to educate the client on the suggested evaluations,
    their purposes, and how conducting the evaluation will benefit the client.<br />
    The formative evaluation is used to improve training course effectiveness and is conducted during courseware
    development. The summative evaluation is conducted after the courses have been delivered and is used to evaluate the
    effectiveness of training.<br />
    Refer to the Training Evaluation Strategy document for detailed information regarding the components of each evaluation
    and the method for conducting the evaluations.<br />
    Class evaluations and post-production evaluations make up the summative evaluation.<br />
