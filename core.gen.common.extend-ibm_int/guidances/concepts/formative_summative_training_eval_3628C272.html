    Development/Purpose
</h4>
<p>
    The consultant will conduct a series of tests to verify that the designed training meets the clients needs. During this
    process, the consultant will work closely with the customer and subject matter experts and a selected sample of the
    targeted audience to identify the efficiency of the designed training courses. There are two different types of
    evaluations needed in this process:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Formative Evaluation - The formative evaluation is conducted during the course development and before the training
        is deployed to the target population
    </li>
    <li>
        Summative Evaluation - The summative evaluation is conducted during and after training deployment and allows the
        client to identify new trends and needs as well as to identify how the training is impacting the user population
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Formative evaluation
</h4>
<p>
    This evaluation is the collection of information during the development of instruction that can be used to improve the
    effectiveness of the courses.
</p>
<p>
    Following the completion of a draft of the instruction, a series of evaluations is conducted to collect data that is
    used to identify how to improve the instruction. The formative evaluation is performed in four phases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Subject matter expert review: The subject matter experts review all the materials for accuracy and approve all of
        the training materials that have been developed for each class.
    </li>
    <li>
        One-to-one evaluation: Several learners who are representative of the user population are selected to review the
        training materials before they are presented to the users in class.
    </li>
    <li>
        Small-group evaluation: A small group of users is assembled to preview the course and make their comments about
        content before the course is taught.
    </li>
    <li>
        Field (pilot) evaluation. A pilot of the entire course is conducted for a final review and evaluation of the course
        before it is distributed to the general user population.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Summative evaluation
</h4>
<p>
    This evaluation is the collection of information related to the effectiveness of a training course after the
    development has been completed and the courses have been delivered.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, this evaluation method provides qualitative and quantitative data to support the training endeavor and allows
    the client to assess training efficiency and effectiveness. The success of a quality strategy depends on the
    availability of pre and post training data. It is necessary to keep in mind that training is only one way to resolve
    performance deficiencies and not always the most effective one. A series of interventions will need to be developed to
    resolve problems based on employee moral, compensation and reward systems, job design, and environmental problems.
</p>
<p>
    The summative evaluation measures training results at four different levels.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Level I: Determine subject satisfaction with the presented material. This evaluation allows the client to know if
        the user understood the information presented, and if she considers that the presented information will be applied
        to her job function. For example, do they think the course met his/her needs? Will you be able to utilize the
        presented information at work?
    </li>
    <li>
        Level II: Determine the information he/she learned. This evaluation allows you to know if the user is ready to
        assume a task and that the knowledge was properly transferred. This evaluation will provide the bases for user
        certification. A certified user is one that has proven to possess the necessary knowledge to perform a task or
        assume a job function. If the training is used as a remedy to a performance gap, a pre test is administered a few
        days before the training session. Some times, a post training test is administered after successful completion of
        the course.
    </li>
    <li>
        Level III: Determine performance change level. This evaluation will not immediately follow the training program. It
        is usually completed after the user had enough time to utilize the learned skills at work. This level of evaluation
        is heavily dependent on management observation and job results (productivity increase, improved quality, etc.) as
        well as on KPI measures. The managers utilize pre and post training KPI readings to identify if there has been a
        significant change.
    </li>
    <li>
        Level IV: Determines the impact of training on the organization. Again, this evaluation is only possible after the
        user has had the opportunity to utilize the learned skills. It is measured in relation of a group or department and
        organizational performance.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Impact of Not Evaluating Training
</h4>
<p>
    Training courses may not be well received by the users. The client may not receive all the benefits the training can
    provide.
</p>
<h4>
    Development Approach
</h4>
<p>
    Using the Front End Analysis (FEA) results and documents, courseware design documents and Key Performance Indicators
    (KPI) information, brainstorm a way to address the pre-delivery (formative) and post-delivery (summative) evaluation
    process. This development approach should be conducted in a workshop environment with the client and the consultants
    during the training strategy and planning phase of the project. The following steps should be used to develop the
    training evaluation approaches for the client.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Read the FEA report. It provides information about the work force and the company as a whole that will help you
        understand how historically they have been measuring performance and their attitude toward training.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the type and frequency of the courses designed. For example, if you are using mainly CBT, you need to
        identify a way to measure training satisfaction and knowledge transfer different than when you are measuring the
        same factors after an instructor-led course.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify areas where training results may be difficult to measure due to the existence of other factors that also
        impact performance. Examples of these factors are work reengineering, new resources added to the department, a new
        compensation package. You need to identify these factors because they also impact performance and training will be
        difficult to use as the sole cause for the improvement/success of the implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Write the evaluation recommendation report outlining how the formative and summative evaluation process will be
        carried out. Keep in mid that the summative evaluation should ultimately link to the KPI reading and not only to
        the Reaction/Learning acquisition (level 1-2) model.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop all necessary forms to support the evaluation process.
    </li>
    <li>
        Present the evaluation strategy document to the client for review and sign off.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct an informal meeting with the IBM and client development team to instruct them on how to use the evaluation
        strategy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have all forms reproduced and ready to be used in the evaluation.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Conduct a formative evaluation before the courses are approved by the client.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This formative evaluation is performed prior to the courses being delivered to the general user population. These
    reviews help to refine the training program and assure that the curriculum addresses the users needs for the pre
    go-live training. This is a four-part process to ensure that all the information in the training classes is as accurate
    as possible and has been approved by all client representatives. The four types of formative evaluation reviews are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Subject Matter Expert review
    </li>
    <li>
        One to One Evaluations
    </li>
    <li>
        Small Group Evaluations
    </li>
    <li>
        Pilot Training
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following describes how to conduct each type of formative evaluation, including how to set up the evaluation, who
    to include, the process followed in each review, and the types of results that are to be noted from each review.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u><font size="2">Subject Matter Expert (SME) Review</font></u></b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Submit training material for SME Review. The number of subject matter experts you should approach for assistance
        will vary with the complexity of the information and skills covered in your materials. The nature of the teaching
        task will dictate the number and type of expert consultants you will need. As a general rule, you should consult a
        technical subject matter expert and a person familiar with the organization processes and procedures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide the SME with a description of the course objectives and audience.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include all instructor and learner guides as well as a description of the case scenarios and practice exercises
        that will be used to support the instruction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide the SME with a sign off sheet to collect feedback and authorization to continue the evaluation process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><u><font size="2">One to One Evaluations</font></u></b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Consider the types of information you are looking for in the one-to-one evaluation. They include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Errors in judgement about entry behavior of learners in the target population
            </li>
            <li>
                Faulty instructional analysis
            </li>
            <li>
                Faulty wording or unclear passages
            </li>
            <li>
                Inadequate information presentation
            </li>
            <li>
                Unclear examples
            </li>
            <li>
                Example, flows or diagrams that are too abstract
            </li>
            <li>
                Too much or too little information at one time
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrong sequence of information presented
            </li>
            <li>
                Unclear quiz questions, quiz situations, or quiz directions
            </li>
            <li>
                Unclear or inappropriate objectives and expected outcomes
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The IBM consultant and the client’s trainer conduct the one-to-one evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare yourself to facilitate the event. The trainer will take note and observe the interaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select only learners that are typical to those you believe will be found in the target population. Be sure that the
        selected learners meet the required characteristics before they are brought into the room for evaluation. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Can she read the directions?
            </li>
            <li>
                Does she understand the problem?
            </li>
            <li>
                Does she have the required prerequisite skills?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Arrange for the learners to participate. Explain to the learners that the objective of this exercise is to verify
        that the designed training will be appropriate to the client’s user base.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss the process of a one-to-one formative evaluation of the materials with the future instructor and then
        individually with each learners.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sit with the each learner while she goes through the material.
    </li>
    <li>
        Instruct the learner to write on the material to indicate where difficulty is encountered and to discuss ideas and
        problems.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the learner fails to understand a step, example or explanation, try another verbal example or further explain
        the concept. Does this clarify the issue? Note in writing the changes and suggestions you are planning to make as
        the learner goes through the materials.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the learner appears bored or confused while going through the material, you may want to change the presentation
        to include larger or smaller bits of information before practice and feedback. Record your ideas concerning the
        regrouping of materials as you go alone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep notes on examples, illustrations, and information you add, and changes in sequence during the evaluation
        process. Otherwise, you may forget an important decision or idea. Note taking should be quick and in rough form so
        the learner is not distracted from the materials.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat the one-to-one evaluation with another learner to validate that the required changes are really necessary.
        If errors pointed out by your learner "consultant" are obvious, you may want to make revisions before testing the
        next learner, both to save testing time and to enable the next learner to concentrate on other problems that may
        exist in the materials.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct a performance-context formative evaluation with the subjects used for the one-to-one evaluation. This makes
        more sense when you are designing post-implementation training and the users already have access to the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        In all cases, determine if it is appropriate and feasible to contact learners after they completed the one-to-one
        evaluation. If so, by phone or in person, determine if learners use or found usable the skills learned and how they
        are using it (or planning to use them).
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the level of support required to perform the task alone in the work environment (you can ask the learner
        or talk to their managers).
    </li>
    <li>
        Observe learners as they use skills or interview other users/managers or subordinates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine whether using the skills resolved the performance problem (or may impact the skills requirement)
        identified through the needs assessment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask for suggestions for revisions to the instructions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u><strong>Small group evaluation</strong></u>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify a group of learners that typifies your target population.
    </li>
    <li>
        Arrange for a group to participate in the evaluation (between 8 and twenty)
    </li>
    <li>
        Arrange and allow the required time to fully complete the course
    </li>
    <li>
        Motivate the learners to participate by explaining the importance of the exercise.
    </li>
    <li>
        Carefully select learners that represent the type of people expected in the target population.
    </li>
    <li>
        During the evaluation, make notes about suggestions for instructors who will use the material or about changes you
        want to make in the instruction or procedures as a result of your observation of learners interacting with the
        materials
    </li>
    <li>
        Administer the instructional materials as the course is planned to be taught. Have the instructional settings as
        close to reality as possible with all required equipment and materials present. Any instructional assistance
        required should also be available during the trial. Be sure the future trainer is observing the event, following
        the materials (instructor guide) and is taking notes about suggestions and possible questions she/he may have.
    </li>
    <li>
        Instruct learners that you will need their help in evaluating the materials and to circle or highlight any unclear
        word in the materials.
    </li>
    <li>
        Record the time required for the learners to complete the course. Time required may be more than expected if the
        learners need additional instruction on unfamiliar equipment or procedure.
    </li>
    <li>
        Administer an attitude questionnaire to learners.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss the learning event with the learners and include the client’s trainer in the discussion. Use facilitation
        guide for this purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
        Incorporate feedback and changes to the training courses and submit the final course for the client’s future
        trainer approval.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u><strong>Pilot training</strong></u>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Select appropriate sample from the target population (no more than 25 learners or as many as the clients’ class
        will hold). Be sure to include an accurate sample of the target population.
    </li>
    <li>
        Distribute the instructional materials and the instructor guide to the trainer conducting the session.
    </li>
    <li>
        Personally pay a minimal role in the field trial. Sit in the back of the room and observe the event. Take note of
        any changes or recommendations to the trainer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct follow-up evaluation or phone interview with some of the participating learners.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss required changes/suggestions with the trainer and obtain a sign off on the changes before incorporating
        them into the materials.
    </li>
    <li>
        Incorporate any required changes to the courses.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Conduct Summative Evaluation
</h4>
<p>
    Summative evaluations take place when the courses are being delivered to the final user population and continue beyond
    production start. As stated before, there are four types of summative evaluations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Level I: Determines the subject satisfaction with the presented material
    </li>
    <li>
        Level II: Determines the information he/she learned&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Level III: Determines the performance change level
    </li>
    <li>
        Level IV: Determines the impact of training on the organization.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each of the four types of summative evaluations is discussed below including when to actually perform the evaluation
    and how to compile the results.
</p>
<p>
    <u><strong>Level I</strong></u>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Distribute Level 1 reaction evaluation after the course has been delivered. Allow the user 10 minutes to complete
        the form. Try to collect all forms before they leave the room or try to get a verbal commitment that the forms will
        be sent to the instructor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compile the level 1 evaluation results. At the end of the course, summarize the feedback received from the
        participants and keep observations logged for later use. This information is the base for course redesign and
        modifications.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><u><font size="2">Level II</font></u></b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A week after the training took place (or the first week after the system went live), distribute the Level 2
        learning acquisition evaluation to the trained users.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compile Level 2 learning evaluation results and log them on the retraining needs database or spreadsheet. This
        database will allow you to identify the users that need remedial training or for which a retraining session is
        immediately required.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop learning results reports and present it to the client for approval. You can tie this deliverable with a
        post implementation proposal.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><u><font size="2">Level III</font></u></b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Measure Level 3 performance results. Use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to take a reading of the effects of
        training in the trainees’ performance. Be careful to isolate the KPIs that will mainly receive influence from the
        training strategy. If there are other factors be sure to make a list of them and present them as contributing
        factors.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop Level 3 evaluation report. The Level 3 evaluation report lists all defined KPIs and the reading taken
        before and after the training was delivered, as well as contributing factors that may have also influenced KPI
        change. The KPI reading must be greater than the original reading for results to be available at this point. If
        reading falls below original readings try to identify performance gaps and recommend a needs assessment to identify
        the causes for the deficiency and confirm that training was not effective.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b><u><font size="2">Level IV</font></u></b>

    <li>
        Design Level 4 results evaluation. This evaluation will take place after the system has been in use for a
        considerable length of time (usually more than 6 months). The client is responsible for implementing this
        evaluation. In the report include the following:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identified KPI for each role/function defined.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Initial reading taken when the KPI strategy was implemented.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                KPI reading when level 3 - performance evaluation was taken.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Proposed action to conduct a level 4 evaluation.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Recommended timetable and frequency of the reading.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Expected results and possible solutions when deviation is significant.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In this evaluation you need to use the valid readings defined when the KPI strategy was performed. The proposed action
    is just a list of interventions to resolve performance deficiencies. This part of the report can be linked to a
    post-implementation performance support strategy.
