    Develop a build strategy to be used by development to construct system components (builds), which are compatible with
    the function priorities and with the project delivery schedule, taking into account the incremental testing
    opportunities, which can result.
</p>
<p>
    A set of testing plans will include the high level list of items for which testing is needed to be performed. These are
    the lists of business functions and structural functions that will be covered by testing activities. You may consider
    that these are testing blueprints and use them in the way that architects use blueprints as plans to guide them in
    their design and construction processes. The blueprints are not like resource and schedule plans - they serve very
    different purposes. Blueprints are more like a functional road map for building test cases. Both of these types of
    plans will exist on a development project, and both will share dependencies.<br />
    <br />
    The build strategy is the approach to how the physical system components will be built, assembled and tested. A build
    strategy is driven by overall project requirements such as user priorities, development schedules, earlier delivery of
    specific functions, resource constraints or any factor where there is a need to consider building the system in small
    pieces. Each build can be assembled and tested as a stand-alone unit although there may be dependencies on previous
    builds.

<td>The subject of test data can be very complex and is specific to each individual project, necessitating the preparation and
documentation of a detailed strategy.<br />
<br />
The data strategy for a project is a fundamental component of the Master Test Plan (MTP). Depending upon the size and
complexity of the project, the data strategy may either be a sub section within the MTP document, or a separate strategy
document, which is cross-referenced within the project MTP.<br />
<br />
Test data needs to fulfill the requirements of business users, service delivery and systems development staff. <br />
<br />
<b>Key characteristics for test data are as follows:</b> 
<ul>
    <li>
        Functional accuracy - supporting the required business test process requirements, to include: 
        <ul>

                Positive functional testing, i.e. results meet design/business requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Negative functional testing, e.g. error recovery routines.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continuity of processing.
            </li>

    <b>Test Data Management</b><br />
    <br />
    Test Data Management deals with requirements relating to the creation, sampling and storage of test data.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Support for test data preparation
    </li>
</ul>It should be possible to create, amend, display, print, replicate and delete test data for unit testing without
recourse to the application under test. Using an editor and then using batch jobs to load the test data into test
environment files and databases should create test data for unit testing.<br />
<br />
Files of test data loaded this way can contain descriptive comments relating it to documented test conditions and cases.
The comment is stripped out when the data is loaded into the test environment. It is important, where possible; to support
annotation of test data as it allows testers to find particular data and to understand why each record is present in the
test bed. The aim is to ensure that tests are reusable by making them understandable to testers who may not have used them
before.<br />
<br />
Once a capture/replay tool is available the technique should be extended to testing on-line transactions by writing
procedures to enable the capture/replay tool to read files of test data and apply them to the application's user interface.

<ul>
    <li>
        Support for randomization and sampling of production data
    </li>
</ul>Software should be written to randomize personal information contained within test files and databases. This is needed
to ensure that personal information cannot be obtained from test data and makes production data available as a legitimate
source of test data. Note: There is data protection legislation concerning the accuracy, use and availability of personal
data that effectively makes its use as test data unlawful. For this reason test data containing personal data must be
scrambled so as to conceal the identity of the people to whom it originally related.<br />
<br />
Software should be written to copy a specified number of data records matching specified criteria from one file into a
similar file. If necessary the software should be further refined to ensure that referential integrity is maintained within
the test data sub-sets. The data extraction method should ensure that at least one instance of every condition present in
production should be represented in the extract. To do this is necessary to have performed domain analysis so as to define
the set of test conditions for which examples are to be extracted. Domain analysis is, in any case, the first step in
defining the test condition inventory and is a prerequisite to common testing techniques such as equivalence partitioning
and boundary value analysis. A spin-off benefit is that the extraction process will identify invalid data values in
production files. This technique will ensure that a representative sample of production data is available for system and
acceptance testing. <br />
<br />
The data can then be enriched using application software or otherwise to add any test conditions that did not occur
‘naturally’ in production. 
<ul>
    <li>
        Provision of procedures for storage, retrieval and cataloguing of test data
    </li>
</ul>A considerable investment of time, effort and money may be made in the creation of test data. It is absolutely
essential that this investment be not lost by failing to take a secure copy of the test data or by recreating the test
unnecessarily every time a test is run. Likewise, previously achieved results should be treated as a valuable asset as they
can provide a benchmark against which test results can be compared.<br />
<br />
There should be procedures to copy test data to systematically named back ups held on low cost storage media and to
maintain a catalogue of the data stored. There should be similar procedures to restore specified data to the test
environment. These procedures should be developed and controlled by a central testing support function.</td>

<td>When these procedures are available at the project level, they should be used as much as possible. If required these

<br />
Typically, progress tracking and status reporting procedures are developed specifically for the testing project.
Communication within the test project is a critical success factor for the project outcome. Ensure that regular status
meetings and other communication related tasks are included in the test project plan. The guideline on Test Management
Procedures provides a lot of guidance on how to set up these procedures and how to run the status meetings. <br />
<br />
The reporting management system consists of a series of regular meetings involving representatives from all the key
participant teams with the intention of ensuring that the interlocked plan objectives are achieved according to
schedule.<br />
<br />
On large projects, during the testing execution phases, daily operations meetings will be required, to monitor and set
direction/prioritization on the progress of the testing activities and phases, and the project defect report status.</td>
