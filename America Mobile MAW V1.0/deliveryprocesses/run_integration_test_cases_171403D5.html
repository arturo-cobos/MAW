condition of the Integration Test data and environment before, at specified points during, and after, the Integration Test
execution, as well as any unexpected or unscripted events. This will be used to diagnose the variances in the next task.

    The actual Integration Test results are compared to the expected results and any variances identified and recorded.
    This may be done manually or with a variety of test automation tools. The critical success factor is being able to link
    variances with enough details of the Integration Test run which produced them to allow diagnosis of the cause in the
    next task. The test execution control sheet is used to show whether a particular condition, scenario or cycle has been
    successfully tested and to document any variances. This includes confirmation against technical specifications under
    test, such as performance and capacity measurements. All discrepancies, however minor, are recorded and require
    resolution or explanation. The test executor should not dismiss any difference as unimportant. Refer to Defect
    Management for raising defects, test reporting and root cause analysis.<br />
    <br />
    Test Execution Plan contains the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Integration Test Cycle
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration Test Scenario
    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
        Notes (to assist analysis)
    </li>
    <li>
        Defect reference number
    </li>
</ul>It is structured so that all relevant details of a discrepancy can be captured at the time of detection. Control
sheets are not usually required formally as a final deliverable but are used during execution. As each detailed test
condition is satisfied, i.e., no unexplained and unacceptable variances are present, it is signed-off and dated by the test
executor.</td>

<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td>The variances identified from checking results are analyzed to determine their cause. Analysis of the variance may indicate
the cause of the problem to be a defect or may result in a change request. If it is caused by a defect, an impact analysis
is required to estimate the effort and time to fix it. The resolution is documented. If the analysis results in a change
request the variance is closed and the resolution is documented. <br />
<br />
Variances encountered during test execution will typically fall into the following categories: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Testing Process Errors.
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>

                <strong>Test Execution Errors:</strong> The test executor did not follow the script to the letter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Test Data Error:</strong> The original data created to test the condition did not meet the
                specification of the test data model for the condition.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Test Script Error:</strong> The instructions or responses stated in the script were incorrect.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Test Configuration Error:</strong> The environment was incorrectly configured.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<ol start="2">
    <li>
        Business or Technical Functional Errors.

    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Programming Error:</strong> The code does not match the detailed design.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Design Error:</strong> The design does not meet the functional requirements.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>Variances that are the result of testing process errors usually require the process to be remedied and the test to be
repeated. These errors should also be reviewed to ensure that they have not impacted previous test results.<br />
<br />
Variances that are the result of conflicts between the requirements, specification and / or design and its actual execution
are investigated to determine whether they are true defects or a miscommunication of expectations. The former are referred
to the defect management process and rated for severity and priority for fixing as assigned by the master test plan and the
defect management team. The latter are referred to the change management process to prioritize the revision of
requirements, specification, design and construction of each item. (These items will eventually re-enter the testing
process as defined by the management of the change request.) <br />
<br />
Once defects have been fixed they are re-tested. Re-testing will usually involve re-executing not only the failed test(s)
but a regression set of tests which will ensure that new errors have not been introduced with the fix. If the fix has
worked, the condition can be checked off as being successfully tested. The resolution of all defects should be carefully
documented and signed-off. This information is an important deliverable, that combined with the Actual Results, proves that
the test level/phase is ready for sign-off.</td>

    The integration test status report is a summary of the Integration test results for the reporting period. It includes
    analysis of result information. It describes how well the integration test is progressing. It may be automatically
    generated from the test tool suite or compiled manually.<br />
    <br />
    Some of the measurements produced are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Number of defects found.
    </li>
    <li>
        Severity levels.
    </li>
    <li>
        Status of defects - outstanding, investigated, explained, fixed, re-tested, accepted, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rate of arrival; i.e., defects found per test executed and / or per tested product component, by test period and
        level.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The integration test status report provides an overall summary of the testing progress. It identifies those activities
    completed in the current reporting period and those planned for the next. Any issues, problems, and risks are also
    noted. These reports include information on planned tasks, planned schedule, the actual status of both tasks and
    schedule, the forecasted outlook, issues, recommendations and an action plan . The objective is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Review actual status against plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify and address constraints, concerns and issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify items requiring containment and/or escalation to resolve issues.
    </li>
</ul>Appropriate consolidation and filtering of data is necessary to ensure the key information is input and assimilated at
the respective planning level meetings. Any statistically valid conclusions that can be drawn from these analyses are used
to predict the quality level achieved by the tested product and compared to the target level established in the Integration
Test Plan.</td>
