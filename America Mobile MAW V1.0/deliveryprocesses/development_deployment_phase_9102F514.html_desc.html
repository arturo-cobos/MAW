                    Iterates application prototyping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AWD Approach uses iterative, release-specific prototyping in place of detailed/micro application
                    design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each iteration, this includes:
                </p>
                <p>
                    a) Focusing application prototyping on components, classes and methods at the application level, i.e.,
                    independent of the implementation platform
                </p>
                <p>
                    b) Leveraging JAD/JAR techniques
                </p>
                <p>
                    c) Developing mockups/simulations of the look-and-feel, flow and core of an application using paper
                    simulations, whiteboards, graphics packages or development tools
                </p>
                <p>
                    d) Capturing iterations of business customer feedback, allowing walkthroughs of system flow before
                    extensive effort is expended on development and testing, and performing ongoing train-the-trainer
                    training to the business customer
                </p>
                <p>
                    e) Ensuring the prototype serves as the user interface design specification, i.e., describing the
                    sequence of screens (such as windows, dialog boxes, and prompts) the user expects, and describing the
                    objects, widgets, options, menus, buttons, visuals, dialog boxes, button states, screen behavior, user
                    exception handling, error messages, help text, agents, supporting visuals, and wizards
                </p>
                <p>
                    f) Following the AWD Design, technical standards (e.g., coding, usability, branding) and priorities
                    documented in the AWD Accelerator Plan
                </p>
                <p>
                    g) Effectively employing horizontal and vertical prototyping techniques
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Horizontal prototype (used typically more in the first iteration) represent the customer’s “mental
                        model” of the application, defined as the full breath of business processes represented in
                        look-and-feel, user interface and navigation layers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vertical prototype (used typically more in later iterations) take software functionality (e.g.,
                        transaction, display, report, web page, etc.) seven standard layers (i.e., look-and-feel, user
                        interface, navigation, communications, algorithms, data handling, error handling, and security) for
                        one or more business processes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    h) Utilizing “evolutionary prototyping” instead of “throw away prototyping”
                </p>
                <p>
                    i) Ensuring collective ownership of components by project team members, to allow incorporation of team
                    perspective, fast movement forward and backup for each individual
                </p>
                <p>
                    j) Ensuring traceability to requirements by providing a cross-reference between prototype components
                    and the requirements listed in the Accelerator Plan. Refer to Requirements Traceability Matrix for more
                    information.

                <p>
                    Use Testing Specialists, Testing Centers of Excellence, dedicated test environment(s), automated

                        Complete application modules through programming – complete prototype components, develop source

                        Consider use of test-first methods to receive rapid feedback during development and also for
