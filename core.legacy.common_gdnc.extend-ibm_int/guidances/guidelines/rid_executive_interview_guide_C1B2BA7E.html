    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    It is often valuable to set up interviews with a few of the client’s key e-business leaders the day before the workshop
    begins. These interviews will provide the IBM team with a perspective on the various goals and objectives the client’s
    organization has for the e-business solution. This can provide the IBM team with a better context for framing and
    conducting the Business Requirements Workshop
</p>
<p>
    The intent is NOT to pre-interview all workshop participants. Pre-workshop interviews should be limited to two or three
    key business leaders in the client’s firm, who have a vision and strong expectations for the success of the e-business
    solution.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of this task is to gather background information prior to conducting the Business Requirements
    Workshop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The interviews will allow the IBM team to clarify any issues that may have surfaced in the questionnaires and allow a
    vocal person to “have their say” ahead of time, rather than risking them dominating the workshop.
</p>
<h4>
    2.1&nbsp; Staffing
</h4>
<p>
    The Executive Interviews should be staffed with one (1) engagement manager, who will lead the interview, and one (1)
    consultant who will act as a scribe.&nbsp; Many times, a second pair of ears and eyes will catch a thought or provide
    an insight that one alone will not.&nbsp; Both should have a copy of and be familiar with the questions to be
    asked.&nbsp; There may be times when the consultant briefly leads the questioning to gain better insight into the
    client’s objectives.&nbsp; In this case, it is imperative that the engagement manager continues documenting the
    responses.&nbsp; Put simply, while one IBM team member is asking questions, the other should be documenting responses.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    3.1&nbsp; Prepare Interview Guide
</h4>
<p>
    Before scheduling interviews with the key participants, choose which questions will be asked from the question list in
    <strong>Appendix A.</strong>&nbsp; Copy and paste them to a new document.&nbsp; This list forms the basis for all of
    the key information, and the questions you ask the client should come from or be very closely related to the questions
    on the list.
</p>
<h4>
    3.2&nbsp; Identify Interviewees
</h4>
<p>
    Set up interviews with a few key participants the day before the workshop begins in order to better understand any
    issues that may have surfaced in the questionnaires, or to allow a very vocal person to “have their say” ahead of time
    instead of having them potentially dominate the workshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    3.3&nbsp; Interview Participants
</h4>
<p>
    Prior to the interview you should review the questions, start time, company dress code, and the room/set up
    arrangements for the session with your sponsor.&nbsp; (Experience has proven that the participants will be more relaxed
    and vocal if you can arrange for business casual attire.)
</p>
<h4>
    3.4&nbsp; Review Responses
</h4>
<p>
    After the interviews are completed, the responses to interview questions should be documented in the <strong>BUS 340
    Hypothesis and Data Framework</strong> in Appendix B, which will contain sections specific to the business requirements
    in the matrix.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, the team should analyze the responses to the interview questions and begin to capture key requirements in
    the <strong>ARC119 Non-Functional Requirements</strong>.&nbsp; If the interviews are conducted, the Non-Functional
    Requirements Work Product should be created at this time, and the draft should be updated as the following Phase I
    tasks and activities are conducted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp; For the purposes of RID and general infrastructure design, the Non-Functional Requirements
    Work Product document is to contain requirements that are specific to the design and implementation of the
    infrastructure, its components and their service delivery.&nbsp; It should not be used as a catch-all or trash-bin for
    requirements looking for a home to be documented in.&nbsp; Business process, training and testing requirements do not
    have a place in this document and should be captured in documents for their own purposes.
