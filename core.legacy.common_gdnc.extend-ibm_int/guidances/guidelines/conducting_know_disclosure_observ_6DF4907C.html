    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    Observation is a key tool for collecting information about the organization, whether starting with a specific objective
    such as knowledge disclosure to develop an asset register, or assessing the real issues faced by employees, rather than
    management understanding of them.
</p>
<p>
    In searching for knowledge at its point of creation or use, consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It is more likely to be identified (especially the tacit elements) - “You only know what you know when you need to
        know it”.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It is easier to see how to separate the capture and use of assets.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Interventions can be designed that are appropriate to the real culture, knowledge needs and ways of working.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    By spending several days out in the field it is possible to cover many areas of importance for knowledge management:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Gaining an understanding of the real process and knowledge used -</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Gain an understanding of the day to day work of the department or group under study.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of the real processes (rather than documented ones) used to carry out work in the field/usual place
        of work.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of Knowledge Disclosure Points (KDPs), either within a project environment or in the daily work of
        an individual – these include - decisions, judgements, insights, learning points, problem/issue resolution and
        solution construction – which later on can be used to elicit the knowledge components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify essential knowledge components in a project, department or role – this includes all elements of the ASHEN
        (Artifacts, Skills, Heuristics, Experience and Natural Talent) model, AT THEIR POINT OF USE. This is especially
        important if an asset register is one of the major project deliverables.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Gaining understanding of culture and organization -</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identification of common values, rules or belief systems shared at the corporate, informal, or formal community
        level.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of Archetypes – characters that typify certain cultural aspects of the organization.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Common language, words and phrases that encapsulate certain inbred cultural aspects of the organization, for
        example, “Here comes John with his baseball bat”&nbsp; - summed up the “no blame” culture in a particular
        engineering organization.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizational logistics which prevent/enable communities and individuals to carry out their roles.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Understanding of how the employee presents the image of the company to its customers.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of potential concerns, issues or objections to the project – focussing on enablers and blockers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>People interactions – the real communities</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identification of communities, informal and formal that are either used or bypassed to get the job done – either
        through direct observation or through anecdote elicitation.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Collecting story elements for story projects –</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If some of the expected interventions are expected to use stories then it is important together enough material to
    facilitate their construction and understand how best to disseminate them. Much of this is done as part of the previous
    three objectives. However, particular attention should also be given to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Collection of true anecdotal experiences of individuals or communities for the community/subject areas studied
        (either through direct observation or through anecdote elicitation<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Collection of story elements for story construction – these include context, initiating event, protagonist,
        formidable antagonist, goal, and empathy for the protagonist etc.&nbsp; When eliciting anecdotes, be mindful of the
        story element models that will be used for story construction<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Capture of common language, catch phrases and collective experiences or shared beliefs that a community will relate
        to if portrayed in a teaching story.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is important to bear in mind that it’s very rare to find an anecdote that can be used in isolation as a teaching
    story. It is most often necessary to merge anecdotes, archetypes, story elements, facts, values and rules to generate a
    compelling teaching story of sufficient strength to achieve the project objective.&nbsp; As you’re capturing anecdotes,
    encourage your observee to flesh out the story. Ask them about feelings, characters, facts, reactions, assets used,
    decisions, judgements made etc. If some anecdotes are lacking many of these elements, they should still be captured, as
    they will still be useful for story construction.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp; Ethical Guidelines
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Ask for permission –</strong> In an interview it obvious what you will take away – the conversation.
        Observation could be considered more intrusive as an individual cannot predetermine his/her actions. Be clear up
        front that you will be taking notes (be it in a notebook or on tape) - make sure that you have asked
        permission.&nbsp; Trust is an essential component of the technique.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don’t influence the outcome –</strong> Your task is to observe – not to direct. Do not attempt to alter the
        outcome of events via, for example, friendly advice. In discussions, your task is to help the observee disclose
        their knowledge in the form of anecdotes and sometimes directly as KDP’s, and ASHEN. Don’t lead the
        witness!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Make your observee comfortable -</strong> Observers need to be able to connect with a wide range of people
        at diverse cultural, intellectual and experiential levels. Find out a little about your observee before hand so you
        can converse in their language not that of a consultant. Also, ensure that your dress code is suitable for doing
        their job not yours. Make an effort to be non-threatening, submissive, inquisitive and enthusiastic.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Be flexible –</strong> Don’t arrive with a list of checkpoints to tick off during the day – see what
        unfolds and keep any questioning appropriate for the events of the day.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Be honest and open –</strong> your observee will need to know a little about the project. Provide a very
        brief outline and how their contribution will help. Take care not to focus on concrete goals. The project outcome
        & interventions will not be known until later in the project when a significant amount of disclosure has been
        undertaken. Do not use “consultant speak”&nbsp; - make it relevant to them.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Be interested and curious –</strong> people will open up more if you are interested in what they have to
        say and what they are showing you, so be alert and curious. You are there to listen, absorb and learn, but they
        will often need prompting to tell you more. Be inquisitive, build on the information they share with you. Ask
        follow on questions and encourage them to elaborate anecdotes further, identifying people, conflicts, learning
        points etc. ask them how they felt. Consider how you would you normally tease out this type of information if a
        friend was telling you a story.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stress anonymity and confidentiality –</strong> Letting somebody share your working world for a day/week
        can be daunting. Some people may exhibit camouflage behavior in order to ensure you observe the “correct” behaviors
        (more difficult over a longer period). Also, talking about failures and lessons learnt can be a painful and
        sensitive subject for most people. Reassure your observee that their contribution will be treated with the utmost
        confidentiality; there will be no allocation of blame or backlashes. Make sure you keep this trust – no matter what
        you observe/elicit.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Observe and listen with an open mind –</strong> Do not prejudge your observee or analyze his/her activities
        – you are not there to do process reengineering or mentorship – you are no more than a willing apprentice.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3&nbsp; When to use Observation
</h3>
<p>
    Anthropological observation can be used at several stages of an engagement, however it normally takes place after
    initial selection of an area for study – primarily because it is more time intensive than interviews, which can be
    adequate for the initial selection stage. Observation is a technique best employed in the disclosure phase of a KM
    engagement, to gain understandings of the true workings and knowledge components of an organization.
</p>
<p>
    Observation is best used when activities are of a relatively short duration, can be observed within a day/week time
    period, and are repeatable. On projects that are ongoing for several months, it is often worth having somebody act as
    “journalist”&nbsp; - recording the events as they happen. It may also be the only way of getting a true understanding
    of the organization if getting groups together for story circles (another Knowledge Disclosure technique) is not
    possible.
</p>
<p>
    Several iterations of observation may be necessary – as you learn more about what it is you are observing you will be
    able to focus on different aspects – it can be a lot to take in on a first look.&nbsp; Also, you should be able to
    build on the element of trust in a longer relationship – if you do – don’t abuse it though.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp; General Principals
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Do….</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>When observing –</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Act as the apprentice – make your observee feel comfortable with your presence in their environment (and they, in turn,
    will make you feel comfortable in theirs).&nbsp; Offer to buy coffees, carry their bags, do the dirty work – throw
    yourself into the job and help them as much as you can.
</p>
<p>
    Build a rapport – talk about what is important to them – not necessarily to you.&nbsp; In order for them to gain trust
    in you, you need to show them that you trust them – be self depreciating, give a little of you. Try and bring in
    examples for your own experience that show you understand where they are coming from.
</p>
<p>
    Document conversations with others (if appropriate) verbatim.&nbsp; Make a distinct note of their language, common
    phrases and body language.
</p>
<p>
    Offer to show the observee what you are writing. You may not need to show it but it will help you build up trust and
    put them at ease.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>When eliciting anecdotes –</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Look for areas on the borderline. Explore the points of pain for individuals; ask them for failure stories and hard
    lessons they learned from their own mistakes and those of others.&nbsp; Probe for times when things went wrong but were
    retrieved last minute, when they manage to achieve success over the odds, when all the cards were stacked against them.
    Look at occasions when they had near misses, when situations could have gone very wrong, consider why they didn’t and
    how was the problem resolved. Ask your observee about times when they had good luck and bad luck; you don’t have to
    focus entirely on the truth, you can explore fictional space. Think about the might have been, what could have made
    things go wrong, what could have made things go well.
</p>
<p>
    In all cases though – relate your questions to the activities of the day. E.g. If your observee has just been talking
    with a particularly good/bad customer, ask if all customers are like that. Ask how s/he felt in those situations. Let
    the conversation flow, let it continue even if you think you have discovered what you wanted to hear.
</p>
<p>
    Document conversations with you (if appropriate) verbatim.&nbsp; Make a distinct note of their language and common
    phrases.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Don’t…</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Don’t be an authoritative consultant. Don’t preach or talk down to people. You are there to absorb information and not
    to depart it.<br />
    Don’t be prescriptive with your approach. Don’t use a prepared question sheet. Don’t stop the conversation if you think
    you have heard what you wanted to hear. If your observee takes the discussion in a different direction than you
    anticipated, don’t try to force them back on track to your logical, linear way of thinking. Be prepared to take an
    indirect route to disclosure. Watch their reactions to conversations.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t be too enthusiastic about specific points, if the observee sees that s/he has hit something that interests you,
    s/he may be tempted to carry along that line and exaggerate an area for your sake.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t be afraid to ask direct questions about why your observee has done things in a certain way and what ASHEN s/he
    used – unlike interviewing you are asking at the point of use and in context – make sure you do it in an inquisitive
    (to help you understand better) manner though, not a threatening one.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t offer advice on how to do his/her role better. You are learning not consulting.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Be Prepared…</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This work is very intensive so be prepared for long days and intensive concentration. You need to be extracting as many
    anecdotes and as much information as you can. Take the elicitation techniques with you as a memory jogger and enough
    paper to write reams! Try not to analyze as you are going through the day – it is important for you to remain purely
    reflective. It is difficult to write everything down at the time so make sure you write it up as soon as you can
    afterwards whilst it is still fresh in your mind, write the anecdotes verbatim and then group the issues that you find
    afterwards.
</p>
<h3>
    5&nbsp; Observation Checklist
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Before you get there</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Make sure you are dressed appropriately for the job you are going to help do.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Introduce yourself and give a brief explanation of the purpose of the day – why you are there.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Context</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Set the scene for the day. Explain a little about the project, its objectives and how the day will help. Let him/her
    know you’d like to learn more about the role through seeing what it’s really like and through any practical experiences
    they can tell you about. It is far more beneficial to the project (and them) if they are honest - they should tell (and
    show) things as they are, rather than how they think they should be. Make sure they’re comfortable about your presence
    and speaking in their own language, make sure they don’t formalize, ask them to be themselves and reassure them that
    there’ll be no repercussions from this. This is especially important in observation as you need to make your observee
    feel comfortable enough to open up and tell you both the positive and the negative side of their role, so make sure
    they understand the anonymity of the material and that it will not be used against them. Emphasize the human element of
    the story telling work being undertaken, you may need to share with them some case studies where we’ve undertaken this
    type of work before. Emphasize the benefits; tell teaching stories if you can.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>About them & what they do</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Explore their work and contribution to the community or subject area under study. Understand how long they have been
    with the company and past experiences. Understand where they fit in a project, who they work directly with and what
    communities they are part of. If possible, explore the trusted relationships they have.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Anecdote elicitation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Using the standard anecdote elicitation techniques provided you should spend much of the observation in the pursuit of
    anecdotes. Be sensitive to the situation though – elicitation may be better done in a lunch break if there is much time
    pressure or you are actually visiting customers. Note these down by scribing or capture with a Dictaphone if you have
    their permission.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Close down</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When the day is finished thank your observee for their time and contribution and provide an opportunity for them to ask
    questions of you. Indicate what happens next & how their contribution will be used.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Observation write up</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Write up the day using a standard template against which all observations will be noted. Post the observations as early
    as possible on the teamroom or workspace. Be wary of sharing observation notes with the client, which may be
    controversial or may expose the observee.<br />
    Pass the observation notes to the analysis team for input into the anecdote repository if appropriate.
</p>
<h3>
    6&nbsp; Recommended Anecdote Elicitation Techniques for Observation
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>About them</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Explore your observee’s history, background and story with his/her current employer<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Find out what his/her interests are<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Find out about innovative solutions s/he’s implemented or designed. Consider the associated assets<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask your observee to think about a recent problem experienced, or decisions made. Consider the associated
        assets<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Be specific about lessons learnt. Explore the times when your observee learnt a lesson, whether through insight,
        training or a mistake of his/hers or of another<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore mistakes made, lessons learnt, things s/he’d do differently next time, and problems solved in an innovative
        or successful way
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>About the job</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understand what an apprentice would have to achieve to do his/her job, how long would the skills take to acquire,
        what type of training and experience would be needed, what artifacts are available to support them. Make it
        personal if you can, take on the role of his/her apprentice.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask her/him to imagine s/he has a new apprentice - you. Ask what are the first things you’d have to learn to get
        started in the job<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask about cyclic influences, weekly, monthly, yearly
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Their stories</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ask about high and low points on his/her project or in his/her daily work<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore pain and pleasure points – good moments, bad ones<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask about the best and worst customer s/he’s had. Or, if working with a product, when it has worked and when it has
        had problems<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore fictional space. What might have been, what used to be.&nbsp; Take him/her back to the good old days if you
        can. What’s changed for the better, what’s changed for the worse<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider times when it’s been difficult or easy to do the job<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask about serendipity – has s/he experienced any bad luck or good luck in work?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask about stories s/he’s recently told friends and family about work
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>The company</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ask what it feels like to work for company X. What common values or rules does she/he share with colleagues?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Is s/he well supported and respected in what she/he does? When has the company been there for her/him, when has it
        not?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Find out how s/he interacts with the rest of the company, what other divisions or functions – explore the kind of
        interactions that go on – is it knowledge exchange, information requests, or something else?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Their community</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What degree of trust exists within the community, explore who trusts who, what are the dependencies and
        relationships informal and formal that bind the team together?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask about times where help has been enlisted from others, why was it needed, who were the others, what skills and
        experiences were drawn upon. Explore these trusted relationships.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask about when others have asked him/her for help, who were they, what help did they need<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask the observee which people in the organization they’ve enjoyed working with and why.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Find out if the community ever get together socially, where, how often and what kind of things do they talk about
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    7&nbsp; Tools
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Dictaphone</strong> – to record anecdotes and conversations. Make a note of anecdote titles and their location
    on the tape. Don’t record everything or it will take a very long time to write up.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Notebook</strong> – you’ll be drawing inferences during the day, use a double column notebook to record the key
    verbatim events alongside your comments, inferences and preliminary analysis. Don’t write anything that you are not
    willing to show your observee though – s/he may wish to see what you are writing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Observation Template</strong> – you can aid the deconstruction process by recording the day in a standard
    format using notations to do a preliminary analysis of the text.
