    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    This Technique Paper covers:
</p>The Client strategy regarding whether standards are to be applied to and whether quality control mechanisms are to be
in place to validate the development of: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Package Extensions - to what extent are enhancements to the standard package allowed, what is the process for
        inclusion or exclusion of modifications to the standard package or already developed and accepted programs and
        configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reports - to what extent may standard reports be changed, or reports developed, and how will report development
        requirements be processed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interfaces - what is the process (and criteria) for ‘inventing’ interface development requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Data Conversion programs - what is the process for identifying and processing data conversion requirements.
    </li>
</ul>The development and configuration process to be used, including: 
<ul>
    <li>
        An identification and selection of the development tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        High level decision on where to document the content and media that should be utilized for documenting
        modifications to or configuration of the package.
    </li>
    <li>
        High level environment strategy, e.g., the decision(s) on which environments will be available and for what, e.g.,
        Development system, Configuration/Integration system, Quality Assurance system, Training system, and Production
        system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Security Management Strategy indicating the naming convention to be used for the Security Profile groups.
    </li>
    <li>
        Completed "High Level Security Profile Matrix per Department" indicating the initial number of security profiles
        expected per department.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the "Change Control Strategy" and decide how this will be used within the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    General Guidance
</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of this paper is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Document the project strategy regarding development requirements and how these are processed, what level of
        approval is needed for each type of development (package extensions, reports, interfaces and data conversions).
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify and document the development tools that will be used.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the decision on which environments will be available and their use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the security management strategy
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Naming conventions to be used.
            </li>
            <li>
                The high-level security profiles, giving an indication of the number of security profiles to be implemented
                and thereby the work effort expected.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify how the change in scope will be controlled.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Without strategic decisions relating to development, configuration and documentation, there will be no continuity in
    the techniques adopted by either the technical or non-technical resources on the project. This could result in an
    uncontrolled development or configuration.
</p>
<p>
    The security management will be considered very late, if at all, resulting in no plans being in place when needed with
    a high probability of the security profiles not being in place at go-live.
</p>
<p>
    The scope can change without any management control and can affect the project time scale.
</p>
<h3>
    Development Approach
</h3>
<p>
    Input
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The "Change Control Strategy" white paper
    </li>
    <li>
        The "Environment Strategy" white paper
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Output
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The strategy covering which environments will be available and for what.
    </li>
    <li>
        The "Security Management Strategy" and the approved "High Level Security Profiles Matrix per Department" developed
        per department.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Change Request Procedure for changes to the approved development requirements or configuration, including the
        "Change Request" form and the "Change Request Log" form.
    </li>
    <li>
        The "High Level Package Integration Standards & Procedures" white paper.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    &nbsp;<img height="322" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/PIStds_Proc_Fig1.JPG" width="600" /><br />
    &nbsp;<img height="347" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/PIStds_Proc_Fig2.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    In order to develop the appropriate standards, the following tasks are performed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Review the Change Request Procedure, including the forms.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the development standards and recommendations from the Package Vendor, the Client considerations and
        recommendations from the Implementation Partner.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define and document the Development Tools and Procedures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the configuration standards and recommendations from the Package Vendor and Client considerations, and the
        recommendations from the Implementation Partner.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define and document the Configuration Standards and Procedures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the Environments that will be used.
    </li>
    <li>
        Hold workshop and train on package security management.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop Security Management Strategy (naming conventions for security profiles and a matrix per department showing
        security profiles against job roles).
    </li>
    <li>
        Complete the security matrices per department.
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtain Client approval.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A validation of the initial Security Profiles will be done in the "Detailed Future Justifications" Work Product where
    the individual profiles will be signed off by the Client to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
    It is essential to start the Client thinking about security profiles at an early stage. To help in the development of
    the security profile groups, list the functions to be performed by each job role and group these into security profile
    groups with common access needs.

    A.&nbsp;Recommendation
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Implementation of three tier system landscape</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Due to the nature of the project i.e. the modules that are to be implemented and the fact that this is not a multi-site
    installation, it is recommended that a three tier system landscape be introduced i.e. DEV -&gt; QAS -&gt; PRD.
</p>
<p>
    The Development and Quality assurance instances will be installed on the first AS/400 system and the Production
    instance will be created on a new system to be acquired later in the project.

    Client 200 has been created as a copy of standard SAP client 001 with customizing settings only, i.e. no data and no
    user masters. Client independent customizing changes will be allowed in this client only with transports created for
    importing to other systems. Its client dependent customizing data will always be changed manually, using automatic
    recording to create transports for importing into other clients/systems. No transports into client 200 would be
    allowed. This client should never be used for testing and should not contain any master or transaction data. New
    programs and SAP scripts would be created in client 200 and these would be made available to all other clients. Access
    to this client will be limited to people responsible for customizing and developers only.

<p>
    Client 200 is to be a copy of client 200 once a satisfactory level of configuration has been achieved. It is to be used
    to test out possible configuration settings that once approved would be re-created manually in client 200. This client
    will be available to the whole project team for prototyping purposes.

    Clients 220, 250, 300, 310 would be copies of client 200 once a satisfactory level of customizing had been completed.
    New customizing data would be transported into these clients from 200 as and when necessary. Therefore, changes would
    not be allowed within these clients.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>220&nbsp; Unit Test</strong>
</p>
<p>
    (No changes allowed)
</p>
<p>
    This client would be used to provide a place for programmers to test development effort in a reasonably stable
    environment. Data would be created manually in most cases.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>250 &nbsp;Data Load</strong>
</p>
<p>
    (No changes allowed)
</p>
<p>
    This client would be used to test the data load programs and procedures. Once these were approved they could be used to
    populate the configuration test client with more representative data.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    C.&nbsp;Quality Assurance
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>300 &nbsp;Configuration Test</strong>
</p>
<p>
    (No changes allowed)
</p>
<p>
    This client would be the system test client. Data would be entered manually or via the data load programs once
    approved. This client will be used exclusively to prove that the proposed changes to the production client are
    acceptable to the business.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>310 &nbsp;Training Master</strong>
</p>
<p>
    (No changes allowed)
</p>
<p>
    The training client should be established once the major elements of the configuration have been put in place. It
    should include the user masters and starting data required to provide a meaningful training environment. Once set up
    this client should be saved outside of SAP (exported) and refreshed as necessary (imported) for the start of the next
    training session.
</p>
<h4>
    D.&nbsp;Production
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>400 &nbsp;Production</strong>
</p>
<p>
    (No changes allowed)
</p>
<p>
    The production client will be a copy of client 200 with no data or user masters once the customizing is at the relevant
    stage. Once established there should be no way of changing customizing or data dictionary objects other by transporting
    them from client 200.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>410&nbsp; Pre-Production</strong>
</p>
<p>
    (No changes allowed)
</p>
<p>
    This client will be used purely for stress and volume tests in the Production environment. It will be created and
    refreshed in an identical manner to client 400. Once go-live has been achieved this client will be deleted.
</p>
<h3>
    Proposed Landscape
</h3><br />
<p>
    &nbsp;<img height="359" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/PIStds_Proc_Fig3.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    The SAP R/3 Landscape will consist of three instances, therefore configuration and unit testing is carried out in
    development and system testing in quality assurance.
</p>
<p>
    The Sand Pit client 210 is a play area for prototyping, walkthrough training etc. Test data in this client will be
    compiled for prototyping purposes. This client is to be copied from client 200 once a satisfactory level of
    configuration has been achieved. Once a particular feature of customizing has been agreed upon, it will be re-created
    manually in client 200 which will remain free of any transaction or master data. Customizing data will be transported
    from client 200 to 220 where it can be thoroughly unit tested. When the unit testing has proved successful, the
    transport requests can then be released and transported to clients 250, 300 and 310 for integration testing. All of
    these clients can be refreshed with a copy of the master configuration client 200 as and when required.
</p>
<p>
    The data load client 250 is used to develop and test data loads.
</p>
<p>
    The training client 310 will be included in transports and these will be imported as a matter of course until training
    begins when imports will be carried out on the authorization of the training manager/coordinator.
</p>
<p>
    Client 400 will in essence not be required until the data load or creation of user masters begins immediately prior to
    go live. So this client can be created (or re-created) at that time as a copy of client 200. Once the system is live,
    transports are used to protect data within the production client. When the testing of any configuration change has
    proved to be successful, the transport request can then be imported into client 400 and 410 (if it still exists) in the
    production environment. Client 410 will be used to finally prove data loads and final testing (e.g. volume/stress
    tests) prior to go live.

    All clients are kept aligned using the TMS (Transport Management System).
