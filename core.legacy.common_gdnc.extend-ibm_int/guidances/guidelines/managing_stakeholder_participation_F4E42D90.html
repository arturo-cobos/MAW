    1&nbsp;Description

<p>
    The first step in building support for any project and for providing complete communications is to identify all the
    stakeholders and understand their views around the subject/project.
</p>Often, a project team will focus on the people who are directly affected by the project and not take into account a
broader group who have an interest in the project and are important to the process. In general, stakeholders comprise all
the individuals and groups who may be affected by the project. Typically, these will fall into the following three
categories: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Those directly affected, particularly those who have a lot to gain (or lose) from the change.
    </li>
    <li>
        Key influencers - includes decision makers and change leaders.
    </li>
    <li>
        Those who need to be informed or kept up to date on progress
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Although there can be many different types of stakeholders (i.e., users, the client's customers, the executive sponsor,
    etc.), "investors" are a special group of people who provide resources for the project. They are automatic stakeholders
    and typically expect a return on their investment. It is important to manage and deliver on their expectations.
    Identifying and understanding all the players who have an investment in the project not only helps avoid obstacles
    later on but also enhances the comprehensiveness of the project plan.
</p>Stakeholder Analysis is an essential element of successful change management. The Stakeholder Analysis tool is used to
identify, and subsequently address the concerns of, the people who have some interest in the outcome of the proposed change
along with the stakeholders who are important in the process (i.e., could have an impact on its success or failure).
Emphasis is placed on those who have something to invest in the change, that is, they have some resource (time, money,
etc.) which they can contribute or withdraw. The result of the analysis should be a set of issues and actions to deal with
the concerns of each of the key stakeholders and a way to monitor progress over time.

    </tbody>
</table>Please note that the Stakeholder Analysis Worksheet is an internal working tool for the project team and not a
final deliverable. In addition, it may or may not be appropriate to publish the complete results depending on the politics
or security requirements of the client. 
<p>
    As we move through the project further stakeholders will be uncovered, the ones already identified will become more
    familiar and both their importance and their contribution will change - as such the stakeholder list and analysis
    should be revisited and updated during the course of the project.
