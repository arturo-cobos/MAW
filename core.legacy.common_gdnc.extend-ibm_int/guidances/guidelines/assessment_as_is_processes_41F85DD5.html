<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Step 1 – Initiate Effort
</h4>
<p>
    Collect existing information
</p>
<p>
    To begin, each process team will collect all existing As-Is information. This includes documentation such as existing
    process models, business structures, policies, procedures, legal and organizational structures for all divisions within
    scope. Team members will have to identify the sources of information and collect it. This information will be used as
    an input for the upcoming expert sessions (See Step 3: “Perform process as-is expert sessions”).
</p>
<p>
    Business structures define how organizational units relate internally, relate to one another, and relate to the outside
    world.&nbsp; Gathering this information is critical to our efforts with respect to the asset, as well as our process
    redesign efforts in general. However, a fair amount of the business structure information will be specific to a process
    area.&nbsp; Examples of this information include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        financial and managerial reporting structure (related to Finance)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        sales organization (related to Sales and Marketing)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        logistics network (related to supply chain).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For our purposes, a “policy” is a rule, either explicitly documented or implicitly understood, that fundamentally
    directs an organizational unit’s internal interactions, external interactions, and performance of work.&nbsp; Gathering
    this information will further our understanding of each organizational unit’s current unique business requirements.
    Some example policy areas include:
</p>
<p>
    Prepare for process as-is expert sessions
</p>
<p>
    In order to establish a common understanding of the As-Is environment, we will lead a series of facilitated sessions,
    where related process area experts for the divisions will be in attendance.
</p>
<p>
    Each process team will therefore need to identify appropriate process area experts throughout all divisions within the
    scope. Once experts have been identified, each team will invite these experts to the facilitated sessions, explain to
    them the process and establish a preliminary schedule for confirmation of their responses.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 - Develop Initial Hypotheses
</h4>
<p>
    Before we move into the facilitated sessions, we will identify initial hypotheses throughout all process areas. These
    hypotheses will describe issues we expect to encounter in our data analysis efforts in steps 3 and 4. They are based on
    the project team members’ knowledge of the client’s business. Throughout the steps 3 and 4, we will try to collect data
    to either validate the hypotheses or disprove them.
</p>
<p>
    Once validated, the hypotheses become conclusions, which are the base for our final deliverable (See Step 5:” Summarize
    findings”). Should we disprove a hypothesis, we can form a revised one or disregard it completely. The purpose of this
    step is to ensure that we will gather sufficient data during our fact finding steps 3 and 4 that can support / disprove
    the hypotheses.
</p>
<p>
    Hypotheses might be process specific (e.g., credit checks add cycle time to order processing, etc.) or they might
    overspan the whole business (e.g., current systems do not allow the to utilize its full economies of scale, the sales
    forecast is unreliable in planning manufacturing capacity, etc.).
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 - Assimilate initial findings
</h4>
<p>
    Once the documentation has been collected in step 1 (“Gather existing information”), each team will integrate this
    information into the As-Is process definition and assessment deliverable. This deliverable will address business
    structures, policies, and process measures. In addition, the team members will start to identify key process
    differences between business organizations (divisions, geographies, functions, etc.) and document them in the profiles
    as well.&nbsp; The differences will alert each team to the potential challenges that may be faced if the effort is
    intended to standardize processes across business organizations to conform for the asset.
</p>
<p>
    Collecting the measures will allow us to validate the business case and establish the To-Be performance targets.&nbsp;
    Certain process measures, such as volume and headcount, will be consistent across the process teams.&nbsp; Process
    measures related to cost and quality will need to be tailored by each process team.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4 - Perform Process Expert Sessions
</h4>
<p>
    The primary purpose of this step is to establish a common understanding of the As-Is environment.&nbsp; This will be
    accomplished through a series of facilitated sessions, where related process area experts for the divisions will be in
    attendance.
</p>
<p>
    In these facilitated sessions, we will confirm the information we received in step 1 and we will investigate missing
    information for process areas as well as divisions.&nbsp; We will also describe the methodology/approach to foster the
    change management effort.
</p>
<p>
    Clarifying policy information will be one of our biggest challenges.&nbsp; Policies provide insight into underlying
    assumptions of an organization, but they can be evasive.&nbsp; For example, policies may be implicitly understood by
    employees because of daily practices, explicitly documented in policy manuals, hidden in information systems, or all of
    the above.&nbsp; Care needs to be taken to ensure that the stated policy is the policy in practice.
</p>
<p>
    Also, identifying issues and barriers will be an essential part of this step.&nbsp; Accurately capturing this
    information will help “bring to life” the pain of the current environment, making the move to the future state more
    palatable.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 5 - I Summarize findings
</h4>
<p>
    Finally, we will complete the As-Is process definition and assessment. This work document includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Validated As-Is business process models<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Key process differences between divisions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Important issues and problems<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Areas of improvement.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, we will integrate the findings and conclusions from this effort into the overall critical issues/entry
    points deliverable. This deliverable summarizes all analysis efforts - the as-is process effort, the customer
    requirement study, the leading practices, and the strategy and industry trend confirmation. This deliverable will be
    critical to developing and selling the “To Be” design.&nbsp;<br />
