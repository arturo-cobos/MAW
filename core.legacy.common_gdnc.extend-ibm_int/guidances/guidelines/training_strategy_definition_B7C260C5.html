    1&nbsp;Introduction – Training Definition
</h3>
<p>
    To facilitate the job/role changes that occur with the redesign of a business process an effective training program is
    essential.&nbsp; Training is the process through which skills are developed, information is provided and attitudes are
    nurtured to help individuals more effectively and efficiently fulfill the roles they are called upon to play in the
    workplace.&nbsp; The key objectives of training process are to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Assist the organization in obtaining its goals<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide general employee enrichment<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enable the enhancement and transformation of roles to add value to the enterprise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilitate and maximize learning.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The development of an effective training program is based upon the human performance management model (figure 1) which
    serves as the framework for the assessment, redesign or creation of human performance improvement programs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <img height="356" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/training_strategy_def_fig1.JPG" width="502" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This model links the optimum human performance to the business goals of the organization and ultimately to customer
    wants and needs.&nbsp; The actual current performance level is compared with the optimum performance to identify
    gaps.&nbsp; These gaps are then investigated and analyzed to identify their cause.&nbsp; Once the cause(s) have been
    identified a solution(s) is selected based upon the cause and a plan is designed to deliver the solution.&nbsp; The
    process for the development of a training program is a subset of this model, and is based upon the issue-based
    consulting process.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The 5 major stages of this process are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Initialization / planning<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Data collection&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Data analysis and synthesis&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Review and validation<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Final report recommendations.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note: On those projects which require the development of a comprehensive training strategy and program, we recommend
    that a Global
</p>
<p>
    Learning Services consultant who specializes in the development of education and training programs be added to the team
    to lead this portion of the engagement
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    The techniques covered in this paper provide direction for structuring a training strategy for clients as part of an
    engagement that proposes the implementation of a redesigned client solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The paper supports the
    development of the following work products:
</p>
<p>
    Education and Training Plan
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Training and User Support Approach<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        IT Organizational Skills Gap Analysis
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Stage One – Initialization / Planning
</h3>
<p>
    During this stage the blueprint for the subsequent stages for the development of a training program is
    established.&nbsp; Specifically you will:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Confirm project goals and scope<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify key participants for development of training program.&nbsp; The participants should be a mixture of
        subject matter experts, targeted roles/jobs and business leadership.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop data framework for identification of requirements for training program
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Below are some examples of hypotheses that could be investigated:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Business linkage 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The level of performance required on proposed solution to achieve business goals has been determined
            </li>
            <li>
                The desired business outcomes for the training have been established.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Current skills 
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Current skill and performance levels of targeted roles/jobs have been identified.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Required skills 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The proposed solution will require new skills.
            </li>
            <li>
                Critical skills required for proposed solution have been identified.
            </li>
            <li>
                The jobs/roles requiring new skills have been identified
            </li>
            <li>
                All training/non-training elements of performance gaps with associated recommendations are identified and
                the value of closing each gap has been determined<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Job enhancement 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Training will enrich jobs and improve productivity.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Ongoing improvement 
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Skills management process is in place for job roles involved with proposed solution.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Infrastructure 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use of complex learning technologies is a potential intervention
            </li>
            <li>
                Technical infrastructure supports complex learning technologies implementation
            </li>
            <li>
                Benefits and feasibility of using complex learning technologies have been analyzed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Executive commitment exists for implementing learning technology.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Stage Two – Data Collection
</h3>
<p>
    During the data collection stage the specific data needs to validate the hypotheses to be investigated will be
    developed.&nbsp; The data that is gathered will be used to define the training requirements and strategy.
</p>
<p>
    The strategy for gathering data should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        input from role and job definition for the new process<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        workshops with subject mater experts, business leadership and targeted job roles<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        interviews with executive team from impacted areas
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    5&nbsp;Stage Three – Data Analysis and Synthesis
</h3>
<p>
    During the data synthesis and analysis stage the information gathered is sorted under the hypotheses and structured to
    depict key requirements.&nbsp; The overarching question we are trying to answer is ‘What kind of outcome is the goal of
    the training?’ If the learning outcomes can be identified the appropriate strategy can be selected to achieve
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; These learning outcomes should be closely linked to business goals.
</p>
<p>
    Once the desired outcomes have been identified they need to be broken down into its component parts and the key skills
    required achieving them. Figure 2 is an example of how key skills to be included in training program can be identified
    and prioritized.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="391" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/training_strategy_def_fig2.JPG" width="513" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In addition, during this stage the precise description of the subject matter to be covered in the training program must
    be determined. Some factors to consider when describing training content are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scope - where does subject begin and end?&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Breadth - how much of the defined subject can be covered within the given time span?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Depth - How deeply should the training go into skill?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Priority - which are the most important topics and should be emphasized<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Sequence - In what sequence should the topics or skills logically be taught? Is there interdependency between
        topics and skills?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Limits - What is outside of scope and not being covered? Will these topics be covered later?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Message - what message needs to be conveyed to students through the training?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As part of the description of the content of the training program each of the skills should be broken into concise
    behavioral objectives.&nbsp; These objectives should be measurable and observable behavior as a result of the
    training.&nbsp; These objectives should be very specific and open to very little interpretation.&nbsp; Below are some
    examples of phrases to begin the objectives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        to write<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        to enter<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        to complete<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        to solve<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        to construct<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        to list<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        to identify.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These objectives should also specify under what conditions will the objectives be meet i.e. at the end of this 1 hour
    exercise and the completion criteria for the behavior.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="410" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/training_strategy_def_fig3a.JPG" width="524" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 3A</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <img height="515" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/training_strategy_def_fig3b.JPG" width="547" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 3B</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Well written, concise behavioral objectives will establish the foundation upon which the training program should be
    built.<br />
    In addition, a skills proficiency scale (figure 3A/B) should be documented and used to
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        determine current skill levels&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        map the behavioral objectives<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        map the optimum performance levels
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    for the gap analysis for each of the required skills.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The selection of the delivery strategy for the training must take into account several factors (figure 4):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Organizational attributes - size large organizations tend towards more formal training for coverage and consistency
        Vs informal training for smaller organizations; existing training infrastructure; culture&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Subject matter volatility - stable standard information&nbsp; Vs volatile changing<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Hands on requirement - lab or workshop requirements<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Development Time frame - group learning with short development time Vs self directed with longer development time
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Development and delivery costs - group learning increases delivery costs while self directed learning increases
    development cost.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><img height="402" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/training_strategy_def_fig4.JPG" width="591" /></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
    These factors should be matrixed in table and rated based on the advantages / disadvantages for the client to identify
    the most appropriate delivery strategy.&nbsp; As a key part of any delivery strategy ongoing support through mentoring
    and user support structures should be considered.<br />
    In addition, a skills road map identifying what education and experience an employee should have to attain a given
    skill levels over time may be required (Figure 5).
</p>
<p>
    <img height="460" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/training_strategy_def_fig5.JPG" width="558" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 5</strong>
</p>
<h3>
    6&nbsp;Step Four – Review and Validation
</h3>
<p>
    The results of the data synthesis and analysis should be review with training team to
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        identify any gaps in information or logic<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        gain buy in.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Any gaps that are identified could be feed into another iteration of the data gather, synthesis and analysis stages.
</p>
<h3>
    7&nbsp;Step Five – Final Reports and Recommendations
</h3>
<p>
    The final report elements should dramatically depict the recommendations that are based on the results of the data
    gathering and analysis.&nbsp; These recommendations should be focus on how training will enable the transition to the
    proposed solution based on the key skills that will be developed to achieve the desired business outcomes.&nbsp;
