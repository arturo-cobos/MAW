    After the Systems Engineer and Architecture team has defined the technical baselines (including the requirements
    deliverables and architecture deliverables, the team will support the development and test teams for the rest of the
    project life cycle.
</p>Throughout the project, the Systems Engineer must control changes to the technical baselines. The technical baselines
include the requirements documentation and the design/architecture documentation.

<h3>
    2&nbsp;Details
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Support to the Component Development/Test teams</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The systems engineer will support the development teams throughout the development cycle - originally through the
    development of the system and component requirements.
</p>
<p>
    During the Develop phase of the project (after the component requirements have been defined for the development teams),
    the systems engineer with support the development teams in two ways:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Controlling baseline change requests;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Resolving requirements questions/conflicts from the development teams.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Baseline changes requests are changes/additions/deletions to the current baseline documents. All changes must be
    approved by the customer and IGS. The development team will assess any changes before they are approved.
</p>
<p>
    Requirement questions/conflicts will also be resolved by the systems engineer. The systems engineer will review the
    requirement(s) with the questioning parties, and work with the parties to clarify the requirements. If changes to the
    requirements are needed, then the baseline change request will be written and the process described above will be
    performed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Support to the Verification and Validated teams</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The systems engineer will support the verification and validation test teams throughout the development cycle -
    originally through the development of the system and component requirements and through the creation of the
    Requirements Traceability and Verification Matrix (RTVM). The RTVM describes the acceptance criteria for each
    requirement and the test method / test phase in which the requirement will be tested.<br />
    During verification and validation, while tests are being run, the systems engineer will support the development and
    test teams in a ‘Requirements Analysis’ role:
</p>
<p>
    ‘<em>Requirements Analysis’ Scenario:</em>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        As testers work through test cases, they generate test incident reports (TIRs) to document where they believe the
        application under test has failed a given test step. These TIRs are typically routed into a development process to
        address as defects.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In some number of cases, however, development team may object that a TIR is not a defect; they will typically state
        that the system is “working as specified” (WAS). This means that they believe that the reviewed and approved design
        has been implemented and is functioning as expected. It may turn out that the test case is not valid, or that the
        tester was not aware of a changed process, or some other misunderstanding that would allow the TIR to be closed
        without changes to the application.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In some subset of these “WAS” cases, however, the tester and/or the customer may disagree and insist that the
        agreed-to functionality or performance has not been delivered. In these cases, where development and the tester are
        at a standoff, the TIR may be placed into ‘a Requirements Analysis queue’.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    ‘<em>Requirements Analysis’&nbsp; role:</em>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Systems Engineer must take the TIRs placed in the Requirements Analysis queue and determine whether the TIR is
        a defect or not.
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Systems Engineer must review the requirements and the design information, plus any relevant supporting
                materials, to determine if the TIR is a defect or not. This requires, at a minimum, understanding why
                development thinks the function is WAS and why the tester thinks it is a defect.
            </li>
            <li>
                If it is determined to be a defect, then the development team fixes it as such.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the system is determined to be working as specified, then a project change request must be created.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the TIRs in the Requirements Analysis queue need to be fixed whether they are a defect or not. The
                most common non-defect situation is a missed requirement: the requirements or the design did not adequately
                cover the function or, worse, incorrectly specified it (perhaps based on an incorrect but unchallenged
                underlying assumption). For the situation of a missed requirement, the Systems Engineer must work with the
                stakeholders to ensure that a project change request is developed that correctly documents the requirement.
                If the change request cannot be immediately supported, it may also be necessary to discuss interim or
                stop-gap measures. In some cases, mini-design reviews may be needed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <em>Requirements Analysis’&nbsp;effort:</em>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unlike the Concept Phase requirements definition and review activities, the testing Requirements Analysis workload
        does not follow a fixed timeline, with milestones and checkpoints. The TIRs flow into the Requirements Analysis
        queue as they are encountered. And if there are concurrent test activities / phases, there will be multiple
        Requirements Analysis queues. Usually, by the time the TIR enters the Requirements Analysis queue, it has already
        been discussed between the development and test teams; as a result, the Systems Engineer may receive it with a week
        already elapsed since it was opened and focus (possibly executive) already on it. The result is that this is an
        “interrupt based” process; the Systems Engineer will typically have to focus on any severity 1 and 2 TIRs in their
        queue until there is a resolution, to the exclusion of other responsibilities.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Systems Engineering effort is completely dependent on the size of the project and the test effort, and the
        quality of the requirements and design documentation. A rough estimate would be full-time during first third of the
        verification and validation phases and quarter time for the remainder of the phases.
    </li>
