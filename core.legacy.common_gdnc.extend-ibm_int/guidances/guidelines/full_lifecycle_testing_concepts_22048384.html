<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The purpose of a testing method is to provide a structured approach and discipline to testing. It includes test planning,
managing and controlling the testing process, and testing techniques. The full lifecycle testing methodology being
introduced in this concepts manual outlines the generic testing processes and techniques needed to test applications. This
methodology is targeted for the development project teams (business and technical staff). 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

</table>When testing responsibility falls outside of the scope of the development team, reference is made to external
testing processes for completeness purposes only. As preparations are made to pass the system to a group outside of the
development team for testing, it is expected that the project development team will consult the external group or their
documentation for guidance.

</table>The full lifecycle testing methodology has three parts: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Testing Concepts
    </li>
    <li>
        Test Process Model
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing Standards
    </li>
</ul><b>Testing Concepts</b>, describes the "why" and "what" of the testing discipline. It presents the concepts relating
to test planning, test preparation, test execution and test reporting. It covers, at a generic level, every facet of
testing; types, techniques, levels, and integration approaches. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table><b>Test Process Model</b>, describes the "how," "who" and "when" of testing. It explains the processes, procedures
and tools needed to support a structured approach to testing. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table><b>Testing Standards</b>, describes the criteria to be met in order for specific levels of testing (such as
Operability testing) to be considered acceptable by the organization. In most organizations the standards are owned and
managed by the <b>Quality Assurance</b> group. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table><b>Testing Courses</b>, available separately, teach the concepts of testing a software application using the full
lifecycle testing approach and reinforce them with a case study that applies these processes, tools, and techniques. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>Since this is a generic methodology, we will only be describing tools and techniques that are generic to testing.
The descriptions will be at a level that will give the reader the concept of what the tool or technique is and its
relevance to the testing process. Inspections are one example of such a technique. The reader may pursue additional
education at a greater level of detail outside of this methodology documentation. 
<p>
    It is suggested that anyone who is a novice to testing should read the concepts document completely from front-to-back
    and/or attend the course. Experienced test or development personnel can use this document as reference. It is expected
    that the <i>Testing Process Model</i> content will be tailored to meet the unique needs of your application, project
    life cycle, and testing requirements. <i>Testing Standards,</i> where available as part of organizational standards,
    will be used alongside the Test Process Model to insure the application development is conducted according to the needs
    of the organization.
