    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    The design workshop is the heart of a process redesign engagement. The objective of the process design workshop is to
    assist the client in describing his new "To-Be" process, which will address his business requirements. The design
    workshop is a joint effort with the client requiring full time commitment from all participants. This approach which
    combines the business knowledge and process expertise from the client with the leadership and technology expertise of
    our consultants has proven to be extremely effective in developing client solutions in days rather than weeks or
    months. It is imperative that before automating a process this workshop is run to ensure that we are not just
    automating a bad process, increasing the speed or consistency of a poor process.

</ul>
<p>
    See the appropriate work product description for recommended sections, notation, sample templates and specific
    considerations.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Stage One: Planning and Logistics
</h3>
<p>
    The planning and setup for the design workshop should be thoroughly thought out to ensure that the workshop is
    effective and focused on the client’s issues.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;The key steps in this stage are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify and invite participants<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Reserve room and workshop materials<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create the redesign workshop pre-read package<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create the design hypothesis
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    3.1&nbsp; Identify and Invite Participants
</h4>
<p>
    In conjunction with the project sponsor the participants in the workshop should be selected from those departments that
    potentially will play a role in the ‘To-Be’ process.&nbsp; It is important that the people selected to participate are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        regarded as leaders and respected by their peers rather than just being available<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        knowledgeable in both business and process<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        open minded forward thinkers<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        committed full time.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Without the right people participating you run the risk of having your recommendations either being incomplete, or
    having difficulty gaining full acceptance by the client.&nbsp; Both during and after the workshop, the participants
    must be advocates of the new process design, to begin to sow the seeds of change.
</p>
<p>
    The letter of invitation should come from the project sponsor stating the objective of the workshop, the role and
    reason for each person’s participation.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    3.2&nbsp; Reserve Room and Workshop materials
</h4>
<p>
    The room that is reserved for the workshop should be large enough to fit all participants (6-15) comfortably around a
    conference room table or set of tables arranged in a horse-shoe configuration to invite discussion.&nbsp; If possible
    the workshop should be held away from the normal work location of participants to avoid interruptions.&nbsp; The room
    should have plenty of wall space for hanging work sheets and flip charts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The materials typically needed for a design workshop are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 overhead foil projectors and 2 screens (or equivalent)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        2 flip chart stands<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        2 sheet flip chart pads<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        3 to 4 rolls of continuous flip chart paper<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        3x5 index cards 5 colors<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        5x7 index cards 5 colors<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Colored markers 5 colors<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        1 box of blank foil paper<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Foil pens<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Pads&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Pencils<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        2 spray cans of Post-It glue<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Masking tape<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Push pins<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Post-It pads
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Refreshments should also be available throughout workshop.
</p>
<h4>
    3.3&nbsp; Create Design Workshop Pre-read Package
</h4>
<p>
    To ensure that all participants are on the same level and can fully participate a pre-read background package should be
    assembled, and distributed to all participants at least a week before workshop.&nbsp; This package should contain
    earlier work products (or extracts from them), with items such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        As-Is Process Definition and Assessment (e.g. using LOVEM chart)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        LOVEM technique<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Process and business area profiles (e.g. As-Is Process Definition and Assessment, As-Is Organization
        Description)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Preliminary requirements list (e.g. Target Future Business Capabilities, Future System Attributes)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Task analysis worksheets (As-Is Process Definition and Assessment)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Technology overviews (e.g. Architecture Overview Diagram)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Project goals<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Workshop goals and objectives<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Client business goals, objectives and issues (e.g. Target Future Business Capabilities, Critical Issues and Entry
        points)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Key summary information such as Project Goals and Envisioned To-Be Business Goals* should be put onto flip charts and
    posted in workshop room.
</p>
<h4>
    3.4&nbsp; Create ‘Design Hypothesis’
</h4>
<p>
    Based on the information gathered from the client through interviews, observations, the issue diagram and the As-Is
    process flows, the engagement team (without the client) should develop a design hypothesis.&nbsp; This design
    hypothesis identifies client redesign issues in the as-is process and a straw man informal potential
    solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this hypothesis is to assist the facilitation of the workshop if it bogs down or
    drifts off focus.&nbsp; This design hypothesis may or may not be the right answer, but can be tested during the
    workshop.&nbsp; Clients will expect that the consultants will have a potential solution like the design hypothesis in
    mind, based on the consultant’s experience with other clients.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Stage Two: Process Redesign
</h3>
<p>
    The process redesign phase will typically have 7 steps:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Kick off Design Workshop<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Review existing process<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluate As-Is situation<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Document opportunities for improvement<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Define goals of process redesign<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Define constraints<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Streamline the process
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    4.1&nbsp; Kick Off Design Workshop
</h4>
<p>
    In the kickoff of the design workshop the following items will typically be covered:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Welcome by executive sponsor and project positioning<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Participant introductions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain the joint design process<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Define roles and responsibilities<br />
        -&nbsp; Consultants - workshop facilitation and technology expertise<br />
        -&nbsp; Client team - business and process expertise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Technology overview<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Workshop ground rules<br />
        -&nbsp; All voices equal - no titles in room<br />
        -&nbsp; One person speaking at a time<br />
        -&nbsp; Schedule integrity<br />
        &nbsp;Keep focus
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    4.2&nbsp; Review Existing Process
</h4>
<p>
    Review the As-Is Process Definition and task analysis sheets* with workshop participants for accuracy.&nbsp; Correct
    any discrepancies based on participant feedback and concurrence.
</p>
<h4>
    4.3&nbsp; Evaluate As-Is Process
</h4>
<p>
    Once the As-Is process has been corrected and agreed upon, conduct a discussion to identify weaknesses and shortcomings
    in the current process, and their impact on the business.&nbsp; Where possible establish process benchmarks either
    within client or in similar companies.&nbsp; Rate the process by group, based on changes needed and value
    assessment.&nbsp; Some rating criteria that could be used are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Effectiveness - Does the output of the previous activity support the input requirements of the following
        activity?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Efficiency - How well are the resources used to produce output?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cycle time - How long does it take to complete activity or process?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cost - How much does it cost to complete each activity or process?
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    4.4&nbsp; Document Opportunities for Improvement
</h4>
<p>
    During the discussion problem areas in process should be documented with a brief explanation of the problem and its
    business impact.&nbsp; These potential areas for improvement should be summarized and agreed upon by participants.
</p>
<h4>
    4.5&nbsp; Define Goals of Process Redesign
</h4>
<p>
    The group should now define a vision statement and goals for the redesign of the process, in the form of Target Future
    Business Capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; This vision statement should be linked to the overall objectives of the project and
    the issues identified in the review of the As-Is process.
</p>
<h4>
    4.6&nbsp; Define the Constraints
</h4>
<p>
    Before redesigning process it is important to identify business constraints to ensure that what is designed will be
    implementable.&nbsp; Constraints can be such things as budget dollars, time constraints, labor restraints, etc.
</p>
<h4>
    4.7&nbsp; Redesign the Process
</h4>
<p>
    When redesigning a process there are two approaches that can be taken.&nbsp; The first approach is to ‘retool’ the
    existing process and those steps which conflict with the client’s objectives.&nbsp; This tends to be more structured
    and somewhat easier to do, since you are applying incremental changes to existing processes.&nbsp; The second approach
    is to start with a ‘clean sheet’ of paper.&nbsp; This approach is somewhat more difficult and requires thinking outside
    of the box.&nbsp; The outcome of this approach could have far reaching effects on the organization when implemented
    such as dramatically redefined or eliminated roles.&nbsp; It is up to the engagement manager and project sponsor to
    agree upon which approach should be taken in workshop.
</p>
<p>
    During the workshop a number of techniques will be used to develop new process such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Root cause analysis to determine the reasons for poor performance of process or activity<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Brainstorming open discussion to identify alternate solutions, and evaluate pros and cons of proposed solutions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, for the interactive mapping of the new process the continuous roll of flip chart paper should be rolled
    out onto the longest wall in the room, creating a ‘redesign wall’ which can easily be seen by all participants.&nbsp;
    LOVEM swim lanes should be outlined on the redesign wall and the index cards used to record activity or system for
    various roles or departments.&nbsp; The index cards should be attached to the redesign wall using Post-It spray so that
    they can easily be moved around.
</p>
<p>
    During workshop various client participants should be asked to review process flows with the group to ensure
    understanding, buy-in and ownership of the new process by all participants.
</p>
<h3>
    5&nbsp;Stage Three: Technology Enabling
</h3>
<p>
    This stage examines the information needs of the redesigned process, and assesses the ability of appropriate
    technologies to fulfill identified requirements and overcome constraints.&nbsp; This stage may be interwoven stage 2
    (process redesign) – i.e. as a process is being redesigned, technologies are considered for each activity as it is
    identified.
</p>
<p>
    As the technologies are analyzed and reviewed, any changes that will significantly effect the existing environment
    should be highlighted to the client.&nbsp; If there are potential major organizational changes as a result of the
    redesigned process or enabling technologies, an organizational assessment may be required.
</p>
<p>
    The final output of the workshop should be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Redesigned process - created using index cards on flip chart paper and entered into process mapping tool i.e.&nbsp;
        Visio, Pro Modeler, etc. (work products - Future Process Design Points, To-Be Process Model)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        High level graphic technology architecture (Architecture Overview Diagram)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        User interface requirements (Future System Attributes)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Critical measurement points (in To-Be Process Design)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Role descriptions (Role and Job Design)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizational considerations (To-Be Organization Design)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        System requirements (e.g. Future System Attributes, Use Case Model)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        System benefits (becomes part of Solution Recommendation and Business Case)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Completed task analysis work sheets&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
