    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    This technique supplements BUS 309 - Process Definition for future processes from an EAS perspective.
</p>There are many reasons to go through the process of developing the Future Process Design Points: 
<ul>
    <li>
        To provide a context and a set of requirements to the design of the Future processes: Discussing and agreeing the
        future process design points helps focus the functional Subject Matter Experts (SME) and the Package (e.g., SAP R/3
        and Baan) Specialists on the structure they have to work within when developing the detailed design of the
        processes and the Package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizing the design work: Because designing the process flows and resolving issues is difficult and
        time-consuming, it is more efficient to break the work into manageable parts. The future process design points are
        the first step in the design of the business processes. Subsequent documents are the more detailed Future process
        design, and business scenarios (must cover both business processes and package design).
    </li>
    <li>
        Gaining buy-in from process managers: Process managers are the primary participants in the working sessions that
        develop the future process design points. Not only do they develop the design points of the new processes, they
        also develop a sense of moving the organization forward. It also gives the functional managers a better sense of
        the functionality provided by the IBM asset, which they learn as they discuss the Future design opportunities.
        Finally, it gives the functional managers a chance to hear and understand management's expectations (i.e., the
        target future business capabilities).
    </li>
    <li>
        Getting a head start on configuration: IBM Package experts usually sit in during the working sessions to begin
        understanding the way the new processes will work. This allows them to begin configuring the software. Obviously,
        they are not able to configure the entire system based on the results of these working sessions, but they can gain
        useful information on how to start.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Future process design points are used as the first of three documents that describe the business processes.
</p>
<h3>
    Steps/Development Approach
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Start from a list of target business capabilities.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The recommended approach is a series of workshops each covering a segment of the business.&nbsp; The facilitator
        should have a good working knowledge of the PEBT approach.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The client project team should develop the process flow and business scenarios together.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        For each process flow the process capabilities, Key Performance Indicators as well as requirements to process
        performance will be defined & documented.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The IBM consultants will review the process flows and business scenarios and coach the client on how to improve
        them (e.g., missing items, fragmented ideas, incomplete process flows, etc.).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ideally FPA information will be recorded real time through facilitated workshops using AdvisoryWare.&nbsp; This
        must be supervised by an experienced PEBT consultant with the proper tool training.&nbsp; Regardless of the
        approach used, the results of these workshops must be input into AdvisoryWare to allow feedback of this
        intellectual capital to the world wide PEBT competency.&nbsp; This functionality is available in the “Iccore&nbsp;
        - Client Environment - Process Configuration” section of AdvisoryWare.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The workshop facilitator should:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Prepare carefully and thoroughly for each topic by gathering sufficient background information<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep the work moving&nbsp;<br />
        -&nbsp; avoid lengthy debates&nbsp;<br />
        -&nbsp; avoid plunging into detail during the workshop<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Seek consensus, not unanimity, among the participants - "Can you live with it?"<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare the deliverables after the workshop using content developed in the workshop
    </li>
