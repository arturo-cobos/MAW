    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    During a two day session, the client senior management team will be asked to discuss the key business issues facing the
    client, requirements identified by their customers, and through the development of To-Be characteristics, provide
    direction for the redesign of selected the client business processes. This will be accomplished through a series of
    breakout sessions and presentations during this two day event. The success of the session will depend on the
    preparation of the As-Is key findings. Our approach is divided into the following major steps.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Prepare for executive design session
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct planning meetings with CEO, CFO and COO
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct executive design session
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarize the executive design sessions
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The following section summarizes the approach for each of the above steps:
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Step 1 - Prepare for executive design session
</h4>
<p>
    Preparation for the executive design session will involve completing the key findings of the As-Is analysis.&nbsp;
    During this analysis, each process team will be responsible for summarizing and developing an executive summary of the
    “As-Is” which will include issues, leading practices, customer requirements and strategy & industry trend
    information&nbsp; (i.e. the critical issues and entry point deliverable).&nbsp; This information will be presented in
    the session to help facilitate the discussion between the client executives.&nbsp; The objective is to generate ideas
    and get agreement from the executives on key issues and process characteristics critical to the success of the client
    and that must be addressed during the redesign efforts.
</p>
<p>
    The CEO, CFO, COO should review the deliverable before it is presented to the remaining executives.
</p>
<p>
    Also, each process team should meet prior to the session to develop a preliminary list of topics they would like to
    have the executives address during the session. The process team leaders will provide their list of topics to the IBM
    facilitator prior to the start of the session.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 - Conduct planning meetings with the CEO,CFO & COO
</h4>
<p>
    There will be one meeting with the CEO, CFO & COO to prepare for the sessions.&nbsp; The client and IBM project
    managers, as well as the IBM principal should attend the meeting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The objective of this meeting is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Discuss the strategy/direction/vision of the client;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss process design principles;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss session topics; and<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Review key conclusions developed by the teams.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Based on the outcome of this meeting, each team will be responsible for making appropriate changes to the As-Is
    deliverable before the executive design session. These key conclusions should then be distributed as pre-read material
    to the executive design session participants. Project team members should contact the executives, inform them of the
    material and answer any questions or concerns the executives might have before the session.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, team members should make arrangements to meet with some of the executives individually in order to
    pre-sell the material that will be discussed during the executive design session.&nbsp; In this way, there will be some
    prior knowledge of the topics which are intended to be discussed, and some discussions will have already taken place
    around the issues surrounding the As-Is, and the team members will understand the relative position of the executives
    towards those issues.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 - Conduct executive design session
</h4>
<p>
    The To-Be Executive Design session will consist of a series of breakout sessions to discuss each business process that
    will be redesigned during the project.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Each Process Team will present their As-Is executive summary to the executives to provide a common understanding of the
    issues, customer requirements, leading practices, and strategy & industry trend information related to their
    process area.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The executives will then be divided into sub-groups (possibly based on area of responsibility, but mixed up a little to
    provide creative insights) and asked to participate in one of the scheduled breakout sessions.&nbsp; Each breakout
    session will focus on a different set of business processes.&nbsp; At the end of each breakout session, a
    representative (i.e., executive) from each sub-group will present to the entire group, the issues, process
    characteristics and target future business capabilities identified, with the intent of gathering additional input and
    gaining consensus on key To-Be characteristics.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Once completed, the group will discuss as a whole the issues, challenges and barriers the client will face in
    implementing a new To-Be design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <em>This approach is based on the assumption that there will be significant representation from the client Senior
    Management.&nbsp; If there is minimal participation for the To-Be Executive design session, a single group session (no
    breakout sessions) will be held to accomplish the same objectives.</em>
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4 -&nbsp; Summarize the Executive Design sessions
</h4>
<p>
    Following the two-day executive design session, the output will be collected, summarized and distributed.&nbsp; The
    target future business capabilities and future process design points deliverables typically include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Guiding Principles&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        People, Process, and Technology characteristics<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Design requirements for the new processes<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Barriers to be resolved before implementation<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Key Assumptions to use for To-Be design
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Project team members who participated in those sessions will summarize this information from the breakout sessions.
    Once completed, the document will be distributed to the session participants for validation of completeness and
    accuracy.&nbsp; After feedback has been received from the executives, the documents will be combined, finalized and
    distributed to the process teams for use during the To-Be Design sessions.
</p>
<p>
    The results of the executive design sessions will likely have implications on the way business is currently conducted
    at the client. The implications will be grouped by process area, along with any preliminary thoughts on how to
    incorporate them into the To-Be design.
</p>
<p>
    During this phase, <strong><em>the</em></strong> team members not in attendance at the sessions will be briefed on the
    discussions, issues, and direction given by the Executives. This is a very important transfer of knowledge that will
    prepare the team for the To-Be design effort.

    <strong><em>Breakout Session Example</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The following is an example of how the breakout sessions will typically take place.
</p>
<p>
    A BT consultant from IBM will facilitate each breakout.&nbsp; To begin, the facilitator will review the agenda and the
    objectives/purpose of the breakout session - to develop and reach agreement on process, organization, and technology
    characteristics for all processes within the scope (i.e. Process Orders to Invoice of the Mega-Process Order
    Fulfillment).&nbsp; Once all questions have been addressed, the group will be begin the first exercise, develop the
    characteristics for Order Fulfillment Mega-process.&nbsp; At this point, the facilitator will review the project as
    well as the key conclusions that pertain to processes within Order Fulfillment.
</p>
<p>
    The facilitator will be responsible for leading the discussion on predetermined topics and ensure that all information
    is captured on flip charts and/or by the scribe (a member of the client process team).&nbsp; At the end of each
    breakout, the groups will come back together to present and discuss their design characteristics.&nbsp; A volunteer
    (executive participant) from each group will present their ideas and then the floor will be open for discussion about
    the design.&nbsp; At this point, the session coordinator will begin to highlight those characteristics that the group
    has reached a consensus.&nbsp; The exercise will end with a final review of the To-Be design characteristics agreed to
    by the entire group.
