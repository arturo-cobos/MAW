    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    Every effort has been made to list the essential activities for a smooth transition of product ownership to the
    customer. This strategy addresses steps to take as the implementation approaches and arrives at conclusion. The main
    focus is the handling of issues that arise when concluding a project. There may be other implementations that could
    utilize this document, as some activities may be relevant beyond the specific application started.
</p>There are two kinds of evaluations that occur in projects. Formative Evaluation occurs throughout the project life
cycle and provides information to guide corrective action. This type of evaluation is the building block for customer
relationships, environmental considerations, setting expectations of all involved parties, and maybe most importantly, the
project information. Though completion sign-off relies heavily upon information from this type of evaluation, this topic is
more concerned about Summary Evaluation. Here we focus on the end of the project, when the customer accepts responsibility
of ownership of the product that was produced for them. It is here that a positive lasting impression can be made on the
customer, thus inviting opportunity for future engagements.

</table>Completion Sign-off is a post mortem of performance and deliverables of the project implementation. It can be the
most crucial stage of bringing about additional business, as well as retaining the customer as a reference. It also
provides for an opportunity to improve upon the delivery of future projects at other sites. Most generally it is the
Project Manager (PM) who oversees the Completion Sign-off. The PM must insure that all work is closed out, all issues are
resolved and/or handed over to responsible people on the customer team for follow-up, and all commitments have been met or
compensated for. 
<p>
    It is important that all appropriate information be communicated to the customer and that all documentation be
    delivered in a timely and orderly fashion. This is the final stage of an engagement and all efforts should be made to
    keep it smooth and impressive as possible.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of the Completion Sign-off is to enable successful transition of ownership (or responsibility) to the
    customer team by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identifying a standard methodology for implementation of an asset management product<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Recommend the most effective approach to implementing the desired business product ownership transition<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduce the depth and duration of disruption to the project transition process by imposing consistency and
        direction<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilitating acceptance by ensuring that the transition is well thought out by both the client and the
        implementation team, and that critical success factors are addressed and in place
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Key components of Completion Sign-off are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Document Package<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Knowledge Transfer<br />
    </li>

<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    3.1&nbsp; Document Package
</h4>
<p>
    <u>Introduction</u>
</p>
<p>
    The document package includes the collecting of all existing documentation, status reports and “How-to” documents from
    all practitioners, consultants and analysts who assisted on the project.&nbsp; This should have been an ongoing process
    throughout the life of the project, as documentation should have been collected from each team member as they completed
    their tasks.&nbsp; In addition, all parties on the project team should have submitted weekly status reports.&nbsp; This
    documentation can be used for transition and skill transfer purposes.&nbsp; As such, these documents should provide all
    the necessary information for each completed task.&nbsp; Documentation should be precise, and include machine names,
    scripts, userIDs and passwords, configurations, IP addresses, and all other relevant information whenever
    possible.&nbsp; There should also be step-by-step documentation of how each task was completed. Often this type of
    documentation resembles a user guide.
</p>
<p>
    It is highly recommended to have all documentation complete and packaged at the time of sign-off.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Deliverables</u>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Status reports should be organized alphabetically by task and in chronological order<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        How-to documents should be organized alphabetically by task<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Configuration spreadsheet that lists installed modules, patches, hardware<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Transition team roles<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Outstanding issues document<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Remaining documentation should be organized alphabetically by task and in chronological order
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u>Scheme</u>
</p>
<p>
    <u>Status reports</u> will show what was accomplished during the project.&nbsp; Normally, the members of the project
    team, on a weekly basis, will submit these to the PM or team lead (TL).&nbsp; The TL and/or PM will then review these
    with the customer during weekly status meetings.&nbsp; On occasion, a practitioner who completed their assigned
    deliverable may be asked to attend this meeting before departure from the project.&nbsp; The weekly review will assist
    in controlling issues as they arise, thus ensuring a smooth transition at the time of Completion Sign-off.&nbsp; These
    status meetings will assist in keeping the customer, TL and/or PM current with the project status.&nbsp; This will
    allow progress to stay in alignment with the completion date.&nbsp; This will also provide a mechanism to ensure the
    transition team is in place and prepared to take ownership of the completed product.&nbsp; In addition, these meetings
    will allow the PM, TL and customer to preview what the finished product will resemble before the time of
    transition.&nbsp; This will assure that all expectations will be met at project termination.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <u>How-to:</u>&nbsp; The customer will use the ‘how-to’ documents once they have taken ownership and the project team
    has departed.&nbsp; This documentation will allow the customer to recreate the product in the event that any piece of
    it fails or needs to be duplicated in day-to-day operations.&nbsp; Granularity is important with these documents, they
    will be the tools used to prevent the customer from relying on support for day-to-day tasks.&nbsp; The focus of this
    documentation is to supplement the owner’s manual or installation instructions provided with the product, they are not
    a re-write of them.&nbsp; Because each environment is unique, they offer different challenges and issues that must be
    overcome.&nbsp; So, these documents should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Lessons that were learned while implementing the product in the customer environment<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Configurations that are unique to the customer environment<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Unique tasks associated with day-to-day operations should be covered<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Anything not covered in the product documentation
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u>Configuration spreadsheet workbook</u> document will illustrate the customer environment in relation to hardware and
    software configuration.&nbsp; The workbook will consist of two (2) spreadsheets.&nbsp; The first will be a Patch/Module
    listing and the second will list configuration information.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <em>Patch/Module listing:</em>&nbsp; Format of this spreadsheet will be by populating the left most column with the
    titles:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Name – for Machine name<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Role – the specific role the machine performs within the product<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Hardware -- make and model of each machine<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        OS -- installed operating system (OS)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following rows in the left most column will be populated individually with the names (or aliases) of each:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Installed OS patches<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Product modules<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Product patches
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The intersecting cells for each module/patch listed in the left most column and machine name listed in the top row will
    be populated with the installation date of the patch/module.&nbsp; If the patch/module is not required on a specific
    machine an n/a for ‘not applicable’ will be entered in the appropriate intersecting cell.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <em>Configuration listing</em> information will include the top four (4) rows of the Patch/Module listing discussed
    above.&nbsp; The following rows in the left most column will include, but not be limited to, the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        UserIDs -- and associated rights/privileges.&nbsp;<br />
        o&nbsp;Include permanent IDs used by the application(s) for access to databases, etc.<br />
        o&nbsp;Administrator IDs used for access to the product<br />
        o&nbsp;Temporary IDs used by project personnel for access to the customer environment<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Passwords -- that were changed by the IBM project personnel.&nbsp; These may be included in another document for
        security reasons.&nbsp; The method to change these passwords should also be communicated to the customer before
        departure of project personnel, as they will most likely elect to change them.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ownership -- of these machines (if other than the customer)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Location – country, city, state, building and floor as applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Location access -- requirements and contacts<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        IP -- addresses and network configuration of each of these machines&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        OS local support -- individual(s) and department, contact information<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Local product/module -- support individual(s) and department, contact information<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Hardware configuration -- and inventory information of these machines<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Local hardware support -- individual(s) and department, contact information<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u>Transition Team Roles:</u>&nbsp; A directory of product administration roles and responsibilities should be
    compiled.&nbsp; This document will list and define the various roles that are necessary for the product to function
    seamlessly.&nbsp; At this juncture in the project, all the roles should be filled with qualified personnel.&nbsp; Many
    of them may already be functioning within these roles.&nbsp; This document will also act as a confirmation of
    management’s approval of the customer team responsibilities.&nbsp; At times, individuals and/or supervisors may not
    have fully joined the project effort.&nbsp; This document may serve to illuminate partial buy-in by customer team
    member and/or their respective supervisor.&nbsp; The intended time allowance for the customer team member may not be
    sufficient for satisfactory execution of the newly assumed responsibilities.&nbsp; So, this document can also serve to
    remind the customer of a mismatch between a proposed role of a team member and role expectations and/or
    abilities.&nbsp; The name, department contact information, and backup resource details of each role should be included
    in this document.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Outstanding Issues Document:</u>&nbsp; Any unresolved issues should be listed in an outstanding issues
    document.&nbsp; These are issues that cannot be resolved prior to exit.&nbsp; At a minimum, the information should
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Module name<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Brief problem description<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Description narrative giving detailed information of the issue<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Symptom(s)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Effect on product and/or other modules/applications<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Support vendor problem identification number<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Vendor name, technical lead, contact information<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Notes indicating progress and actions taken thus far,&nbsp; listed by date<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Team member responsible for resolution and contact information
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Any remaining pertinent documentation not mentioned above should also be included in the project documentation
    package.&nbsp; These may include timelines and plans, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    3.2&nbsp; Knowledge Transfer
</h4>
<p>
    <u><strong>Introduction</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
    Many projects fail because of a lack of knowledge transfer.&nbsp; If no one is prepared to use the product, the blame
    will usually reside with the implementing team.&nbsp; If a product is neither fully utilized nor supported with local
    personnel, the blame will most likely reside on the implementers.&nbsp; It could be argued who is at fault.&nbsp;
    Regardless, the resulting view is that a considerable amount of money has been wasted.&nbsp; In addition, no further
    opportunities for project engagements with this customer would be likely in such a scenario.&nbsp; Knowledge transfer
    comes in various flavors.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Objectives</u></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Hands-on<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Informal training sessions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Documentation review
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong><u>Scheme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <u>Hands-on:</u>&nbsp; The ideal environment during the project would allow the customer to work directly with the
    implementor during each phase of the project.&nbsp; This would allow the customer to become more familiar with the
    product, as well as to understand the various issues and remedies.&nbsp; Because the customer is seldom available to
    assist with the implementation, the combination of the product and the project documentation provide a means for the
    customer to achieve the required level of knowledge.&nbsp; This point should highlight the need for granularity in all
    aspects of the documentation that will be given to the customer.&nbsp; The how-to documents are extremely important and
    may be used as a tool in any knowledge transfer that occurs.&nbsp; As the conclusion of the project approaches, a walk
    through of the modules would assist the customer team to once again become familiar with the GUI’s, methods, and
    policies of the product.&nbsp; Often this will be the only time various members of the customer team will be made
    available to familiarize themselves with their responsibilities.&nbsp; Time should be set aside for a high level
    demonstration of the product offerings and abilities.&nbsp; This also allows for an opportunity to show that the
    product is working as promised.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <u>Informal Training Sessions:</u>&nbsp; Some organizations prefer, or even demand, to have training sessions.&nbsp;
    These training sessions should augment rather than replace the formal classroom training offered by various
    vendors.&nbsp; Most generally time does not permit for such training, though if it is provided it should be
    communicated to the customer that the training is meant to augment the formal training.&nbsp; Because the customer
    should be familiar with the information in the user’s guides and manuals at this point, the how-to docs may be valuable
    here.&nbsp; Again, these will be the documents that the customer will use once the project has been completed.&nbsp; It
    should be communicated that the final version of the docs will be in the document package.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <u>Documentation Review:</u>&nbsp; At a minimum, the how-to documents should be reviewed with the individual(s)
    responsible for the associated piece of the product so that they are familiar with, and have a copy of this
    documentation.&nbsp; Once the module is complete, the respective how-to document should be completed and submitted to
    the responsible individuals for that module.&nbsp; A second copy should be delivered to the PM for inclusion in the
    final document package.&nbsp; It should be communicated to the customer team that, in the event of any changes, the
    final version of the document will be included in the document package at the conclusion of the project.&nbsp; Effort
    should be made to provide the final versions of these documents to each appropriate member of the customer team at the
    conclusion of the project to ensure they have an updated version.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    3.3&nbsp; Transition Team Management
</h4>
<p>
    <strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is extremely important that each member of the customer team knows their respective responsibilities and how they
    relate to the product roles.&nbsp; Many of the individuals will have already assumed their respective roles once the
    project has neared completion.&nbsp; It is important that everyone is aware of his or her roles with this new product
    before the rollout team exits the site.&nbsp; This will contribute greatly towards the success of the project.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Deliverables/Objectives</u></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Spreadsheet illustrating roles<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Transition Meeting with customer
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong><u>Scheme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <u>Spreadsheet:</u>&nbsp; The purpose of the spreadsheet listing is to illustrate the customer transition team.&nbsp;
    It will indicate the various job functions required by the product.&nbsp; These functions will need to be defined
    therewith thus indicating the required technical and/or administrative trait for that role or function.&nbsp; This will
    serve as a high-level indicator of the requirements for each position/role.&nbsp; The primary and secondary individuals
    for each role will also be listed, along with their respective contact information.&nbsp; This document will serve to
    illustrate the individual, role, description and requirement, thus possibly suggesting to the customer the quality of
    fit.&nbsp; Another function of this document will be for contact purposes, as well as backfilling the positions in the
    future.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <u>Transition Meeting:</u>&nbsp; During an arranged Transition Meeting, this spreadsheet will be presented to the
    customer to show that the transition team is in place and aware of their respective responsibilities.&nbsp; Any
    concerns of mismatches may be discussed at this time.&nbsp; The purpose of the transition meeting is an informative one
    and not for reassignment of responsibilities.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to encourage success of the project after
    the implementation team has exited by ensuring a superior customer team is in place and prepared to assume ownership of
    the product.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<h4>
    3.4&nbsp; Product Demonstration
</h4>
<p>
    <strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the product demonstration is three-fold:&nbsp; (1) to demonstrate that the product functions as
    specified and meets all objectives; (2) to point out that any subsequent changes made in the customer environment, or
    in the product itself, may result in the successfully installed hardware and/or software to be partially or fully
    disabled; and (3) to use the demonstration as an opportunity to discuss areas for future engagements.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Objectives</u></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Demonstrate a working product<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Discussion of pending issues<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore opportunity for future engagements
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <u><strong>Scheme</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
    <u>Demonstrate the product:</u>&nbsp; Because changes in the environment may render the product inactive, we want to
    show the customer a working product before departure.&nbsp; An effort should be made to perform a somewhat high-level
    demonstration of each piece of equipment or module individually.&nbsp; It will be the responsibility of the PM or a
    designee to perform each demonstration.&nbsp; It is suggested that the implementing member of the team conduct the
    demonstration.&nbsp; This person has the knowledge of the hardware or module as well as the uniqueness of the customer
    environment that the hardware or module resides in.&nbsp; The objective is to show the customer that the implementation
    is complete and successful.
</p>
<p>
    Ways in which the specific product has satisfied the needs of the customer should be highlighted.&nbsp; These results
    are defined as requisite and bonus.&nbsp; Requisite results are those for which the product was purchased.&nbsp; Lists
    of these results were compiled at the beginning of the project and should be brought into the demonstration.&nbsp; It
    is important to show how each of them has satisfactorily addressed the need that was identified at the beginning of the
    project.&nbsp; Somewhat more importantly are the bonus results.&nbsp; These are needs we have discovered while working
    in the customer environment that the customer did not anticipate.&nbsp; Bonus results were exposed in status reports,
    other documentation, and through discussions with team members.&nbsp; The implementer will have detailed knowledge of
    the bonus results.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <u>Discussion of Pending Issues:</u>&nbsp; Discussion of outstanding issues for each product should take place at this
    time.&nbsp; If agreeable, the customer will need to accept responsibility to arrive at a solution, and sign-off on the
    product as-is.&nbsp; The responsible customer team member for this issue should already have been made aware of the
    problem and have all the information from the Outstanding Issues Document (see step 3.1 above).&nbsp; A copy of this
    document will be included in the document package.&nbsp; The name of the individual responsible for this issue will
    have been included in the outstanding issues document.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <u>Explore Opportunities:</u>&nbsp; High-level discussion for potential future engagements should be expanded during
    this meeting.&nbsp; While demonstrating successful completion of the current project, there is opportunity to study
    future engagements.&nbsp; The demonstration method should show the customer areas of opportunity, thus giving rise to
    other contract opportunities.&nbsp; Methods to resolve other needs discovered in the customer environment should be
    mentioned and expanded upon as well.&nbsp; These needs should have been communicated to the PM or TL while the project
    was executed.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    3.5&nbsp; Sign-off
</h5>
<p>
    <u><strong>Introduction</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
    This is the final step of the transition.&nbsp; It is important that the customer sign-off on each piece or module of
    the product.&nbsp; At this juncture, the customer understands that each piece is working and free from defects.&nbsp;
    The customer will also understand and accept any outstanding issues.&nbsp; Once accepted, the customer assumes
    responsibility for support and modifications of that module.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Objectives</u></strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customer sign-off and acceptance of each module<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        End of Engagement document
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong><u>Schema</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The product demonstration steps above should be concurred with the sign-off list.&nbsp; As each piece of the tool is
    demonstrated, customer acceptance should be obtained.&nbsp; It is at this point the customer will sign-off and accept
    the implementation.&nbsp; Support and modification will be the responsibility of the customer transition team from this
    point forward.&nbsp; This process will be exercised for each component of the implementation until the entire product
    has been turned over to the customer.&nbsp;

<p>
    The End of Engagement document should be discussed and submitted to the customer for completion.&nbsp;
