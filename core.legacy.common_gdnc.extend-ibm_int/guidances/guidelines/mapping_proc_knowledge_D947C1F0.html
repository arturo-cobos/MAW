    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    A Knowledge Map describes what knowledge is used in a process, and how it flows around the process. It is the basis for
    determining knowledge commonality, or areas where similar knowledge is used across multiple processes. It is the first
    step in defining a high-level corporate taxonomy and common language.
</p>
<p>
    If more than one process has been looked at in this stage, we should be able to look at any knowledge commonality
    between processes, and depending on where these processes occur, between different parts of the organization. This can
    also be mapped, showing the bigger KM picture. It may be that extending a KM pilot to cover more than one part of the
    organization may show significantly bigger benefits to keeping it in a single area. Understanding how knowledge is
    shared around an organization enables organizational learning. Maximum benefits can be obtained by encouraging
    inter-departmental or inter-process sharing of information and knowledge. We understand which part of the process
    knowledge and information is created and used. In many cases this may be across processes or departments.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Purpose
</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of Process Knowledge Mapping is to understand current core processes and the knowledge resources needed to
    execute them; to identify the “focal points” of initiatives and projects.&nbsp; The output will serve as input to
    generate a list of potential initiatives or projects, and form the foundation for gap analysis.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Review critical processes.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the individual process steps within each process.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the knowledge required to fulfill the purpose of each step.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the knowledge generated (if any) for each process step.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create measurement criteria for each critical process step.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze the process maps
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Step 1 – Review Critical Processes
</h4>
<p>
    Processes are identified and agreed upon prior to Process Knowledge Mapping.&nbsp; During a joint session of the IBM
    and client teams, core processes are reviewed.&nbsp; The purpose of this step is to confirm that the listed processes
    are uniformly understood, and critical to the client’s success.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 – Identify the individual process steps, and their purpose, within each process.
</h4>
<p>
    As with the first step, this may have been accomplished during the process definition phase.&nbsp; Each step in the
    process is identified and recorded.&nbsp; A step is generally defined by its purpose, e.g. make decision about xxx, or
    collect data on xxx, etc.&nbsp; Considerable time may be spent ensuring that the correct purpose is assigned to each
    step, as this eventually serves as the basis for aligning specific knowledge items with each process step.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 – Identify the knowledge required to fulfill the purpose of each step.
</h4>
<p>
    Now that each step in the process has a unique purpose, the focus shifts to the specific knowledge that is required to
    fulfill that purpose. Either the joint IBM/client team can determine the knowledge required by brainstorming, or they
    can conduct interviews with the process owners.<br />
    Categorize the knowledge as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Tacit knowledge = expertise in people's heads<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Social capital = trust, interpersonal relationships, cultural norms<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Infrastructure = processes, tools, roles & responsibilities, incentives, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 4 – Identify the knowledge generated (if any) for each step.
</h4>
<p>
    To understand where knowledge is gained in the process, brainstorm and identify knowledge that is generated during each
    process step.&nbsp; This will serve as a portion of the baseline for As-Is analysis, or what knowledge already exists
    in the organization.
</p>
<p>
    Next, identify the focal points for each step in the process.&nbsp; Focal points are process steps/knowledge
    resources/knowledge generated with a great deal of variability.&nbsp; These, in total, show a picture of the critical
    knowledge path for each process.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 5 – Create measurement criteria for each critical process step.
</h4>
<p>
    It is imperative to determine how we will know that the process has been completed successfully.&nbsp; For the focal
    points listed previously, or the process as a whole, identify how to measure process performance / effectiveness
    (brainstorm and capture on flip charts).
</p>
<h4>
    Step 6 – Analyze the process maps
</h4>
<p>
    Review completed process maps; for each process step, review the knowledge resources and determine:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Do we leverage this today?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the knowledge available and accessible to everyone who needs it?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Are decisions made with all the right knowledge?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Where should we focus our improvement efforts?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Summarize the analysis:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Create list of key strengths (things we do well should continue)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create list of key opportunities for improvement (things we need to fix), and expected benefits
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Document summary on flip charts<br />
</p>
<p>
    If analysis is done in sub-groups, each sub-group presents to the full team
</p>
