    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    To understand the "real" flow of information in organization for successful implementations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Social network
    analysis (SNA) is an approach to understanding social structures.&nbsp; The SNA framework is rooted in anthropology,
    sociology and social psychology.&nbsp; While the level of analytical (mathematical) rigor and complexity has increased
    dramatically over the years, social network analysis, at its core, remains a clear and useful tool for explaining human
    actions.
</p>
<p>
    Many executives invest a considerable amount of resources in restructuring their companies, drawing and redrawing
    organizational charts only to be disappointed by the results.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is because much of the real work of
    companies happens despite the formal organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often what needs attention is the informal organization,
    the networks of relationships that employees form across functions and divisions to accomplish tasks fast.&nbsp; These
    informal relationships can cut through formal reporting procedures to jump start stalled initiatives and meet
    extraordinary deadlines.&nbsp; But informal networks can just as easily sabotage companies' best laid plans by blocking
    communication and fomenting opposition to change unless managers know how to identify and direct them.&nbsp; Learning
    how to map these social links can help managers harness the real power in their companies and revamp their formal
    organizations to let the informal ones thrive.
</p>
<p>
    Using network analysis, managers can translate a myriad of relationship ties into maps that show how the informal
    organization gets work done.&nbsp; Managers can get a good overall picture by diagramming three types of relationships:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The advice network show the prominent players in an organization on whom others depend to solve problems and
        provide technical information.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The trust network tells which employees share delicate political information and back one another up in a
        crisis.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The communication network reveals the employees who talk about work –related matters on a regular basis
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The SNA framework views all social systems, including organizations, as arrangements (networks) of objects or
    structural positions joined by various relationships (e.g., work exchange, knowledge transfer, communication,
    trust).&nbsp; The central tenet of social network analysis is the somewhat obscure idea of structure.&nbsp; Within
    organizations, structure typically is regarded as the boxes and lines that are depicted in an organizational
    chart.&nbsp; While this picture might describe formal reporting relationships or high-level divisions within an
    organization, most people probably would agree that the activities that support and define the organization are not
    captured in such a simplistic model.
</p>
<p>
    The SNA view of structure emphasizes the non-random (repeated or patterned) relationships that exist within
    organizations.&nbsp; This focus is reflected best in network diagrams or maps.&nbsp; Here, an organization (or
    sub-unit) is perceived as a social space where distances (measured with various forms of data) between network nodes
    (people) connote structural position and meaning.&nbsp; Position, relative to others, helps explain member and group
    identification as well as provides explanations for the way people behave.&nbsp; In fact, an important component of
    this framework is the idea that people close in network position maintain similar perceptions of the
    organization.&nbsp; Likewise, people at extreme (distant) network positions do not perceive the same organizational
    events equally.<br />
    People not familiar with network ideas often have difficulty making the association between structural position and
    reported similarities (or dissimilarities) among individuals (i.e., perceptions, interests, and motivations).&nbsp;
    However, a substantial body of research has verified these connections.&nbsp; Indeed, many researchers contend that
    interaction enables the shared (similar) perception of issues and ideas.&nbsp; Thus, people engaged in repeated
    interactions are more likely to view organizational events similarly since their likelihood of exchanging meaningful
    information is greater.&nbsp; This is why repeated (non-random) interactions are central to the SNA view of structure
    and worthy of organizational diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
    This idea is critical to organizational knowledge and the creation of learning systems.&nbsp; Organizational learning
    generally is differentiated from individual learning by the act of collaboration.&nbsp; In other words, organizational
    learning is dependent on ideas being disseminated and retained throughout the organization.&nbsp; It has been shown
    that a person’s willingness to collaborate (thus enabling or preventing organizational knowledge) depends on the
    identification with other people to whom they are interdependent.&nbsp; Positive (knowledge enabling) identification
    with others occurs through the exchange (i.e., interaction) of salient information, thereby reducing the threats
    (fears) associated with exposing one’s self via the offering of personal thoughts and ideas.
</p>
<p>
    A frequently overlooked component of SNA diagnoses is why various interactions are (or are not) occurring in an
    organization.&nbsp; In other words, what are the causes and consequences of existing interaction patterns (structure),
    and, are there interactions that could benefit organizational performance?&nbsp; Again, efforts to improve
    organizational knowledge, learning and innovation are greatly dependent on interaction patterns.&nbsp; Understanding
    the drivers of certain interactions can facilitate systemic changes such as those associated with process improvements
    (alterations), knowledge sharing, and the shift to flexible work teams.

<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understand the nodes, gatekeepers, and influences in an organization for implementation.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand how information actually flows in organizations.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand which employees might cause the most risk if they left the company.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand the implications for job rotations, transfers or reassignments.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify the practice group or community who will be analyzed and obtain top management support of the
        survey.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Define 1 5 questions to be analyzed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following are the questions most frequently asked:&nbsp;<br />
        - &nbsp;Who people talk to every day?&nbsp;<br />
        - &nbsp;Who do they seek advice from at least once a week?&nbsp;<br />
        -&nbsp; Who would they rely on to support a proposal that could be unpopular?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        - &nbsp;Who would they trust to keep in confidence their concerns about a work related issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        - &nbsp;With one day of training, whose job would they step into?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Distribute the survey to the group. (Approximately 100% return rate is required.)&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Input responses in one of several software products which support the analysis (rely on the your Subject Matter
        Expert is most familiar with).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyze the results with Subject Matter Expert.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Present results to management.
    </li>
</ol>
