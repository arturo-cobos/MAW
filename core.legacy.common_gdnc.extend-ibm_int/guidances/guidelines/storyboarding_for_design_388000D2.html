    1&nbsp;Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Stories and Storyboards are valuable tools in the sale, specification, design, implementation, and introduction of
    Knowledge Management solutions. They focus attention on the people who will use the solution and the value it will
    bring. Stories are rich, fleshed-out descriptions of settings, people, activities, goals, motivations, and values
    presented in a coherent, causally connected way. The process of creating a story can insure that attention has been
    paid to the factors necessary to create an effective solution.
</p>
<p>
    Because stories capture in detail the real-world context in which a new technology will be used, they help determine
    which functions will be useful, how they should be presented, and what integration with other tools, people, and
    information will be important. Stories can be highly effective tools for communicating to others problems with current
    work processes and the value of new functionalities being proposed. Stories are useful with multidisciplinary or
    cross-organizational teams because they tend to serve as a "common language" that spans differences in background and
    organizational status and focuses attention on the people who will use the system (a constituency often absent from
    many design discussions). Stories are particularly valuable for conveying the benefits of Knowledge Management systems
    whose full value is not in any single user task or set of screens, but in the real world collaboration and information
    sharing they enable among the people who use them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Stories are more than simple “use-case” scenarios.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Scenarios around a technological artifact typically focus on the way a system is used to perform a specific task, but
    often do not include detailed descriptions of the people involved in a task, or their motivations, values and
    goals.&nbsp; Scenarios can vary greatly in level of detail but are often quite generic.
</p>
<p>
    Stories, on the other hand, are by nature specific, with fleshed-out characters and settings, dramatic elements,
    well-formed plotlines, and enough detail to understand the people who will use a system and the value it will bring to
    their lives.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reasons for using stories and storyboards include:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Anchoring design in end use<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Promoting innovation by capturing the problems people face in a real world domain<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Conveying functionality of a proposed solution, product or service<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Convincing people of the value of a proposed product in a real-world domain, and, by analogy, that it would be
        valuable in their own settings<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Collecting requirements and generating feedback on how the events and functionalities depicted in the story map to
        the intended domain.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Helping people to understand how they could incorporate a new technology in their own work practice and recognize
        the value of doing so<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Promoting “Due Diligence” by insuring that the factors required for a successful KM solution and user experience
        have been considered.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    This document outlines the steps required to create effective storyboards.&nbsp; These include determining the audience
    and goals of the storyboard, selecting a setting and characters, choosing key events and actions, structuring the
    pieces into a compelling narrative with a meaningful plot, determining a presentation style, and, finally, crafting the
    final storyboard.
</p>
<p>
    The sequence and steps followed to create a specific storyboard can vary.&nbsp; For example, if you are creating a
    story to explore customer requirements, you will likely begin from descriptions of the customer setting, characters and
    issues.&nbsp; If you are crafting a story to illustrate the value of an existing or proposed product, you will
    generally start by itemizing the functions, capabilities, and benefits you will want to convey.&nbsp; (Much of this
    document focuses on stories crafted from this perspective: illustrating the use of a system and conveying its value.)
    The process of storyboard construction generally involves a lot of iteration.&nbsp; Changes in plot, for example, can
    lead to modifications to your characters or to the events and system capabilities you will want to show.&nbsp; The
    process outlined here is one we have found effective, but it is by no means the only way to create a storyboard.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A Caveat</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Crafting an effective story is both a skill and an art.&nbsp; For stories to be maximally effective, they must include
    many of the same narrative elements that contribute to a compelling novel, short story, or movie.&nbsp; In practice
    this means that teams using stories as a design tool should include participants with talent, experience or skill in
    crafting stories.&nbsp; Fortunately, we have found that people can learn to be better storytellers and story crafters
    through practice, training, and by reading books on stories, film, and narrative to become sensitive to the elements
    that lead to effective stories.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    <font size="3"><strong>Step 1 – Determine the Goals and Audience</strong></font>
</p>
<p>
    Determine why you are creating the story and for whom it is being created.&nbsp; What specifically do you want the
    audience to learn from the story?&nbsp; What impression do you want them to have?
</p>
<p>
    The goals may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Explaining a specific functionality<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Convincing that a proposed solution would provide value, as part of a sales presentation<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Illustrating a proposed design to gather feedback<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Eliciting requirements by having target users describe in detail situations analogous to those shown in the
        storyboard<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Initiating a brainstorming or design session aimed at devising solutions to the problems faced by the people in the
        story<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="3"><strong>Step 2 - Determine the Starting Point: The Features, Activities, or Domain the Story Will
    Explore</strong></font>
</p>
<p>
    If you are crafting a story to demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of a particular system, either existing or
    proposed, start by listing the specific features you will want to be sure to show.&nbsp; What benefits of using the
    system will you want your story to illustrate?&nbsp; Examples of capabilities include “seamless integration with other
    tools”, “the ability to quickly check on current inventory”, and “access from wireless devices”.&nbsp; Examples of
    benefits include “better handling of customer service calls”, “quicker response to problems”, and “more expert
    decisions.”
</p>
<p>
    If you are crafting a story to motivate the design of a specific new solution, start by itemizing the general tasks and
    activities you will want the system to support. These can include such items as “calendaring and scheduling” or “joint
    editing of documents.”&nbsp; Then expand them to reflect the values of the target users, and the broader implications
    of the tasks in realizing the users’ goals.
</p>
<p>
    If you are crafting a story to inspire innovation aimed at defining visions for new products or services, start by
    selecting a general domain.&nbsp; The goal of the story will be to richly capture the values, goals, activities, and
    problems experienced by the people in a setting you will choose.&nbsp; The plot of the story should rise naturally from
    the people and the setting, capturing their “pain” and thereby revealing opportunities for new solutions.
</p>
<p>
    <font size="3"><strong>Step 3 – Select a General Setting</strong></font>
</p>
<p>
    Compelling stories include details of time and place, helping the audience situate themselves in the setting in which
    the story takes place.&nbsp; When designing a solution or product, it is important to understand the overall
    environment in which a tool or system will be used, and the other artifacts and activities with which it must fit.
</p>
<p>
    If you are crafting a story to capture details of a specific customer and situation, you will generally base the choice
    of setting on observation and research of the customer site.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, you will want to choose a
    setting from scratch.&nbsp; Some stories are created around a general product or functionality being designed for broad
    user group, with no single customer in mind.&nbsp; Also, when a story is being used to elicit general feedback and
    requirements early in an engagement, showing a storyboard from a domain other than the customer’s can focus attention
    on the broader capabilities being discussed.&nbsp; This can lead to more “open-ended” discussion, instead of focusing
    on the specific details that happened to be included in the story.
</p>
<p>
    Your story should accurately reflect issues that arise in the real world.&nbsp; If you are not familiar with the
    setting at the outset, do the necessary research until you know it well.&nbsp; Visit settings like the one in your
    story, and observe and interview the people who work there.&nbsp; Ask them to tell describe specific experiences
    involving the themes you care about; the anecdotes they tell you will suggest characters and events for your
    story.<br />
    It is generally important to select a setting that is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Relevant<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Seen as important and respectable<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Generalizable<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Mainstream (not a fringe or atypical use)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Understandable to the people you will show it to, and not full of esoteric technical details<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Familiar to you, so the story rings true even to people who work in that domain.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Often, core profit making business
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The tasks and capabilities you wish to show will help guide your choice of settings.&nbsp; For example, a story written
    around a tool that allows large-scale collaboration and includes language translation would suggest choosing a large,
    multinational corporation as the setting.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><font size="3">Step 4 - Determine Protagonists</font></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Create a protagonist and other key participants.&nbsp; These should be typical of the intended users in terms of
    experience, training, job, goals, motivations, and other descriptive details.&nbsp; They should also be representative
    of the domain expertise and familiarity with computers and other tools and resources that people in the domain
    typically have.&nbsp; It is important to conceive of your protagonists as real, fleshed-out, human characters.&nbsp;
    Understanding what is important to them, what motivates them and what they fear, where they have been and where they
    want to go, will insure that they behave believably and that the systems you design to support them will seem
    natural.&nbsp; A good way to accomplish this is to go out, interview several people in the domain, and base your
    characters loosely on them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><font size="3">Step 5 - Select an Overall Activity and Goal</font></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Choose an overall activity and set of goals that will form the basis of your story’s plot.&nbsp; What is the general
    activity in which your protagonist is engaged?&nbsp; What is the protagonist trying to accomplish?&nbsp; Once you have
    determined the overall activity and goals, think about the problems that could arise and what the protagonist would
    need to overcome them.&nbsp; This will help you clarify what obstacles will the proposed system help the protagonist
    overcome, and why doing so is important?&nbsp; An overall activity and goal might be “designing a strategy for a new
    product launch”, or “selling a piece of real estate.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong><font size="3">Step 6 - Generate Events</font></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Generate events to illustrate the capabilities you want to convey, using the setting, protagonists, goals, activity,
    and problems you specified above as a guide.&nbsp; Brainstorm to create a list of alternatives from which you will
    choose as you iron out the plot.&nbsp; Examples of events are “Bill uses his PDA to locate a nearby supplier”, or
    “Kim’s flight is cancelled so she needs to participate in a critical meeting remotely.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong><font size="3">Step 7 - Combine Events into a Script</font></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Begin stringing the events together into a coherent plot.&nbsp; Select from the events you listed in the previous step,
    and order them in a way that makes sense.&nbsp; Be sensitive to the flow and pacing of the story.&nbsp; Feel free to
    modify the events to fit the plot, or to change other details of the activity as you proceed.&nbsp; Just be sure the
    events and activity remain representative of the setting and protagonist.
</p>
<p>
    <font size="3"><strong>Step 8 - Review with Domain Experts</strong></font>
</p>
<p>
    Review the story with experts, both those familiar with the setting and domain, and those familiar with the
    system.&nbsp; Is the story believable?&nbsp; Are the terminology and other details correct?&nbsp; Does it reflect the
    issues that really arise?&nbsp; How should the story be changed to make it more realistic, or more compelling?&nbsp; It
    is useful to have such expert feedback throughout the story construction process.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><font size="3">Step 9 - Determine a Style and Medium</font></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Decide on a style for rendering and presenting the story.&nbsp; This can range from a simple textual story in prose, to
    a full movie-like production.&nbsp; Other options include showing a series of static illustrations or screen-shots with
    verbal narration, self-running animations, interactive presentations with printed scripts, Director or Shockwave
    movies, and slides for a presentation graphics program.&nbsp; Consider the intended effect, the situations in which the
    story will be presented, the audience, and the delivery mechanisms (Viewed over the Web? A file sent by email?&nbsp; A
    CD-Rom or DVD? A presentation in front of a large audience?)&nbsp; Will the story be given to others to show as part of
    a larger presentation?
</p>
<p>
    <strong><font size="3">Step 10 – Rough Storyboard the Script</font></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Determine the critical scenes you will show.&nbsp; Iterate during this step to be sure the sequence of images you are
    planning to present leads to a storyboard that is understandable, moves smoothly, and focuses the audience’s attention
    on the key elements.&nbsp; It is generally useful to sketch out the scenes in a rough form, and test them with the
    script to be sure it flows.&nbsp; At this stage, you will also consider the design of the interface elements you will
    show.
</p>
<p>
    We often create a table at this point, with a row representing each individual scene.&nbsp; Columns include brief story
    bullets that label the scene, the narrative, the specific functionalities and benefits being depicted, a screen sketch,
    a description of any interactivity, animation or effects, and other miscellaneous notes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><font size="3">Step 11 - Create Screens</font></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Design and produce the specific images, screens, animations and effects that will visually represent the
    storyboard.&nbsp; Depending on the choices you made regarding presentation style and medium, the tools used at this
    stage can include: word-processing software, graphics and imaging tools like Photoshop, animation software such as
    Director or Flash, presentation software, and sound recording and video production tools.
</p>
<p>
    Review the story with the screens for clarity and overall flow.&nbsp; Are the transitions smooth and
    understandable?&nbsp; Are the interface actions clear?&nbsp; Often adding a screen or two (such as showing the
    intermediate state of a menu or other onscreen control) can contribute greatly to the overall flow.&nbsp; Run through
    the story and narration with others to uncover areas that are confusing.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Using the Story
</h3>
<p>
    You can use the storyboard you created in a variety of ways throughout the lifecycle of a project.&nbsp; In addition to
    supporting each phase, the storyboard can serve as the glue that keeps the team focused on what they are building, for
    whom they are building it, and what the system is meant to accomplish.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For Initial Sales</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Because stories reveal the end value that a system will provide, they can be effective sales tools.&nbsp; Stories help
    potential customers understand what the technical features of the system will really mean from the user’s
    perspective.&nbsp; They can be useful in generating discussion on particulars as prospects map the situations in the
    stories to their own domains.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For Requirements Gathering</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Storyboards can be highly effective tools for generating requirements.&nbsp; Hearing a story reminds people of similar
    situations they have experienced in the past.&nbsp; Show the storyboard to potential users of the system you are
    building.&nbsp; Ask for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        General feedback and reactions to the story and the system it depicts.&nbsp; Could they see themselves using such a
        system?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Situations the story brings to mind that they have encountered in the past.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Situations in which they could imagine using the depicted system.&nbsp; How well would the system fit their
        needs?&nbsp; What would have to be changed?&nbsp; Probe for detailed descriptions of these situations, as they can
        form the basis for additional stories that capture more aspects of the target setting.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>For Design</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The process of creating a storyboard helps designers put themselves in the shoes and setting of the people for whom
    they are designing.&nbsp; It often prompts invention and ingenuity as problems end-users encounter are recognized and
    opportunities to solve them are devised.
</p>
<p>
    The story can serve as a “user experience testbed” as prototypes are developed and critiqued.&nbsp; Take a proposed
    design for the system, and run through the story imagining the protagonist using it.&nbsp; Does the system solve the
    problems the protagonist encounters? Does it “fit in” with the story and the protagonist’s environment?&nbsp; Does the
    solution provide the intended value to the people in the story?&nbsp; What changes to the system should be made so it
    does?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For System Rollout</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is often hard for users to understand how and why they should use a new system.&nbsp; Even if they understand how a
    system works, they often fail to recognize situations in which they could use it to further their work.&nbsp; Seeing a
    story showing the system used in a detailed real-world setting helps people map the capabilities of the tool to their
    own domain.&nbsp; The story you created can help introduce people to the system and be incorporated into training
    materials.
</p>
