    1&nbsp;Report Creation Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The final report is the key client deliverable in a consulting engagement and is a continuation of the issue-based
    consulting process. It is important that the structuring of the final report begins early in the engagement. This will
    serve to focus the engagement team on the client objectives and issues and add to the efficiency of the work effort.
</p>
<p>
    The synthesis and analysis of information gathered through interviews, focus groups, observations or client
    documentation drive the content of the final report. This information will test the working hypotheses developed for
    the engagement thereby deriving conclusions. Recommendations can then be generated based on these conclusions which
    have a strong logical tie to the facts and findings uncovered in the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    The objective of the final report is to cause the client to act based upon the clear, concise and logical presentation
    of recommendations to address his issues. Therefore it is essential that the report be written with an action-oriented
    tone and a sense of urgency.
</p>
<p>
    Quality report writing must follow an exacting and rigorous discipline of conception, design writing, and rewriting and
    checking, after the preliminary thinking and data analysis has been completed.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb 25% of the time
    allocated to the engagement will be spent on report writing to fulfill this tedious and time-consuming but necessary
    process.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context of Use

<h3>
    4&nbsp;Report Creation Stages of Consulting Process
</h3>
<h4>
    4.1 Step four: Synthesis
</h4>
<p>
    After the facts have been gathered, they have to be synthesized before they can be used for analysis. The initial steps
    of this stage are somewhat mechanical and simple. Each individual element of data gather must be sorted back to the
    question, which triggered its collection. These facts are then classified, sequenced and summarized by comparison with
    key and check questions to become findings. A finding is a pattern or aggregation of facts, which support a single
    point. Findings summarize several facts; they do not interpret the information or explain possible implications and our
    often obtain by math rather than by judgment. It is critical that the findings be able to stand up to any test of
    validity since it is the foundation of the problem solving logic from which conclusions and recommendations will be
    derived.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="502" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/report_creating_fig3.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
    These findings should then be synthesized and integrated into the issue diagram where they are then used to test
    hypotheses. As the hypotheses are either accepted or modified they become conclusions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the
    initial synthesis process, which tends to be somewhat mechanical, the deriving of conclusions is dependent upon the
    judgment and insights of the consultants. The purposes of conclusions are to interpret what is meant by one ore more
    findings, and dramatically communicate the impact on the client’s operation.
</p>
<p>
    The test of an effective conclusion is how well it answers the ‘so what?’ question about the findings that support it.
    If the conclusion does not answer the ‘so what?’ question, it effectively weakens the logical linkage and impact of
    your recommendations and therefore should be reworked or discarded. These conclusions are then used to revise the
    initial report storyboard key messages and headlines that were created using the working hypotheses during the
    structuring stage of the engagement (see figure 3).&nbsp; In addition, these synthesized facts, findings and
    conclusions should be constructed into a logic diagram to ensure that the conclusions and recommendations are logically
    supported (see figures 4,5).
</p>
<p>
    The process of developing recommendations is the most creative phase of the process. Based on the derived conclusions
    the engagement team should develop several alternate recommendations to address the problem or manifest the opportunity
    uncovered in the conclusion. For each of the recommendations developed, the engagement team should identify its
    benefits and position it against client constraints. The issue and logic diagrams should be referred to throughout the
    entire process to ensure that all client issues for the engagement are being addressed, and that there is strong
    logical linkage from issues to recommendations.

<h5>
    4.1.1 Report Structure and Syntax
</h5>
<p>
    The preliminary structure of the report is established early in the engagement when the working hypotheses have been
    established. Overall the report will have a top down structure with the main idea of the report broken down into
    supporting chapters. The chapters contain landscape pages with headlines that initially are the working hypotheses with
    the outline for supporting details as the body of the page (see figure 6).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong><img height="369" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/report_creating_fig6.JPG" width="525" /></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 6</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The hypotheses serve as placeholders for the headlines for each chart that will be the conclusion derived from the
    engagement with the supporting findings in the body. This layout for report writing is the prevailing standard for
    interim and final reports, and provides both vertical and horizontal logic. Vertical logic is intra page pyramid logic
    where the details in the body of the page serve as support of the headline for the page. Horizontal logic is inter page
    logic where the headlines between pages are interconnected and ideally could serve as an executive summary and the
    story line of the report when read sequentially.
</p>
<p>
    Headlines should be full sentences that summarizes and provides the ‘so what’ of the page. The detail of the page can
    be full sentences, phrases or graphics that fully explains why the headline is true.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the horizontal
    and vertical logic of the report should be should be constantly revisited as the report is being developed to ensure
    that the story line is solid and the supporting details are relevant and valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below are some questions
    that should be asked when checking report logic:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Can you articulate a strategy for structuring your report?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Have you set context?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do your headlines present ideas/conclusions, rather than introduce topics discussed on the rest of the page?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do you indicate the relationship between headlines in transitions?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do your headlines flow logically and linguistically<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do you end with major conclusions, recommendations, and/or next steps?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Where possible the use of graphics to depict supporting details should be considered to enhance the communications of
    ideas.
</p>
<h4>
    4.2 Step five: Buy in
</h4>
<p>
    The objectives of the presentation of the final report to the client is to,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Effectively communicate engagement conclusions and recommendations<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Gain client acceptance of engagement results<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cause client to take action on recommendations
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In preparation for delivering final report it is important that there is a clear understanding of how best to present
    information to client considering such things as presentation preferences, need for detail or brevity, prior awareness
    of engagement results, key action motivators or inhibitors, etc. In addition, figure 7 depicts some fundamental
    presentation considerations.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 7</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As part of the data synthesis process it is important that a system for organizing, storing and retrieving data is
    deployed at the beginning of this process. To assist in the development and data management of issues, hypotheses and
    questions the SCI Issue Analyzer Tool has been developed. For further information regarding this tool please review SCI
    Issue Analyzer Tool Guide technique paper.

<h3>
    5&nbsp;Education
</h3>
<p>
    Before using Issue-Based consulting in a client engagement we recommend that you attend either PCW - Professional
    Consulting Workshop or XPCW - Experienced Professional Consulting Workshop to obtain a complete education on
    issue-based consulting.
