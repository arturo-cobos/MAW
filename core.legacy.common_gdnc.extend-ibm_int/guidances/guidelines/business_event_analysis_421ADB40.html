    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    Business Events are the set of triggers that initiate activity within the enterprise and the Business Event Analysis
    technique is used to identify and define these major "events". This technique is most often used to define the key
    events which are of strategic business importance and which trigger the desired capabilities to be initiated. For
    example, in a B2B (Business – to – Business) environment, the focus would be on the key events that trigger major
    interactions and a transaction between business partners e.g. Procurement and ERP interactions.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Business Event:</strong> something that happens, most often outside the enterprise, which causes the enterprise
    to respond in some way. This response will take the form of a sequence of business activities, the exact sequence being
    determined by business rules.<br />
    Business Event Analysis, as a technique, can be used at the strategy, enterprise-level architecture and the individual
    project level.

    At the project level, the events need to be identified at their most elementary, (i.e. be discrete), whilst as part of
    an EA (Enterprise-level Architecture) engagement, the events can be "high-level" and contain several elementary events.
    For example, at the architectural level, we may only be interested in the event "Student applies for place on course".
    At the project level this event would be expanded to cover several elementary events such as "Student provisionally
    applies for course", "Student confirms his/her application", "Student modifies their application", "Student enquires on
    details of course", "Student Cancels application", "Student defers application", etc.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    The technique has two main steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify Business Events
    </li>
    <li>
        Define and Document Business Events
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Identify Business Events</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This step focuses on the initial identification and validation of the major business events. Three types of event are
    recognized; "external",&nbsp; "internal" and "temporal" events.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>External events</strong> are those occurrences that take place outside the enterprise and which require a
        response from the enterprise. Examples of external events are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Customer places Order.
            </li>
            <li>
                Person applies to open account,
            </li>
            <li>
                Policyholder makes a claim,
            </li>
            <li>
                Student withdraws from course.&nbsp;<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Internal events</strong> are triggers that are based on specific conditions or decisions. Examples are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Inventory level drops below the reorder level,
            </li>
            <li>
                Management decide to withdraw product<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Temporal events</strong> are events that occur as a result of the passage of time. Examples of these are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Payment becomes overdue,&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                End of Month
            </li>
            <li>
                End of Year.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Using a variety of different sources that are available, identify candidate events. This simply involves considering
    what things happen, that the business has to respond to. Potential sources of candidate events are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Engagement team's knowledge of the business<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing documentation<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Business Scenarios<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Capability Model and associated descriptions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Business Activity Model<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Business Information Model&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        High-Level descriptions of current systems&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        High-level procedure manuals<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizational structure charts with responsibilities<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Interviews / workshops with business staff
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Through an understanding of the business of the enterprise, one can "brainstorm" a list of the major events.
</p>
<p>
    For external events, consider all the external individuals and organizations that the enterprise has some contact with.
    The most obvious of these are their customers. Identify all the major things that could happen that would cause these
    individuals and organizations to contact the enterprise. Consider the things that most affect the profitability and
    success of the enterprise
</p>
<p>
    For internal events, consider what changes in the enterprise business information / data would require the business to
    react, (e.g. fall of stock levels below reorder level). Also consider any unpredictable management decisions that would
    have a significant effect on the business and/or initiate a lot of business activity.
</p>
<p>
    For temporal events, consider normal temporal boundaries, (e.g. end of day, week, quarter, calendar year, financial
    year), and what processing they require. Also identify those things that require a response if they do not happen in a
    predefined time interval, (e.g. customer does not pay within payment period).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    It is important to distinguish between events that are external to the enterprise those that are internal to the
    enterprise but outside the scope of the engagement. For example, In an engagement covering only the Sales and Marketing
    functions of an enterprise, if a product is suspended or withdrawn as a result of manufacturing difficulties, then that
    event should be treated as an external event, even though the manufacturing function is part of the same enterprise.
</p>
<p>
    If Business Context Diagrams / Models are available, these are a good source of the major events. The interactions
    shown on a diagram/model will provide a basic set of communication channels where business events may occur.
</p>
<p>
    If a "Classified Business Terms" WP has been developed, it is worth examining the content for any terms that the
    business actually uses to describe specific events. It is rare that a business has an exhaustive list of such terms,
    because business thinking is usually focused on what happens inside the business.&nbsp; Process-oriented terms from the
    classified business terms, also give some indication of events that occur in the business.
</p>
<p>
    Consider all the events from a logical perspective and identify where several different events appear as one, purely
    because of the physical implementation, (e.g. a credit card payment counterfoil usually has a "change of address"
    section on its reverse side. There is not one "Payment Counterfoil Received" event but a "Customer changes Address"
    event and a "Customer makes Payment" event).<br />
    This logical perspective may mean that some apparent temporal events are not events at all and are simply due to how
    the enterprise has implemented its response. (e.g. if confirmation of customer enquiries are sent out in a batch at the
    end of the month, then this is not a true temporal event but simply a result of the chosen physical implementation of
    the event 'Customer makes enquiry').<br />
    If a Business Activity Model or Business Process Model is available, consider each activity/process and what event, (or
    events) initiated the activity. Remember that lower level activities may not have a direct connection with the
    initiating event, so you will have to trace back through the activity sequence.
</p>
<p>
    If a Business Information Model is available, identify what major events create or change the state of the information
    classes. What happens that results in the creation of the information? What modifies the information? What moves the
    information to a "dead" or "deleted" or "archived" status?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Validation & Verification</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once a set of events has been identified, review these with the business. Use the following <strong>quality
    criteria</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Each event is associated with at least one business activity (if an activity model has been developed).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Each business activity is associated with at least one business event<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The key properties for every event have been documented<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When a Business Context Diagram has been developed, every interface point on the diagram should be represented by
        at least one event on the list.
    </li>
    <li>
        Events should be defined at a consistent level of granularity.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The events are logical<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The events are significant<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        There is no duplication of events.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Advice & Guidance</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When identifying the events, there is often confusion regarding the main concepts involved. A definition of these is as
    follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Source -</strong> the external entity (person, organization) that sends the stimulus to the enterprise,
        (e.g. customer)&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stimulus -</strong> the information / data that the enterprise receives that informs it of the event, (new
        address)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event</strong> - the happening that causes the source to send the stimulus to the enterprise, (e.g.
        Customer changes their address)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physical Trigger</strong> - the physical form that the stimulus takes, (e.g. phone call, written letter,
        e-mail message, credit card payment counterfoil)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Large organizations will have hundreds, (or thousands!) of elementary events. It is important that this task focuses
    only on those that are most significant to the business. This significance will stem from the volume of the given event
    or its importance to the enterprises profitability and success.
</p>
<p>
    Involve customers, industry experts, and end users in the formulation and review of the business events.
</p>
<p>
    A potentially useful means of identifying events is to walk though a typical 'day in the life' of a business
    user.<br />
    If the team find the list is growing too large, it is useful to group events into categories.
</p>
<p>
    Watch for redundancy.&nbsp; Some events may be subsumed by others.&nbsp; In such cases, you may choose to represent
    subsumed events as part of an aggregation of a larger event grouping.
</p>
<p>
    A consistent level of granularity may be difficult to achieve.&nbsp; This isn't a serious problem.
</p>
<p>
    It is often useful to clarify which events are in or out of scope.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Define and Document Business Events</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once a list of events has been identified, develop a definition of each one, including how it relates to the business
    activities.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Document Key Properties:</strong> For each event identified document the key properties. These are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Event Number</strong> - Sequentially allocated number to aid the future referencing of the event<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event Name</strong> - Name the event. For external events, use the name of the external entity and indicate
        what they do that requires the enterprise to respond. For internal events, indicate what triggering condition has
        occurred. For temporal events, simply state what has happened, (in many cases, using the word "due" is
        appropriate).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event Description</strong> - A full definition of the event, including who or what the source is, an
        explanation of what they have done that requires a response and an indication of what information they send as a
        stimulus. For temporal events, define what conditions apply, (e.g. the 5th April every Year, the 2nd Friday of
        every month, when 21 days have elapsed after confirmation of delivery). Describe the current physical triggers and
        any potential future ones<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Event Frequency/Volume</strong> - Provide some indication on how often the event takes place.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Relate Events to Business Activities:</strong> Develop a matrix showing what events trigger each of the
    business activities.
</p>

<p>
    There are no specific tools associated with this technique. The use of spreadsheets with associated text documents is
    the most common form of documentation.
