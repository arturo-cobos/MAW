    <strong>Description</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This guideline provides overview information regarding Change Agent Deployment during Packaged Solution Implementation
    projects. The normal reaction to change during package implementations is resistance. If not identified and resolved,
    this resistance can be disastrous to ERP, SCM and CRM implementations.&nbsp; The most efficient way to reduce
    resistance is to involve and inform people as much as possible.&nbsp; (This is one way of increasing broad-based
    participation, one of IBM's eight critical success factors for managing change.)&nbsp; The issues and interests of the
    affected people or groups (stakeholders) must be considered and activities planned to support them through the
    change.&nbsp; Key change agents must be identified who can act as role models for change and execute transition
    management and organization transition activities both during and after the implementation.&nbsp; IBMâ€™s Change Agent
    Deployment Program provides a series of integrated activities for preparing and involving change agents to address
    stakeholder issues and concerns.&nbsp; It is designed to increase the likelihood of success for a project by involving
    key people or groups in the change and planning specific activities to support them through the change.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Context</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The IBM approach to Change Agent Deployment consists of a series of workshops and other activities used to identify
    stakeholders for the implementation effort, identify change agents who can effectively lead change for the identified
    target communities, assess the needs of each of the target communities, identify activities required for change agents
    to meet these needs, and provide management, monitoring, and measurement of effectiveness of the change deployment
    activities.<br />
    Understanding how the project will roll out and how each stakeholder will be affected at each stage allows activities
    to be planned and targeted toward the issues and needs of the individual groups.&nbsp; Stakeholders can be both
    internal and external, and will have varying degrees of involvement in the implementation and multiple responses to the
    changes imposed on them.&nbsp; Deploying change agents who are closely aligned with the stakeholder groups can enable
    rapid acceptance of change. These change agents can deploy transition management activities that will be accepted
    quickly because the change agent has both the right level of influence and the respect of the stakeholder group he is
    supporting.&nbsp; They can also gather feedback information to allow the project team and Organization Change
    Management (OCM) team to proactively make adjustments to both the implementation plan and the transition management
    plan.
</p>
<p>
    The changes created as a result of ERP, SCM and CRM implementations are successful only if they are effectively driven
    from within the organization.&nbsp; Broad-based participation and involvement from relevant staff at all levels of the
    organization is required for a smooth transition.&nbsp; If the issues and concerns of both internal and external
    stakeholder groups are not considered and supported, acceptance of the change will be limited, or delayed.&nbsp; This
    can cause delays in the implementation, or a disruption of performance after go-live so sever that benefits expected
    from the implementation are not realized in time to balance the time and effort invested in the project.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Analyze / define user issues and needs</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Change Agent Deployment Program is developed, reviewed, and adopted to clearly define objectives, roles, scope, and
    principles of engagement and participation. Key stakeholder groups impacted by the implementation are identified and
    segmented during the Change Agent Deployment Workshop.&nbsp; Stakeholder groups are analyzed based on their reactions
    to change and their level of involvement.
</p>
<p>
    The Change Agent Deployment Program Workshop is used to define and analyze user needs. This workshop is conducted as
    early as possible in the implementation effort. Typically the role-mapping method is the vehicle used to facilitate
    this process. Initially conducted as a series of meetings with the organization change team, a draft role map is
    developed which identifies the implementation targets, change agents, and change sponsors.
</p>
<p>
    The draft role map is presented to the steering committee, project management, and project team leads for confirmation.
    After implementation targets and change agents are identified and agreed, specific change needs for each target
    community are identified.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Identify and assess change agents</strong>
</p>
<p>
    High-level stakeholder objectives and needs are documented and potential change agents selected who have the span of
    influence and direct involvement needed to support the stakeholder groups. Expected roles and responsibilities are
    presented and accepted.&nbsp; Critical capabilities of change agents are assessed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Change agent structure
    and governance is adopted.&nbsp; Feedback mechanisms are defined and accepted.
</p>
<p>
    Following confirmation of the draft role map, it is necessary to review the change agents identified for each of the
    target communities. The role mapping process identifies those individuals as change agents who provide guidance or
    influence to a target community. During the analysis process, it is necessary to determine if the change agents
    identified are likely to be supportive of the change required to successfully implement the package solution. In many
    cases, some initial change agents are not likely to provide needed support. In these cases alternate change agents must
    be identified.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Match deployment activities with user needs</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Deployment activities to meet stakeholder needs and objectives are defined based on information gathered from the
    project team, visioning sessions, readiness and sponsorship interviews and the Change Agent Deployment Workshop.&nbsp;
    Budget and resource requirements and geographic coverage requirements are documented.&nbsp; The change agent structure,
    roles and responsibilities and recommended deployment activities are documented in the Change Agent Deployment
    Strategy.
</p>
<p>
    Once change agents have been identified and confirmed, the Deployment Strategy Workshop is conducted with project
    management, project team leads, and representatives from the business for implementation target communities. This
    workshop is used to define the strategy which will be used to effectively lead change at the grassroots level for the
    package implementation effort.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Plan activities and prepare change agents</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The OCM team leads work with the implementation project manager and appropriate sponsors to align the change agent
    deployment activities and budget and resource requirements with the master timeline and implementation plan. Ownership
    for change agent deployment activities are assigned and scheduled as a part of the Change Agent Deployment Plan.
</p>
<p>
    Once the deployment strategy has been developed, the deployment plan is developed to guide change agent activities.
    These activities are as detailed as required to provide guidance to change agents. However, it is typically better to
    provide change agents with activities at a level of detail which will enable them to understand specifically what is
    required and how they will be able to achieve it.
</p>
<p>
    Concurrent with the development of the deployment plan, it is beneficial to develop the presentation that will be used
    to prepare change agents. This presentation, tailored to specific client needs, should explain to change agents why
    they were chosen and what is expected of them. It is important than change agents understand that they will be critical
    in the success of the implementation effort. As change agents, they will be required to lead the change in their
    respective communities, demonstrating their commitment to and support of the implementation effort.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Integrate / execute the change agent deployment plan</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Change Agent Deployment Plan Execution is the ongoing process of monitoring, measuring and optimizing the Change Agent
    Deployment Plan as needed.
</p>
<p>
    Activities identified as elements of the change agent deployment plan are incorporated into the overall transition
    management plan. Execution of change agent deployment plan activities are reported and tracked against this transition
    management plan.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Monitor and measure effectiveness</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Targeted feedback assessments are conducted and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the change agents and the
    deployment activities.&nbsp; Adjustments are made to the plan based on the feedback results.
</p>
<p>
    The most effective way to monitor and measure is through the organization change readiness assessment. To best use this
    tool, an early change readiness assessment must be conducted to establish baseline data. Subsequent change readiness
    assessment conducted with the target community will reveal the effectiveness of the change agent deployment program.
    Data gathered during these subsequent change readiness assessments is used adjust the change agent deployment
    program.<br />
