    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    This summarization focuses on the assessment of a set of measures against specific performance expectations and
    provides a methodology for deriving an overall assessment score for that measurement set.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    The “scorecard” as a reporting mechanism is widely used within the business and IT community given its earliest
    introductions through the work of Robert Kaplan and David Norton in their Harvard Business Review article entitled,
    “The Balanced Scorecard – Measures that Drive Performance”.
</p>
<p>
    This technique paper does not intend to replace or duplicate an organizations desire to apply the methodologies devised
    by Kaplan and Norton as a way to identify and define a set of measures appropriate for a scorecard.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Instead, it seeks to compliment the approaches and techniques described by a measurement model, with a corollary
    approach for deriving an appropriate scorecard from a measurement model.
</p>
<p>
    As part of laying the groundwork for further discussion in the development of the scorecard, it is important that a
    thorough understanding of the stakeholders associated with the measurement program be performed.&nbsp; In the IBM
    Global Services environment, those stakeholder could include both IBM internal organizations such as a Competency /
    Competency Segment and IBM’s Customers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    To further this discussion, it is not uncommon for IBM’s Services Customers to require the implementation of a
    scorecard to give them appropriate visibility into the achievements that IBM is delivering to them.
</p>
<p>
    The picture below describes some of the stakeholders that may need to be considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <img height="323" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/BuildingaScorecardfig1.JPG" width="438" />
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    Before defining an approach for building a scorecard in section 3, it is important to first define the scorecard in a
    generic sense as a framework for applying the steps for development and to define the necessary terms used to support
    the scorecards development.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What is a scorecard?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In a very generic sense, a scorecard could be analogously looked at in the context of a student’s grade point average
    (GPA) – the net result of a series of assessments across different courses, ultimately resulting in a singular
    assessment of a student’s achievement.<br />
    The scorecard takes this analogy one step further by organizing the various courses into appropriate categories and
    applying a weight to each of the defined categories.
</p>
<p>
    Following through with the GPA example, consider the idea of weighting the effect of various courses on the GPA based
    on the area of study and relationship to your chosen field (or major of study).&nbsp; For instance, if you are computer
    science major, your classes in computer related courses were given a higher weighting than non-major courses that every
    student was required to take.
</p>
<p>
    To re-phrase the analogy into terms associated with the measurement model, each measurement is placed into an
    appropriate measurement category.&nbsp; A target is established for each measure to be used to evaluate
    performance.&nbsp; Each of the measurement categories has an assigned weighting factor determined by the overall
    importance of the category.&nbsp; The scorecard is then simply a computation, first at the category level to determine
    the categories score and than across each category to arrive at an overall score for the scorecard.
</p>
<p>
    The following picture describes this concept:
</p>
<p>
    <img height="454" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/BuildingaScorecardfig2.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    It is important to note that in step 1, the sum of the weighting for each category must be equal to 100%.&nbsp; You can
    see that in category D, where there are two measurements, that the total is indeed 100%.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    In addition, in step 2, the sum of all of the weights for the categories must also sum 100%.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, at both the category level in step 1 and the final score from step 2; the numeric assessment result could be
    translated into an alphabetic grade given an appropriate scale definition.
</p>
<p>
    For instance, an A could be defined as 90 to 100, a B as 80 to 90 and so on.&nbsp; The grade letter result for category
    A for by a “B” and for category C would receive an “A”.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the scorecard can be built at multiple levels of the organization.&nbsp; In addition, the assessment of a
    single scorecard can be done at different levels of the organization.&nbsp; For instance, a single scorecard could be
    assessed at the CIO level of the organization and then individually assessed at the business units and various
    application areas.
</p>
<p>
    In this level of context, several critical success factors should be understood before moving into the steps for
    building a scorecard:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A reasonable number of measures should be included in the scorecard.&nbsp; If the measurement model has dozens of
        measures, they should not all be included in the scorecard.
    </li>
    <li>
        The number of categories should be kept small.&nbsp; You could use the same categories described in the measurement
        model, or map the measurements to a smaller set of categories, such as the classic four from Kaplan and
        Norton.&nbsp; They are described below:
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img height="397" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/BuildingaScorecardfig3.JPG" width="525" />&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The appropriate processes must be implemented and in place to handle a number of operational requirements of a
        scorecard: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Define / refine the measurements included in the scorecard (might be done yearly for example)
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify the targets for the measurements (done in conjunction with the refinements to the scorecard
                measures)
            </li>
            <li>
                Define the weighting for each of the scorecard categories
            </li>
            <li>
                Define the weighting for each of the measures included in each of the categories of the
                scorecard&nbsp;<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    3.1&nbsp; Define the categories for the scorecard
</h4>
<p>
    In deciding what categorization schema to use for the scorecard, it is suggested that this categorization schema be the
    same, or map closely to the categories used in building the measurement model.&nbsp; This is important given that the
    balancing and prioritization processes performed in building the measurement model can be carried over into the
    processes for developing the scorecard.
</p>
<h4>
    3.2&nbsp; Identify the measures to include in each category
</h4>
<p>
    Once the categories are defined, the measures to be included in each category should be identified.&nbsp; There are
    several ways to accomplish this:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        A facilitated session that includes the various stakeholders of the scorecard to identify the measures 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The relative importance of the goals and behaviors that these measures drive.&nbsp; If there are specific
                goals that are vitally important to both the account and the customer’s success, those should be included
                in the measurement model
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Include the highest priority measures from the measurement model – for instance the top 2 or 3.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    It is not uncommon at this point to also include contractually obligated measures since the scorecard can provide an
    additional level of visibility for those measures.
</p>
<h4>
    3.3&nbsp; Define the weighting for each measure
</h4>
<p>
    Now that the measures are defined, the weight of each measure can be considered.&nbsp; Again, there are several ways to
    accomplish this:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        A facilitated session such as the one used in Step 2 could also be used to weight the measures.
    </li>
    <li>
        An equal split could be done for each of the measures (for instance 2 measures could be split 50-50, 4 –
        25-25-25-25).
    </li>
    <li>
        A more specific weight could be determined by the importance of each measure as determined by the measurement
        model.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    3.4&nbsp; Define the weighting for each category
</h4>
<p>
    The final step in building the scorecard is to determine the weight for each category. This can be done by identifying
    the relative weighting of the various measurement categories by looking at the prioritization that was performed in the
    measurement model.&nbsp; Since the prioritization is typically done at the measurement category level in addition to
    the measurement level, the category with the highest overall prioritization could get the highest weighting, second
    highest, etc.
</p>
<p>
    A second way could be done based on the relative important of each category as defined by the scorecard
    stakeholders.&nbsp; This can be done in a facilitated session during the identification of the measurements to be
    included in the model and the weighting of each of the measures.
</p>
<h4>
    3.5&nbsp; Establish a baseline and/or targets for each measure
</h4>
<p>
    In order for the scorecard to provide feedback on the performance of the organization, several attributes must be
    considered for each measure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A baseline helps to establish the “where am I today?” context and can be used to help establish the targets for
        each measure 
        <ul>
            <li>
                For example, a target might be a 5% year over year improvement in productivity.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Targets need to be established for each measure in order to determine the performance attainment for each
        measure.&nbsp; These help to establish the “where do I want to be?” context for each measure. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                For example, a target might be a turnover rate of no greater than 8% by 2002.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    3.6&nbsp; Define the scoring criteria for each measure and category
</h4>
<p>
    If the requirement(s) to assign an equivalent grading is needed for the scorecard at the measurement level, the
    category level or both, the scoring criteria need to be established.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        These could follow traditional educational scoring: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;90% and greater Attainment = A
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;80% to 90% = B
            </li>
            <li>
                70% to 80% = C
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;etc.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Or the scoring could be defined in relationship to the targets established: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                + / - 5% of the target = A
            </li>
            <li>
                + / - 5 to 10% = B
            </li>
            <li>
                etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Scorecard Hint’s and Tip’s</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Although already stressed in the context section, it is important to remember to try to keep the number of measures
        included in the scorecard to a small set.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        In addition to the approach described in the technique paper, a variation of the methodology described in the
        various publications that describe developing Balanced Scorecard could also be applied on the defined measurement
        model to help identify and weight the set of measures for the scorecard.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Tools
</h3>
<p>
    There are a number of effective tools that can be used to produce a scorecard report.&nbsp; These include the
    following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Spreadsheets: Static reports that are updated on a monthly basis to show overall performance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Real-Time Graphs: A number of tools, such as Wired for OLAP and BRIO, allow the end-user to view performance
        results in a graphical manner.&nbsp; These tools support analysis through drill-downs and other analytical
        techniques.&nbsp; These techniques enable root-cause analysis to be done on those organizations (or on the
        organization as a whole) that are performing at a less-than-desirable level.
    </li>
    <li>
        In addition, there are many good Scorecard tools that are available that deal specifically with reporting and
        analysis around a scorecard and can compliment any number of database architectures to source the data:

<p>
    Real-time graphical reports are the recommended alternative because of their dynamic access and for the speed with
    which they provide unambiguous feedback concerning the performance of an organization.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    5&nbsp;Examples
</h3>
<p>
    The following is a sample of a scorecard built in a spreadsheet tool.&nbsp; This example uses the measurement model
    categorization schema (6 measurement categories) for assessing the results of the scorecard.
