    1&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    The paper provides examples of the probing questions to ask customers to define their current organizations
    capabilities and requirements. The answers can then be provided to an IRM specialist who can help the team to determine
    which solution areas are of the next highest priority.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    Prior to completing the Rollout Checklist, a practitioner should become familiar with the information in this paper,
    perform some initial probing or observing of the customer environment, and engage an IRM specialist.&nbsp; The
    following activities should occur:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The practitioner should observe and explore the customer environment to determine the scope and if there are
        additional opportunities.&nbsp; Depending upon the relationship the practitioner has with the customer, this could
        include visiting customer sites and operations and interviewing staff, or it could simply be a discussion with the
        Account Representative.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The practitioner should schedule interview(s) with the customer. The interviews can include the CEO, CIO, CFO,
        Marketing management or other staff as appropriate to determine business direction and initiatives.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The practitioner should ask probing questions and maintain a written record of the answers provided by the
        customer(s).&nbsp; Sometimes, it will be more appropriate to provide the customer with a questionnaire for
        completion prior to the interviews.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The sample questions under “Examples” can be used as a starting point. The practitioner can add more questions as
        required to determine customer requirements, the scope, and additional service opportunities.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The practitioner can involve the regional Infrastructure Resource Management specialist during the discussion with
        the customer, or can request assistance from the IRM specialist to assess the results obtained from the
        customer.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The information obtained from the customer should be assessed and categorized into services requested by the
        customer, services needed to complete the solution, and future services required by the customer.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the results with the Account Rep, Principal or Consultant assigned to the customer, make revisions, if
        necessary.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate the findings with the customer.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the information to refine the scope, prioritize the services identified, and identify the next areas of
        services that will be needed by the customer.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Tools
</h3>
<p>
    Each region has specialists available to validation the conclusions derived from the questioning below.&nbsp; In
    addition, the ITS National Practice can provide assistance in certain situations.&nbsp; It is highly recommended that
    the regional personnel become involved in the determination of starburst opportunity identification and implementation.

<h3>
    4&nbsp;Examples
</h3>
<p>
    The following questions were developed to aid in determining rollout project scope as well as additional follow-on
    and/or starburst opportunities associated with Infrastructure Resources Management.&nbsp; They follow the ITS Blueprint
    and are organized according to IRM offering elements, ITM offering capabilities, and additional ITS offerings that are
    typically integrated with IRM.
