<p>
    <strong>1.1&nbsp; Starting Point – Base Requirements</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are no easy answers to capacity planning questions.&nbsp; The list below serves as a starting point for sizing
    issues.&nbsp; These are the hardware requirements for installing WebSphere Application Server on any supported
    platform. Other supported software (for example, your database program) may have additional requirements.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        75 MB disk space to install from compact disc
    </li>
    <li>
        300 MB disk space to install from Web download (100 MB installation image, 100 MB to unzip files, 75 - 100 MB to
        install)&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        300 MB disk space for product (footprint)&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        256 MB of RAM to run IBM WebSphere Application Server (512 MB is recommended)&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Network interface
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The requirements given above are basically what come printed on the WebSphere box.&nbsp; In practice, these
    requirements have been proven inadequate.&nbsp; For decent performance, there is a recommended base requirement to host
    WAS of 1024MB, not 512MB and especially not 256MB.&nbsp; In addition, WAS uses DB2, which has a base requirement of 512
    MB.&nbsp; This is a total base requirement of 1536 MB of memory.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.2&nbsp; Best Approach to Sizing WAS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The significant factor in determining system requirements for WebSphere Application Server is processor performance and
    RAM. WAS specifies a minimum of 512 MB RAM, however, 1024MB or 1536MB if using DB2, have been determined to be more
    appropriate for good performance.&nbsp; Disk capacity requirements depend on the Web content developed for the
    solution, the WebSphere Application Server itself requires around 40 MB of space.
</p>
<p>
    WebSphere is but one component of many in a production environment. The client, the communications network, the web
    server, the application server, the database server, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) all play a role in
    performance.&nbsp; When determining your hardware needs there are several things to consider in addition to the
    requirements listed above.&nbsp; The most important of these issues are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How busy will it be?&nbsp; Such as, how many hits per hour the server will handle?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        What other workloads in addition to WAS will be running on this box and what are those workloads
        requirements?&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        How large is the application (number of static web pages, JSPs, servlets, EJBs and so forth)?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As&nbsp;a practitioner you will need to know how the infrastructure will be set up.&nbsp; In order to size a box you
    must know what workloads it will be expected to handle.&nbsp; How many application servers will run on this box?&nbsp;
    Will the web server run on the same box as the App Server?&nbsp; Where will the database server run?&nbsp; What are the
    disk requirements of the application itself?&nbsp; One cannot begin to properly size WAS until all the questions are
    answered.
</p>
<p>
    Now comes the tricky part: performance.&nbsp; How will this machine be expected to run?&nbsp; How many hits will it
    receive and how will it grow in the future?&nbsp; Simply put, the faster the processor and the larger the memory the
    better the performance.&nbsp; If the minimum requirements are all that are met, this practitioner has left no room for
    vertical scaling (the addition of clones).&nbsp; Adding clones will increase performance only if the machine is not
    running at 100% capacity.&nbsp; If this box is sized to have the resources necessary to support additional application
    servers (clones), performance can be increased both vertically and horizontally.
</p>
<p>
    In summary when sizing for WebSphere, the practitioner should consider the following:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The infrastructure – how the workloads will be distributed.&nbsp; The practitioner must know which workloads will
        run on each machine he wants to size.&nbsp; More importantly, he or she must know how many machines will share the
        workoad.
    </li>
    <li>
        The requirements of each supported workload.
    </li>
    <li>
        The size of the application being served.&nbsp; He must know how much RAM and disk space the web content will
        require.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        If sessions are to be used, he must know how much memory and disk space each session will require.
    </li>
    <li>
        The practitioner must know how busy the servers will be and how many hits are expected.&nbsp; The busier the server
        the more memory required and the faster the processors must be.
    </li>
    <li>
        He or she must know what the plans for growth are and how they are planning to scale.&nbsp; If they plan to scale
        vertically (cloning), the machine must have the resources necessary to support this.&nbsp; If they plan to scale
        horizontally (additional servers) the RAM and memory requirements may not be as great. More information on this can
        be found at <a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/doc/v30/se/web/help/model.htm">http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/doc/v30/se/web/help/model.htm</a>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>1.3&nbsp; Example WebSphere Solution Sizing Requirements</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Below is a table of the suggested configuration requirmements for a successful WebSphere v3.5 solution on a variety of
    platforms. These configurations will provide adequate performance for a midrange workload. Note that WebSphere best
    scales linearly, and to improve performance of a system, it is suggested to simply add more machines rather than
    increase the number of processors or size of RAM.&nbsp; There have been tests where there are diminishing returns once
    the processors increase above four.&nbsp; It is not reccomended that you use these suggestions as a substitute for the
    tools listed within this paper.
</p>

    <img height="407" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/websphere_app_server_sizing_table1.JPG" width="600" />
</p>
<p>
    The configurations given above are a good starting point for medium sized development efforts. Optimal configuration
    information will be largely influenced by the many components of the individual environment, and will only be
    determined after several development efforts are underway.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.4&nbsp; Sizing Tools</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Some hardware platforms offer sizing tools to make the sizing process easier.&nbsp; These platforms and there tools are
    discussed in detail below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NT, AIX, and Solaris Platforms</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps the most useful tool, this site provides an estimate as to what type of processor, number of CPUs, and/or
    number of machines necessary to achieve a throughput of your selection.&nbsp; You will enter the workload and the
    expected TPS (transactions per second), and the tool will return to you suggestions and response times.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>AS/400 (OS/400)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sizing AS/400 has been made simple thanks to the convenient IBM Workload Estimator.&nbsp; The IBM Workload Estimator is
    an easy to use sizing tool that can be run on-line or be downloaded to your PC for mobile use. It is an invaluable tool
    that takes into account how many hits per hour are expected, number of static HTML pages being served, JSPs, servlets,
    EJBs and so forth.&nbsp; It takes everything into account needed to decide on the appropriate hardware.&nbsp; The
    estimator has been enhanced to include the ability for multiple existing systems to be present in an estimation. This
    will aid you in considering consolidating multiple AS/400 systems into one new iSeries 400.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the new
    tutorials, "Consolidating Existing Systems", deals with this feature.&nbsp; The tool is currently capable of sizing
    Domino, Java, WebSphere, WebSphere CommerceSuite, and traditional workloads, either separately or in combination.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The IBM Workload Estimator can be located at: <a href="http://as400service.ibm.com/servlet/EstimatorServlet">http://as400service.ibm.com/servlet/EstimatorServlet</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>RS/6000 (UNIX and Linux)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    IBM provides a sizing tool for the WebSphere Application Server on RS/6000 to estimate required hardware configuration.
    This sizing tool for RS/6000 Servers running WebSphere Application Server has been developed to answer the need for
    readily accessible sizing assistance for IBM's WebSphere Application Server product.&nbsp; It provides a Web-based
    sizing tool that helps the specialist to answer a few basic questions, and then provides detailed recommendations as to
    the RS/6000 servers that meet the needs of the solution. The sizer for the IBM WebSphere Application Server has been
    developed based upon performance information derived from a standard benchmark designed by IBM lab. This tool makes it
    easy to determine proper RS/6000 server models for given workloads.
</p>
<p>
    The sizing tool can be accessed at the following URL: <a href="http://w3-1.ibm.com/sales/systems/ibmsm.nsf/mainframeset?readform&geo=EMEA&cdoc=rs6ksizer">http://w3-1.ibm.com/sales/systems/ibmsm.nsf/mainframeset?readform&geo=EMEA&cdoc=rs6ksizer</a>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>All Platforms</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The WAS 3.5 Sizing Worksheet provides a generic approach to sizing WAS for any platform, however, whenever possible use
    the platform specific tools listed above.&nbsp; This worksheet is also helpful to use in conjunction with the platform
    specific tools listed in this paper.&nbsp; If used properly this worksheet provides a rough estimate of suggested RAM,
    disk space, and processing power necessary to support WAS and a given application.&nbsp; The WebSphere Sizing Worksheet
    is attached at the end of this document.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.5&nbsp; Appendix A – WAS 3.5 Sizing Worksheet</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This worksheet is intended to aid the practitioner in sizing a machine for WAS 3.5 and the application it is to
    support.&nbsp; This worksheet provides only a rough estimate, and a margin of error is to be expected.&nbsp; One should
    also consult the sizing tools available online.&nbsp; These URLs can befound on the WAS Sizing technique paper.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Assumptions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Assumes an n-tier environment.&nbsp; This tool works best for sizing a box in a typical 3-tier environment.&nbsp;
        In other words, the web server and the database servers will reside on different machines.&nbsp; If you are using
        this tool to size a box supporting either the web server or the DB server in addition to WAS, be sure to include
        its requirements in steps 12 and 13.&nbsp; Remember results will be most accurate for the n-tier environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are clustering boxes to share the workload, you may use this tool in different ways.&nbsp; You may enter
        full values for all of the questions, and when the requirements are given at the end of the worksheet spread the
        requirements accross all the boxes you plan to use.&nbsp; Alternatively, you may enter only the values for the
        workload each box will be expected to support.&nbsp; If you are sizing only one box, no adjustments are necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        This worksheet assumes default WebSphere settings.&nbsp; If you adjust these setting you must compensate for the
        adjustments in the worksheet.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Part One:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
    Answer the following questions about the box you are sizing and record your answers to the right.&nbsp; Each input is
    explained below.&nbsp; <strong>It is recommended to read the explanation on the next page for each question before
    answering it.</strong>

    <strong>Explanation of Inputs</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The number of users being serviced at any point in time.&nbsp; In other words, the total number of user requests
        active in the WebSphere server.&nbsp; Remember, if using NT or W2K with OSE connect (web server on different box)
        you must create a clone for every 25 concurrent users or spray to a different box.&nbsp; You will be asked how many
        clones in number 15.&nbsp; See the WebSphere Info Center for more details on cloning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Answer yes or no.
    </li>
    <li>
        The size (bytes) of multiplying number of records and number of bytes in a record in inquiring
        database.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not know the exact number use the following to estimate:&nbsp; Small=100,
        Medium=1000, Large=10000 bytes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Every JDBC connection will require RAM.&nbsp; Include the maximum number of anticipated JDBC connections to all
        planned databases including the session database, the application database, and the LDAP database.
    </li>
    <li>
        To determine this you must consult the application developer.&nbsp; Obtain a maximum estimate from the
        developer.&nbsp; The number and complexity of EJBs, JSPs, servlets, and static web pages will affect the
        requirements.&nbsp; If EJBs are not being used, step five is less of a concern.
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the maximum disk size required by the application.&nbsp; Be sure to include all web pages, EJBs, JSPs, and
        Servlets.
    </li>
    <li>
        RAM requirements depend on how large your Web applications are and whether you are running your administration
        console from the same server or from another server in your network. By running your administration database from
        another server in your network, you can free up memory resources and thereby reduce RAM requirements.

    </li>

        Different platforms have different requirements.&nbsp; You must determine the requirements of your selected
        platform.

        Different platforms have different requirements.&nbsp; You must determine the requirements of your selected
        platform.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have other workloads (i.e.: a database server, application server) supported by this machine, you must add
        those requirements to those of WAS and the application.&nbsp; For example, HTTP server has a base requirement of
        180MB of RAM.&nbsp; See the WebServer Sizing TP.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compute RAM requirements of all other workloads.&nbsp; Use MB.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compute disk requirements of all other workloads.&nbsp; Use MB.
    </li>
    <li>
        This is a 'fudge factor', or error allowance. The sizing suggestions will be at least this much higher than your
        target throughput. That is, if your target throughput is 50 TPS, and you specify a risk ratio of 20%, the system
        will be sized to handle 60 TPS. Use this to compensate for uncertainty in the size of your transactions.&nbsp; If
        the machine will be handling heavy/complicated transactional workloads it is advised to increase this percent.
    </li>
    <li>
        Vertical scaling (the addition of clones) is an excellent method to increase performance so long as your CPU is
        running at less than 100%.&nbsp; Each clone will require RAM, enter the number of clones you plan on
        creating.&nbsp; Do not include the model as a clone.&nbsp; IMPORTANT: If you are running NT or W2K, you
        <strong>must</strong> create a clone for every 25 concurrent users.&nbsp; For example: if you answered 100 to
        number one, you must create at least four clones (100 / 4).

    <strong>Note:</strong> If this machine is supporting a writable database server, this estimate will be inaccurate.

<p>
    <strong>Part Four: Processing Power and Clustering</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Determining processing power is the most difficult part of sizing for WAS.&nbsp; To make things easier, IBM offers a
    site that provides an estimate as to what type of processor, number of CPUs, and/or number of machines necessary to
    achieve a throughput of your selection.&nbsp; You will enter the workload and the expected TPS (transactions per
    second), and the tool will return to you a list of suggestions and response times.&nbsp; The tool works for NT, AIX,
    and Solaris platforms.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Sizing a server to support a given workload is not a simple task. A complete sizing exercise can take weeks of effort
    and involve a bewilding number of variables.&nbsp; If you are unable to conduct your own testing specific to your
    environment, it is recommended that you review other benchmarks that may be similar to your situation.&nbsp; The
    Standard PerformanceEvaluation Corporation maintains a standardized set of relative benchmarks and metrics.&nbsp; Use
    these to evaluate your situation and aid you in deciding on appropriate processing power and clustering options.

<p>
    <strong>Closing Considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The intention of this worksheet was to provide only estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is more likely to overestimate
    rather than underestimate, there are no guarantees.&nbsp; There are many possible factors specific to each situation
    that could upset these recommendations.&nbsp; Optimal configuration information will be largely influenced by the many
    components of the individual environment, and will only be optimally determined after several development efforts are
    underway.
