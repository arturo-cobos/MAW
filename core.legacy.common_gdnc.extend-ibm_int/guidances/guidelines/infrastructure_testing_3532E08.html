    1 Scope
</h3>
<p>
    To an applications developer, the concept of testing an infrastructure is not a normal process to be considered.&nbsp;
    And yet, as developers hasten to go to market quickly with newer technology and coding techniques, the environment on
    which these applications run are frequently suspect for delaying rollout or negatively affecting the final
    implementation.
</p>
<p>
    An infrastructure test is designed to verify that the way a system has been architect will support the applications
    that reside on it. It is a validation of the basic operating setup of hardware, software, network and interfaces and
    includes verification in regards to performance, capacity, load, security and business recovery functions as dictated
    by non-functional requirements of the application systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically an enterprise operates more than one
    environment, one for development, one for final Quality Assurance, another for production. The infrastructure test may
    be applied to all of the various environments, or to part of one environment such as a specific platform (e.g. Unix
    servers).&nbsp; Finally, an Infrastructure test may occur at varying times during the construction of these
    environments.
</p>
<h4>
    1.1&nbsp; A Short description of the Infrastructure Testing Engagement Model
</h4>
<p>
    The Infrastructure Testing Engagement Model describes testing technical or structural components: hardware, software,
    operating systems and network connectivity.&nbsp; It also includes testing the supporting operational
    processes.&nbsp;&nbsp; At a minimum, the following levels of testing or test focus areas are included in every
    Infrastructure testing engagement:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Basic system and system software verification<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        System Tests using scenario drivers<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Acceptance Test
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    1.2&nbsp; A Brief Review of Terminology
</h4>
<p>
    Some terms found that throughout this White Paper may be confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although these definitions are not
    official, for the purposes of this document, please consider the terms used as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Infrastructure:</strong>&nbsp; Infrastructure includes all aspects of the physical and operating environment
    within an enterprise, including network, system software, procedures.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Environment:</strong>&nbsp; An environment would be one instance of an infrastructure.&nbsp; For example, the
    target of testing may be only the QA environment set up for the purposes of testing applications in
    ‘close-to-production’ conditions.&nbsp; Other targets of testing may be the Production environment, a Sandbox
    environment (used to try out new concepts or software), or a Development environment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Platform:</strong>&nbsp; This is used, within this document, to refer to a specific portion of one environment
    such as a ‘server farm’ or components which have similar characteristics such as the NT platform or Unix platform
    (assuming that each component is similarly configured and operated).
</p>

<h3>
    3&nbsp;What is the Scope of Infrastructure Testing
</h3>
<p>
    The Scope of Infrastructure testing may extend from a structural test to include testing of critical application
    systems that operate within that infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    The structural components that may be targeted for testing include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Facilities:&nbsp; Physical building (Security, lighting, handicap access, physical design); powers systems – power
        distribution, UPS, grounding, remote emergency power off, standby generators; protection systems
        (annunciation/control, damage protection systems);&nbsp; Mechanical systems (HVAC, chilling systems)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Physical Network:&nbsp; Cabling, Connectivity, Organization<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Logical Network:&nbsp; Routing Services, LAN/WAN design<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Computing Resources:&nbsp; Distributed Servers, Rack mounts, Mainframes, Firewall/Proxy, File and Print services,
        e-mail services, Mail gateways, Web servers, Database servers, Application servers, Mirroring systems, Load
        dispatchers, redundant fail-over systems<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Interfaces:&nbsp; with vendors, suppliers, and business partners, excluding application-specific code.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Operational Processes:&nbsp; Change management, Problem Management, Performance Management, Software Distribution,
        Asset Management, Availability Management, Backup/Recovery Management, Disaster Recovery Process, Testing
        Procedures, Version Control, Help Desk
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As the testing of an Infrastructure expands, it may include all levels of testing normally applied to application
    development such as Systems Integration, and Operability testing.&nbsp; Acceptance testing is executed after
    Environment test (see below) or following Systems Integration testing, whichever is performed last.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    As the diagram below shows, the distinction between application and infrastructure testing becomes fuzzy.&nbsp; After
    the Environment test is conducted on an environment, application systems are used to continue the Infrastructure
    test.&nbsp; The ‘intent’ of the Infrastructure test, however, is different since the goal is to determine to what
    extent a target environment prevents or diminishes an application or application systems from operating according to
    their design goals.

<h3>
    4&nbsp;Why Conduct Infrastructure Tests?
</h3>
<p>
    The ideal goal of an infrastructure is to run as adaptive, scaleable, available and secure as possible while supporting
    the enterprise application systems.&nbsp; These goals cannot be achieved without adequate testing.&nbsp; As an
    infrastructure evolves, testing to ensure it supports critical applications is crucial.&nbsp; Tests may be conducted at
    any interval but should be especially considered under circumstances involving significant IT change such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        As a result of mergers or acquisitions, when two systems or enterprises are consolidated into one large
        environment.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Structural replacement and upgrading to support a new application system. Testing the application, itself, is
        treated under other engagement models.&nbsp; However, testing the non-functional requirements and ensuring they
        match the new application design are included within this model.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Sometimes large-scale changes to an environment make an Infrastructure test a wise choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        In other circumstances, an environment may not be performing suitably (e.g. Processing availability or stability)
        and it is wise to go back to basics to conduct a thorough Infrastructure test.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Tests may be conducted as part of ongoing Performance analysis of an environment in cooperation with Capacity Planning
    and Performance Management.
</p>
<p>
    Infrastructure testing, when performed as an integral part of critical application development, should verify the
    underlying structure to ensure the applications will perform as specified and according to expectations (service
    level).
</p>
<p>
    Infrastructure testing supplies the knowledge upon which critical business decisions may be made – to decentralize, to
    expand, to change development standards, to outsource, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Testing the infrastructure provides value by ensuring that the environment will support the business processes and
    thereby decrease downtime, maintain credibility, improve productivity, prevent unauthorized access to data.&nbsp; A
    company that is not ‘open for business’ will quickly lose clients and revenue.
</p>
<h3>
    5&nbsp;What Makes Infrastructure Testing Unique?
</h3>
<p>
    From an application developer’s perspective, the engagement model may be different from the full life-cycle-testing
    model in some respects.&nbsp; Here are a few key differences:
</p>
<h5>
    Environment is the test target
</h5>
<p>
    A major difference between Infrastructure testing and testing an application system is that the Infrastructure exists
    (that is, what you are testing).&nbsp; In application development testing, you may specify the infrastructure you want,
    build it, and then test the application.&nbsp; In Infrastructure testing, the environment is the target of your testing
    and up to a point, no changes to that environment are made to facilitate the tests.&nbsp; Nonetheless, once you go past
    Environment tests of an infrastructure, some adjustments to system software, such as turning on transaction tracking,
    may be needed to complete the Infrastructure test.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Multiple Environments Requiring Tests
</h5>
<p>
    A typical organization includes multiple test environments to support the full development of an application system.
    For example, the enterprise typically creates, at a minimum, a development environment, and a QA environment prior to
    migrating to a production environment, which may by modified or upgraded itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that reason, a series
    of test levels (system verification, system test, acceptance test plus others as needed) will be planned and executed
    on each environment.&nbsp; The tests are conducted in the same manner on each environment with the exception that more
    critical environments may include additional test types such as performance tests or security tests to ensure the
    infrastructure has the required capacity, and integrity to enable the application to be safely implemented.
</p>
<h5>
    Environments under Constant Change
</h5>
<p>
    It is highly likely, due to today’s rapid development demands, that environments are installed and implemented in
    logical groups of components to coincide with the application build delivery schedule.&nbsp; This represents an
    additional challenge on the Infrastructure tester who may have to iterate through tests conducted previously on an
    environment, as new hardware and software are added.&nbsp; Not only does this represent a potential for repeat testing
    but also there may be crucial timing issues.&nbsp; Testing of infrastructure and application builds may occur during a
    time period after which either application or environment may undergo additional change.
</p>
<h5>
    Concept of ‘Tracks’
</h5>
<p>
    A track is a work effort to deliver components of the infrastructure, typically in support of e-commerce
    applications.&nbsp; These components can be common functions used by many applications (security, content management,
    and directory services), or they can be facilities (such as physical systems and architecture.)&nbsp; Tracks are
    usually planned in such a manner as to coincide with application ‘Builds’ from Development and frequently in a
    scheduled delivery cycle such as in 90-day intervals.
</p>
<p>
    The following chart illustrates, from an application developer’s perspective, some of the issues associated with the
    interdependence of application and track release schedules.&nbsp; In this situation, tracks are being scheduled for
    release one-per-period, perhaps quarterly, and the content of each track must be coordinated such that it satisfies the
    need for development without holding up structural growth.

            </td>
            <td>
                Development begins with only an understanding of the function to be provided by the track releases.&nbsp;
                For example, an application developer may know that an authentication function will be provided, but he may
                not have the actual function available at that time.&nbsp; Development begins with stubs or other
                utilities. 
                <p>
                    In the illustration, Application 1 requires Track A release 1 and Track B release 1. Track components
                    are under way and application development is beginning even though the track releases are not
                    developed.

                <p>
                    In the illustration, part way through Period 2, Track A release 1 and Track B release 1 are available
                    and application system tests may begin. The track releases cannot go into production until they are
                    tested with all applications affected by those releases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Development of the later releases of the tracks can proceed in parallel, improving time to market.

                The application is released when acceptance testing is complete.&nbsp; Later releases of the tracks used by
                that application might have to be tested with the application depending on business risk. 
                <p>
                    In the illustration, part way through Period 3, Track A release 2 and Track B release 2 will be tested
                    with the now-implemented Application 1.0 before they are promoted into production.

</table><br />
<br />
<p>
    Just as in application development process, the track release process includes points in the process for business risk
    assessment, Quality Assurance, and determination of the levels of testing that will be performed.
</p>
<p>
    There is a need for flexibility in dealing with interdependencies of application and track releases.&nbsp; The time
    pressures of deploying e-commerce applications results in a need for very close cooperation.&nbsp; For example, there
    may be a need to negotiate the content of releases because of the complex interdependencies to keep to agreed
    schedules.
</p>
<p>
    Building flexibility into the process will allow an overlap of application development and test with track releases.
    Integrating testing into the release process will allow many tests to be run in parallel, improving time to market.
    Aligning the test process with the release process will require Quality Assurance involvement from the beginning of the
    design and will result in more realistic schedules.
</p>
<h3>
    6&nbsp;What Unique Tasks Should You Expect to Encounter in the Infrastructure Testing Engagement Model?
</h3>
<h5>
    Test Strategy Vs Master Test Plan
</h5>
<p>
    Depending upon the complexity and scope of the Infrastructure test, there may not be a need to develop a Master Test
    Plan.&nbsp; If conducting an Environment test on a single environment, for example, a Test Strategy will suffice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    A master test plan is recommended under the following conditions:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Multiple levels of testing are to be performed, such as testing on multiple environments<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing has to be coordinated with various application builds, in which case the application testing will require a
        master test plan anyway.&nbsp; In this case, one master test plan should include schedules for both Infrastructure
        and application test levels.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    A new test level – Environment Test
</h5>
<p>
    As shown in the diagram in section 4.0, an Environment Test is conducted on the Infrastructure without the use of
    business applications.&nbsp; In general, the purpose of an Environment test is to validate the system and system
    software and perform a system test.&nbsp; From an application developer’s perspective, an ‘Environment Test’ combines
    the testing levels of Unit test, Integration test and System Test.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Unit testing</strong> in the context of an infrastructure test means that the servers and their operating
    systems are verified to be at the correct levels and the network connections are allowing the servers to communicate
    properly.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Integration testing</strong> in the context of an infrastructure test means that the vendor software and
    services installed on the servers are verified to be at the correct levels and that their installation verification
    procedures and simple utilities indicate that they are properly installed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>System testing</strong> in the context of an infrastructure test means that the environment will be tested with
    an application driver that will exercise the functions of the system together as defined in the infrastructure use case
    scenarios.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Flexible Testing Levels based on risk, and client needs.&nbsp;
</h5>
<p>
    One testing approach, following an Environment test, would be to conduct an acceptance test and the engagement would
    end.&nbsp; However, since risk mitigation is limited without introducing application systems, further test levels are
    recommended.
</p>
<p>
    Unless Infrastructure Testing is integrated with other test engagements (e.g. Full Life Cycle test, e-business
    testing), Infrastructure test plans should consider a Systems Integration test, and Operability test to ensure the
    infrastructure adequately supports the critical systems being developed for the enterprise.
</p>
<h5>
    Specialized Testing
</h5>
<p>
    As shown in the diagram in section 4, ‘specialized’ testing such as Performance testing is planned separately but for
    the purposes of this EM, is appended and performed with a Systems Integration test.&nbsp; Each specialized test should
    have its own execution plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of all such tests are reported in the Systems Integration Test
    Report.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of specialized testing are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Security testing<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Performance testing, or variations such as Stress, Volume, or Scalability<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Business Continuity Testing (Backup & Recovery,&nbsp; Restore and Restart, Disaster Recovery)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Operability test<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Availability or Durability test
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    7&nbsp;Some Practical Suggestions for Approaching an Infrastructure Test
</h3>
<h5>
    Location and role of specialized testing
</h5>
<p>
    Security, Performance, Stress, Business Recovery, Scalability, Availability are all general names for testing which
    require expertise and specialized planning.&nbsp; Each may be conducted over the life of the Infrastructure test or may
    be isolated to very specific time periods or may be directed at specific parts of the environment.&nbsp; Expertise
    should be obtained prior to beginning any engagement in which such testing is a client requirement.
</p>
<h5>
    Baseline material to be collected
</h5>
<p>
    Prior to beginning any part of an Infrastructure test, existing material should be collected.&nbsp; There may a wealth
    of information already available in the forms of Architecture documents, or even baseline Performance data.&nbsp; Each
    of these work products may be valuable or may be useless, depending upon whether they are current or represent the
    Infrastructure in its current configuration.&nbsp; The validity of these documents should be validated.&nbsp; This is a
    useful exercise to conduct even if the material does not prove to be completely valid as it provides a useful
    historical perspective.&nbsp; Nonetheless, as validation can be a lengthy process, a realistic assessment is usually
    necessary to evaluate whether to collect new baseline material or rely on existing documents.
</p>
<h5>
    Tools&nbsp;
</h5>
<p>
    Obviously a large number of tools exist to assist with capturing and reporting results of an Infrastructure test.&nbsp;
    In most cases, the use of tools will be restricted due to budget considerations, client preferences or simply the time
    to obtain and install the software.&nbsp; Keep in mind when acquiring new tools or resurrecting old ones, to allow for
    time to research and obtain the right version of the product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Research the proper installation technique,
    train the users of the tool so that they can properly interpret results and test the tool so that it operates according
    to the supplier’ specifications and the user’s expectations.&nbsp; Finally, be cognizant that tools themselves may
    impact the results of the test.
</p>
<p>
    Although tool selection may have to be delayed until the complete details of the test plan are known it is recommended,
    for all the above reasons, the tools be implemented and set up on the environment they will be used to test, as early
    in the test cycle as possible.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to using features and services supplied by the operating system or by System software such as CICS or DB2,
    some of the more common tools used in Infrastructure testing include the following.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Load runner, Win Runner, and Test Director marketed by Mercury Interactive, with which IBM Procurement has a
        negotiated contract.&nbsp; These products are used for Load, Stress, Performance and Availability testing<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Silk Performer marketed by Seque, with which IBM Procurement has a negotiated contract.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Rational (SQA) Robot, PerformanceStudio, and SiteLoad by Rational Software, with which IBM Procurement has a
        negotiated contract.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        SET, and TPNS provided by IBM<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Optimal Application Expert (now called EcoScope) marketed by Compuware<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Network and Systems tools from Candle, W&G
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Risk Assessment
</h5>
<p>
    Infrastructure testing may be directed at a small portion of a critical environment or be focussed on several
    environments in a broad scale.&nbsp; Testing the Infrastructure can also be repetitive as changes are made to improve
    tuning, capacity or performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the scale of the test, there will be significant
    trade-offs.&nbsp; Be aware of the Risks, document them, and develop mitigation strategies.&nbsp; Present them to the
    client sponsor so that enlightened decisions may be made.
