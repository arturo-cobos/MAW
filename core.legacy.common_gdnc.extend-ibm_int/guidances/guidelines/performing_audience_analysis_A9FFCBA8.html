</table>The Audience Analysis provides the engagement team with an accurate audience description to enable the design of a
relevant, useful, and applicable learning solution. 
<p>
    This analysis identifies and documents characteristics of intended users. These characteristics include all information
    relevant to the design and development of the deliverables, such as average age of users, gender breakdown, computer
    literacy, etc.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Why Perform an Audience Analysis?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The primary benefits of an Audience Analysis include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Audience Analysis identifies the characteristics of the target audience, enabling the design of a learning
        solution that the audience will be able to use, will find engaging, and will be more likely to use than a solution
        developed for a general audience.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Audience Analysis will identify any special needs of the target audience, such as the need for media to suppose
        on-screen text or the need for using language at a particular grade level.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Audience Analysis will help the Instructional Designer identify the most appropriate theme and treatment for
        the learning solution, and will serve as an aid for designing any real-life scenarios that may be scripted as part
        of the solution.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>When Should You Perform an Audience Analysis?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once the need for a learning intervention has been identified, an Audience Analysis is typically performed when the
    characteristics of the audience are varied or unknown, especially in the following situations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scenarios and simulations related to real-life job situations are needed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The audience has exhibited a past lack of interest in or unwillingness to finish learning solutions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A high level of participation is expected on the part of participants.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3&nbsp; Steps
</h3>
<p>
    The following is meant as guidance only. There are many methods for conducting an Audience Analysis. Please refer to
    the “Tools” section to view some available resources.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify the audience characteristics that are relevant to the design of the learning solution. These
        characteristics may include (but are not limited to) one or more of the following: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Age
            </li>
            <li>
                Gender
            </li>
            <li>
                Education
            </li>
            <li>
                Primary language
            </li>
            <li>
                Familiarity with technology
            </li>
            <li>
                Amount of free time available for training
            </li>
            <li>
                Attitude to training
            </li>
            <li>
                Rate of turnover in job role<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct a meeting with the project sponsor, to identify who makes up the target audience. Gather names of some
        representatives.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Schedule meetings with the representatives named in the meeting with the project sponsor. Gather information
        related to the characteristics identified in step one.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If the target audience is a large one (more than 200 individuals), consider developing an informal survey to submit
        to audience members.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a table with three columns:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Characteristic – In this column, list the characteristics identified in step 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Description – In this column, list the findings from steps 3 and 4.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design Implications – In this column, indicate the way in which the design of the learning solution will
                support the specific characteristics of the audience.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These findings should be included in any standards documentation for the engagement.
</p>
