<p>
    The Training Needs Analysis technique is the early stage of curriculum development for any client engagement. This
    Analysis is to be perceived, resourced and conducted as a single activity with the results being routed through to
    specific, appropriate work products.
</p>Training Needs Analysis Report defines the training activities required to support an implementation. The report is
used by the training developers when structuring course curriculum, initiating Subject Matter Expert (SME) contacts, and
delineating course content. It typically contains key assumptions, delivery methods, roles and responsibilities,
descriptions of the training program, methods used in the Training Needs Analysis process, and the resultant course
analysis.

</table><b>Inputs</b> 
<p>
    Training Needs Analysis consists of a review of the existing project documents, a high-level evaluation of the software
    (tools) for training development, correspondence with client personnel, interviews with client and IBM project staff
    and other IBM resources, and training related project presentations.

</table>The Training Needs Analysis Report is intended for members of the following areas: <br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Business Process Owners
    </li>

        Business Team Leads
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    1.&nbsp;Research Available Materials and Identify Potential Courses
</p>
<p>
    The first step of the training needs analysis is the review of the existing project documents, correspondence with
    client personnel and any training related project presentations. These materials include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project Scope<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Business Strategy documents<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Organization Plans, project description, budgets<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Current and furture organization(s)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Skills and capabilities<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Current IT environment<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        IT Vision (mission, goals, objectives)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other activities to be conducted in parallel with the document review are a high-level evaluation of the software
    (tools) for training development, interviews with client and IBM project staff and other IBM resources, and a review of
    the courses originally identified in the Education and Training Strategy document.
</p>
<p>
    This step concludes, using this draft curriculum as a starting point, with a re-evaluation and benchmarking of the
    training needs analysis against comparable implementations.
</p>
<p>
    2.&nbsp;Meet with Business Team Leads, BPR Team and Related Roles
</p>
<p>
    Engage the Process Team members in a dialogue concerning the proposed training strategy. Discussion points must
    include: delivery method for each of the proposed courses, targeted audience per course, sequencing of courses
    (predecessors), roles and responsibilities for content development, and technical development in the case of
    e-learning, computer-based training or web based training.
</p>
<p>
    3.&nbsp;Document and Summarize Courses
</p>
<p>
    Training initiatives deliver education at three different levels. They include foundation training, business process
    overview training, and role based training. Categorize each of the proposed courses into one of these three levels. It
    is important to document the discussion points listed in step 2 for each of the courses.
</p>
<p>
    Three different levels:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Foundation Training&nbsp; - delivery of basic knowledge and skills which must be learned prior to attending
        business proceess overview training.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Business Process Overview Training – explanation of new business process knowledge that end-users must acquire in
        order to better understand Role Based Training.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Role Based Training – development of skillsets necessary for end-user success in their post-implementation roles.
    </li>
</ol></td>
