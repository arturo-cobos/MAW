    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    The objective of this technique is to assist in discovering knowledge surpluses and shortfalls within an organization
    given the business strategy set forth by senior management.&nbsp; The purpose of this analysis presumes a belief that
    any and all initiatives to manage knowledge should focus on the knowledge needed to fulfill the business strategy as
    well as any excess knowledge within an organization that has the greatest chance of enhancing organizational
    value.&nbsp; More specifically, only through analyzing gaps between and among existing, required, competitor, partner,
    and customer knowledge can a knowledge management program be recommended that will in fact prioritize and then manage
    the most strategic knowledge to the organization.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Step 1 - Determine Client's Knowledge Requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Review the client's knowledge requirements.&nbsp; Through interviews with senior executives as well as through
    compilations of self directed and company directed sources, determine the knowledge that is required to formulate and
    implement the corporate, business, and functional strategy.&nbsp; The knowledge in question should be rated using a
    scale consisting of attributes such as "unique, rare, exploitable, valuable, and defensible" in order to determine the
    degree to which the knowledge in question provides a strategic advantage.&nbsp; Moreover, the knowledge should be
    evaluated by degree of dynamism given that knowledge is rarely static; competitive environments that are dynamic often
    require faster and more extensive learning to keep knowledge current.&nbsp; Organizations’ learning capabilities must
    match the learning requirements of their competitive environment.&nbsp; Therefore, each area of knowledge should be
    evaluated as to the extent and intensity of learning required.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 - Determine Client's Existing Knowledge
</h4>
<p>
    Review the client's existing knowledge.&nbsp; Through interviews with senior executives, company directed sources, and
    other content analysis techniques (see technique paper for Assessing Knowledge Content) determine what the company
    actually knows.&nbsp; Once this knowledge is determined, separate that knowledge into knowledge that is required to
    formulate and implement the business strategy as well as knowledge that exists, however is currently not being
    exploited to a degree that may provide further strategic advantage for the company.&nbsp; As with the knowledge
    requirement analysis in step one, existing knowledge should be rated on both a strategicness and dynamism scale.&nbsp;
    Moreover, it would be beneficial at this point to detect if and how the company measures the knowledge that they
    have.&nbsp; Lack or existence of measurement initiatives helps to shed light on how serious the company is about
    competing on and managing their knowledge.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 - Determine Client's Competitor, Customer, and Partner Knowledge
</h4>
<p>
    Review the client's competitor, customer, and partner knowledge. Even though firms may posses the necessary knowledge
    and capabilities to secure their strategy, companies must evaluate the extent to which other firms are competing on the
    same knowledge.&nbsp; For instance, if the knowledge in question is basic and thus common to many firms, the knowledge
    is probably not very strategic and easily duplicated.&nbsp; This analysis aids in creating a complete picture of the
    strategic value of a firm’s knowledge.&nbsp; Through interviews with client employees, emphasizing marketing or
    business intelligence camps, as well as company directed sources and other market analysis techniques, determine what
    the client's competitors, customers, and partners know.&nbsp; Although this may seem to be a daunting task, concentrate
    on that knowledge that would represent an opportunity or threat to the client.&nbsp; The knowledge should once again be
    ranked by degree of strategicness and dynamism so as to aid in determining which knowledge would be most strategic,
    relevant, and efficient to manage.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4 - Determine Client's Strategic Knowledge Surpluses & Shortfalls
</h4>
<p>
    Review the client's knowledge gaps. Knowledge management will have the most fundamental impact on the health of the
    firm if it is directed at closing strategic knowledge gaps that represent knowledge deficiencies or exploiting gaps
    that represent knowledge expertise but that is being potentially under-exploited.&nbsp; Through interviews with the
    client, however concentrating more on information that has already been documented in
</p>
<p>
    Steps 1-3, determine the possible surpluses and shortfalls between…
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The firm's existing knowledge and their required knowledge.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The firm's existing knowledge and their competitors', customers', and partners' knowledge.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The firm's existing learning capabilities and their required learning capabilities.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The firm's existing learning capabilities and their competitors', customers', and partners' learning capabilities.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 5 - Determine Client's Knowledge Management & Learning Program Alignment
</h4>
<p>
    Determine how well the client's knowledge management and learning capabilities address their strategic knowledge
    requirements.&nbsp; After conducting a comprehensive scan of the client's knowledge management and learning programs
    determine if a strategic fit exists between the current knowledge management and learning programs and the knowledge
    surpluses and shortfalls. Consider those surpluses and shortfalls within the company that are related to the client's
    corporate, functional, and business strategy, goals, mission, and vision.&nbsp; Misalignment will represent an
    opportunity for the client to utilize knowledge management and learning techniques that properly address the existing
    chasms.&nbsp; Alignment will also represent an opportunity for the client to enhance existing knowledge management and
    learning programs by way of making them more time efficient, less costly, etc.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Potential Next Step(s)
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Thorough gap analysis, categorize data according to a framework that is in the client's best interests.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Story construction (see Technique Paper for Storyboarding for Design) that codifies the analysis, using concrete
        examples where necessary, to create an easy to understand current state picture for the client.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Produce report & presentation for client to discuss present state and promote acceptance.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct workshop with client to present preliminary results…<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirm accuracy and completeness of findings and observations<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Prioritize gaps and remedies<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss implications&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Alter knowledge management initiatives to fit knowledge surplus and shortfall<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Alter business strategy to fit knowledge and learning capabilities
    </li>
