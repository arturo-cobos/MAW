    There are a few widely used Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) such as DB2 UDB, Oracle, Sybase, and
    Informix. Although they have the same goal, their implementations are quite different. This TP provides a generic
    approach to sizing a database server and then points to tools specific to each.
</p>

<h3>
    2&nbsp;Starting Point for Sizing RDBMS
</h3>
<p>
    The real problem of sizing RDBMS is accuracy. Initial sizing is a prediction based on few or no facts. Ideally, you
    should understand the following when sizing an RDBMS server:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Complexity of the transactions
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction rate
    </li>
    <li>
        Read / write ratio
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of concurrent connections
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of concurrent transactions
    </li>
    <li>
        Sizes of the largest table
    </li>
    <li>
        Performance objectives 
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Throughput
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Maintenance windows such as backup, re-org, load
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the following sections we are going to cover the general rules based on the results of experience in system sizing,
    benchmarks, and performance tuning.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;RDBMS utilization
</h3>
<p>
    These utilization figures are the results of benchmarks and monitoring well balance and high performance production
    systems.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="294" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/rdbms_table1.JPG" width="598" /><br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>-Network:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    30 percent of theoretical network bandwidth stops collisions on an Ethernet type network from becoming a problem, which
    reduces throughput. Token ring type networks can be driven to 60 percent with no drop in throughput.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>- Paging Space:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If your system is small and has many users, we recommend three times memory. If your system is large, some systems go
    below this size because lots of memory is used for the RDBMS cache and it therefore does not need paging space.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Sizing RDBMS
</h3>
<p>
    The following formulas work best for UNIX based platforms.&nbsp; If sizing on NT or W2K use the platform specific tool
    in the tools section.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sizing memory</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To size the amount of memory required, the number of concurrent users and the query workload characteristics should be
    considered. More users require more memory. Large DSS style scan queries may not require as much because no amount of
    memory can contain the huge volumes of data. Smaller and indexed based complex queries can make use of more memory to
    cache data.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not have any information such as the number of concurrent users and the query workload characteristics,
    memory can very roughly be sized as five percent of the raw data size plus OS requirements and 32 MB for RDBMS
    processes.
</p>
<p>
    If you have the necessary information, the following a formula that can be used to compute necessary memory more
    accurately:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Add all of the following:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>+Memory required for OS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>+ RDBMS_code</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>+ RDMBS_data_cache</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>+ (Users * Application_Resident_Set)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>+ Filesystem Cache</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>See the following descriptions for the formula.&nbsp; An example of using this formula is shown later in this
    document.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>- OS: Start with the memory required for the operating system.&nbsp; (Example: AIX requires 64MB)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>- RDBMS_code: Add how much memory the actual code will require.&nbsp; (Recommend at least 32 MB)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>- Application Resident Set:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is the code and data of the application that each user needs to run. The resident set refers to the fact that a
    paging system does not need to have the entire program in memory to run and usually only a proportion of the
    application is required.&nbsp; If the exact application resident set is unavailable, the following is a starting point:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We recommend for a simple application coded, for example, in an efficient development language such as C to use 2
        MB per user.
    </li>
    <li>
        We recommend for a more complex application with a lot of functions or written in a modern 4GL environment to use 6
        MB for each user.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>-RDBMS data cache</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If the RDBMS data is held in file systems, a large file system cache is required. If the RDBMS data is held in raw
    disks such as VSD, then the file system size can be reduced in favor of more RDBMS cache. Rules of thumb are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A minimum of 32 MB is required for the combined caches.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        For an OLTP application a good starting point would be to use five percent for data disk size (means raw data size
        plus header of RDBMS, 5 - 10 percent is recommended as a rule of thumb) for the RDBMS data cache.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For setting the size of the RDBMS cache in practice production the following is used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Start point if you have no information is half of memory for the RDBMS cache.
    </li>
    <li>
        In OLTP systems the cache is often higher, such as 70 percent of memory, to ensure the most often used tables and
        rows are always in memory.
    </li>
    <li>
        In many complex CPU heavy applications and Business Intelligence (BI) or DSS workloads use less memory, such as 30
        percent of memory, for the RDBMS cache if they effectively have to read large proportions of the database to answer
        SQL statements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>-File system cache</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The file system cache is used by the operating system to save copies of recently used disk locks. It avoids disk I/O
    for performance. Even if the RDBMS uses raw devices (including Oracle on SP using the VSD raw devices), the system
    needs some file system cache. When the RDBMS uses the file system cache, a balance must be made between RDBMS cache and
    filesystem cache (in the ratio 3 to 1). The combined size will be similar to the RDBMS cache size for raw device
    databases.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sizing Processor</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There is no generic approach to sizing processor(s).&nbsp; To determine this you should study benchmarks specific to
    the hardware platform you are running.&nbsp; It is, however, considerably easier to decide on processing power now that
    you have estimated how much memory you will require.&nbsp; IBM benchmarks can be found at <a href="http://www.spec.org/">http://www.spec.org/</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sizing Disk Space</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The disk space can be very roughly sized via following raw data to disk space ratios as a rule of thumb. If you do not
    have any information, use 1: 3 raw data to disk space ratio.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        OLTP Ratio 1 : 3 to 1 : 4
    </li>
    <li>
        DSS Ratio 1 : 4 to 1 : 5
    </li>
    <li>
        Data Warehouse Ratio 1 : 5 to 1 : 7
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example, your raw data size was 300 GB on a DSS environment, 1.2 TB - 1.5 TB non-mirrored or 2.4 TB - 3.0 TB
    mirrored disk space is required.
</p>
<p>
    The prime RDBMS data parts of any RDBMS are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Data: User data are contained.
    </li>
    <li>
        Index: This is almost the same size as data.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tmp/sort: This is used for creating indexes and sorting temporary tables during SQL statements, which can be larger
        than the largest table in the database.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    You should add the RDBMS header for each part mentioned above. It can be roughly estimated from raw data size plus the
    header of RDBMS; 10 percent is recommended as a rule of thumb.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sizing the Number of Disks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This will depend greatly on the disk drives available for the system you are sizing.&nbsp; You should decide which disk
    drive is good for your system based on database size and considering I/O requirements. Many small disks increase the
    I/O throughput but require extra adapters and PCI bus slots. Larger disks are generally less expensive per GB of
    storage.
</p>
<h3>
    5&nbsp;Sizing Example
</h3>
<p>
    We are going to size the database system for an imaginary corporation Corporation.com. Some of the information below is
    only necessary to compute processing power, which is not done in the example.&nbsp; The assumed transactions of
    Corporation.com are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Peak Time: 10:00 - 11:00 = 1 hour = 3600 seconds
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction type: Typical simple application without complex queries
    </li>
    <li>
        The number of users 
        <ul>
            <li>
                - Light = 2000
            </li>
            <li>
                - Medium = 50
            </li>
            <li>
                - Heavy = 5
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The number of transaction per user in the peak period
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                - Light = 120 transactions / user
            </li>
            <li>
                - Medium = 60 transactions / user
            </li>
            <li>
                - Heavy = 15 transactions / user
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        CPU seconds per transaction on a 1 Rel.OLTP machine
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                - Light = 1
            </li>
            <li>
                - Medium = 3
            </li>
            <li>
                - Heavy = 15
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Maximum CPU utilization: 60 percent
    </li>
    <li>
        Raw data size: 100 GB
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Step 1: Sizing memory</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We can calculate the amount of memory using the formula mentioned above in the&nbsp; “Sizing memory” portion. We assume
    the RDBMS is based on raw devices, and application resident set size is 4 MB.&nbsp; We are also assuming AIX for OS
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Memory = AIX
</p>
<p>
    + RDBMS_code
</p>
<p>
    + RDBMS_data_cache
</p>
<p>
    + (User * Application_Resident_Set)
</p>
<p>
    + Filesystem_Cache
</p>
<p>
    = 64 required for AIX
</p>
<p>
    + 32  standard amount required for RDBMS_data_cache
</p>
<p>
    + (100 * 0.05 * 1024)  Variable amt required (Five percent of Raw data size plus header of RDBMS)
</p>
<p>
    + (2000 + 50 + 5) * 4  Number of users multiplied by application resident size (4MB)
</p>
<p>
    + 32  File system cache
</p>
<p>
    = 13468 MB = 13.5 GB
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Two: Sizing Disk</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We assume the RDBMS header is 10 percent of raw data size. The application of Corporation.com is a typical OLTP
    application. So, we can use 1: 3 ratio, but in this case we consider the RDBMS header and we assume the ratio of Data:
    Index: Tmp / Sort = 1: 1: 1. The total size of data is estimated as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        RDBMS Data = 100 GB + 10 percent = 110 GB
    </li>
    <li>
        RDBMS Index = 100 GB + 10 percent = 110 GB
    </li>
    <li>
        RDBMS Tmp / Sort = 100 GB + 10 percent = 110 GB
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Therefore, the total size of data is 330 GB. You should consider the disks for AIX, paging space, and RDBMS log. We
    recommend one disk for each.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Three: Sizing the number of disks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The application of Corporation.com is a typical OLTP application, so 10 – 20 small disks for each CPU are recommended.
    We chose 9.1 GB SSA disks. We decide to use mirroring of AIX LVM for disk protection.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Data: 110 GB / 8.75 * 2 mirror = 26 disks
    </li>
    <li>
        Index: 110 GB / 8.75 * 2 mirror = 26 disks
    </li>
    <li>
        Tmp / sort: 110 GB / 8.75 * 2 mirror = 26 disks
    </li>
    <li>
        1 RDBMS log * 2 mirror = 2 disks per node
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Moreover, four 9.1 GB SCSI internal disks are needed for AIX and paging space using LVM mirroring.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Four: Sizing Processor</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Study appropriate benchmarks, and make a selection taking into account the amount of RAM you determined and any other
    factors you have available such as complexity of transactions, number of users during peak time, maximum CPU
    utilization, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step Five: Configure System</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Memory: 13.5 GB
    </li>
    <li>
        Disk space: 330 GB plus disk protection
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of disks: 80 disks for data and log, 4 disks for AIX and paging space
    </li>
</ul>
