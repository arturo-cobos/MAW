</table>IBM professionals involved in engineering a learning solution include the following: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Instructional Designers
    </li>
    <li>
        Information Developers
    </li>
    <li>
        Application Developers
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    Within Custom Learning Content Development engagement, the Engineer Solution task results in the valuable product of
    the engagement: the learning solution itself. Typically, the solution will take the form of one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A Technology-Based Solution, such as Web-Based Training (WBT), Computer-Based Training (CBT) delivered via CD-ROM,
        or an Enhanced Performance Support System (EPSS).
    </li>
    <li>
        An Instructor-Led solution, such as a classroom course.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Blended solution that includes some combination of the above.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the type of learning solution that is to be delivered to the client, “engineering” may take on one of
    several meanings. However, the net result is the same, regardless of the chosen delivery strategy: a complete learning
    solution, including all components needed to begin delivering the solution to the target audience.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    The following is meant as guidance only. There are many methods for engineering a learning solution. Here, three
    possible approaches are outlined, one for Technology-Based Solutions, one for Instructor-Led Solutions, and one for
    Blended Solutions.
</p>
<h4>
    3.1 Technology-Based Solutions
</h4>
<p>
    Once the required elements have been created (learning solution script and supporting media), the following general
    steps are taken to engineer the final solution:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Ensure that all needed elements are available, as outlined in the Detailed Design Document. These may include (but
        are not limited to) any or all of the following: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Scripted text
            </li>
            <li>
                Audio narration
            </li>
            <li>
                Audio music
            </li>
            <li>
                Audio sound effects
            </li>
            <li>
                Video
            </li>
            <li>
                Animations
            </li>
            <li>
                Complex technology-based interactions (such as Flash elements)
            </li>
            <li>
                Photographs, illustrations, diagrams, or other graphic elements<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Depending on the development tool being used, at this point text and supporting media are either “dropped into” the
        solution, or the solution is coded and media is placed appropriately.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The solution is “published,” creating an executable file from which the solution may be launched.<br />
        In the case of Technology-Based solutions, the solution engineer typically requires some programming or other
        technical skill.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    3.2 Instructor-Led Solutions
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Ensure that all needed elements are available, as outlined in the Detailed Design Document. These may include (but
        are not limited to) any or all of the following: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Scripted text
            </li>
            <li>
                Photographs, illustrations, diagrams, or other graphic elements
            </li>
            <li>
                Video
            </li>
            <li>
                Simulations, games, or other materials needed for classroom activities<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Assemble the elements into the components of the final deliverable. These components may include (but are not
        limited to) any of the following:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Student notebooks
            </li>
            <li>
                Student exercise guides
            </li>
            <li>
                Instructor guides
            </li>
            <li>
                Instructor exercise guides
            </li>
            <li>
                Presentation materials
            </li>
            <li>
                Lab setup guide
            </li>
            <li>
                Materials in support of classroom activities or games<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The solution is “published” as a package of all solution-related elements.<br />
        In the case of an Instructor-Led solution, the solution engineer need not possess programming or other technical
        skills, but will typically require familiarity with at least one technology-based development tool or system.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    3.3 Blended Solutions
</h4>
<p>
    The steps taken to engineer a blended solution are much the same as those taken to engineer a Technology-Based or
    Instructor-Led solution, with any needed adaptations. In the case of a Blended solution, at least one of the solution
    engineers will typically require some skills in the area of programming.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Tools
</h3>
<p>
    The following are among the tools used to develop and engineer learning solutions (Please note that this does not
    include those applications used to create supporting materials, such as audio and graphics files):
