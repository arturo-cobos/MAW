    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    The results of the rapid infrastructure sizing assessment (arriving between 5 and 10 days) will be used as a guide to
    the deployment of the RID engagement. The point of the task is not to assess the sizing strategy of the client for
    yourself, but to gather correct and sufficient information for the Capacity Planning Team to make a rapid assessment.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    Capacity planning is more cost-effective and efficient if done prior to deployment.&nbsp; Performance problems
    resulting from a lack of capacity are more complex and costly to resolve after deployment.&nbsp; Capacity planning
    provides the information needed to strategically assess future IT requirements for new equipment, additional network
    capacity, and new, underlying IT architectures.&nbsp; Engaging an independent organization experienced in
    Web-application, system and, network architectures helps ensure an unbiased analysis of application resource
    requirements.&nbsp; This in turn helps the deployment team to adequately prepare systems and networks for new traffic
    loads.
</p>
<h4>
    2.1&nbsp; Best Approach
</h4>
<p>
    There are two developed methodologies that can help IBM assess resource requirements for new Web-based applications.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Architectural sizings</em></strong> employ architectural design points and benchmark data to identify
    needed resources. Organizations must size the project and estimate resources before the application is developed to
    ensure that the development team is given accurate feasibility input. If the ROI is unattractive, the application may
    need to be redesigned, or management may decide to drop the development project altogether.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Test-based sizings</em></strong> use testing results to simulate user-access scenarios and running
    production-level code. These results, along with base user information, validate architectural sizings and finalize
    deployment system resource requirements. If there is any discrepancy in the sizings, incorrect input from the
    development application team may be the cause.
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, both types of sizings should be performed.&nbsp; However, development activities may cause one or the other to
    be bypassed.&nbsp; If an application is delayed in development but must be in production by a predefined date,
    test-based sizing can be performed while the application is being deployed.&nbsp; The Capacity Planning Team will help
    you decide which approach is most appropriate for the engagement.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    3.1&nbsp; Gather Preliminary Data
</h4>
<p>
    Prior to contacting the Capacity Planning Team, try to gather as much information as possible about the client’s
    architectural plan.&nbsp; Recommended documents and information to have available include:&nbsp; diagram of client
    infrastructure and components (including backend architecture, servers, routers, etc.); list of planned or installed
    applications, middleware; statistics about the total and potential volume of transactions, number of end users,
    possible concurrent usage, and usage patterns (daily/seasonal peaks, anticipated specific use patterns); transaction
    volumes over periods of time; hardware platforms; size and scope of the engagement and infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    Having all of this information ready and available before your initial call to the Sizing Team is rare and not
    mandatory, but it may help produce more speedy results.&nbsp; The Sizing Team prefers soft copies whenever possible,
    but will also accept faxes of key documents.&nbsp; (A sample questionnaire is included in Appendix A to help organize
    the preliminary data.)&nbsp; Remember, all of the questions need not be answered completely, but should be addressed if
    the information is already easily available to you.
</p>
<h4>
    3.2&nbsp; Contact Capacity Planning Team
</h4>
<p>
    Call the e-business Sizing Control Desk to set up a conference call to discuss components and sizing.&nbsp; The initial
    call will serve 2 purposes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Inform the team leader of the size of the project so that he/she may be better able to staff the Sizing Team to
        accommodate the RID Team’s needs.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To plan a 2-hour conference call within one business day at the earliest to determine strategy, requirements, and
        estimated date of completion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Sizing Team leader will request CLAIM codes for the project on this initial call or on the conference call, so that
    work may begin as soon as the data is submitted.&nbsp; During the conference call be sure to bring up any questions or
    additional requirement regarding the delivery of the solution.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
    Because each engagement and each client’s infrastructure will vary widely from previous ones, there is no standardized
    template by which a practitioner may gather needed information from the client.&nbsp; By the end of the conference
    call, however, the team will be able to supply the RID Team with a tailored template that will waste little time and
    effort on the data collection effort.
</p>
<h4>
    3.3&nbsp; Gather and Submit Infrastructure Data
</h4>
<p>
    To properly determine resource requirements for an application, the capacity planning team requires architectural
    information, along with a functional description of anticipated usage.&nbsp; The completeness and accuracy of the
    sizing depends on the quality of the information received.&nbsp; When portions of information are unknown or missing,
    the risk factor for incorrect sizing increases.&nbsp; (See Appendix B for a list of the types of information the Sizing
    Team uses to perform an assessment.&nbsp; This list is not exhaustive.)
</p>
<p>
    The practitioner should expect to gather the bulk of the requested information from the client after the conference
    call described above.&nbsp; This can be done by person-to-person interview or by phone with client
    representative.&nbsp; Experience shows that the best individuals from which to gather the data are a combination of the
    client’s Infrastructure Architect, and a person who acts as an end user representative (usually the owner of the
    solution).&nbsp; Combined, these 2 people can provide the most accurate data in the least amount of time.
</p>
<p>
    Once the requested information has been gathered from the client, submit it as soon as possible vi email to the
    Capacity Planning Team so that they may begin analyzing and assessing the sizing.&nbsp; Most rapid sizings take about 3
    weeks or less, but may last as long as 6 weeks, depending on the quality and quantity of information provided, and the
    size of the client’s infrastructure.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    3.4&nbsp; Receiving Sizing Assessment
</h4>
<p>
    Once the capacity team has the information for the sizing, it can apply standard calculations to produce results.&nbsp;
    The capacity assessment report will include a recommendation and risk factor associated with the recommendation. The
    RID team will receive the results of the assessment in document format, unless otherwise specified on the first
    conference call.&nbsp; Tabular or spreadsheet formats are available upon request.
</p>
<p>
    The confidentiality level of the resulting assessment is Class 2, and can be shared with the client.&nbsp; The RID team
    is advised that the assessment should inherit the confidentiality level of other documents exchanged between the IBM
    Team and Client Team.
</p>
<p>
    Should the RID Team need further clarification of the sizing assessment, they are encouraged to contact the Capacity
    Planning Team leader if needed.
