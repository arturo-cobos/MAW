    Description
</h3>
<p>
    The KM Discovery Workshop (DW) is a tool-driven session focused on identifying a clear direction for application of
    Knowledge Management (KM) in the client's organization. The Discovery Workshop is designed to simplify the gathering
    and collection of information, through a transition from theoretical enthusiasm to concrete ideas. The session will
    enable participants to understand the major issues associated with Knowledge Management, discover what the value of KM
    is to their organization and agree how their company needs to proceed in undertaking a Knowledge Management (KM)
    initiative.
</p>The workshop consists of a series of presentations, team-building, experiential and collaborative sessions presented
through a set of steps and exercises. This workshop enables participants to carry out simultaneous discussions, vote, etc.
in a fast moving, anonymous way, thus facilitating the achievement of true-commitment and buy-in. Tailoring the workshop to
meet client needs and requirements is encouraged. 
<p>
    <b><i>Note:</i></b> It may be useful to review the e-business Focal Area ("Killer-e") Workshop technique paper. It
    documents alternative and helpful techniques for determining how e-business (or KM) can be used to change the nature of
    business relationships.

<h3>
    Pre-Workshop Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Step 1 – Identify Participants
</h4>
<p>
    In order for a KM project to succeed, it is important to have the right people involved.&nbsp; The following list
    highlights what should be regarded as "required" criteria for participation in a KM project.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Engaging those who understand the impact of such issues like collaboration and innovation, and who represent lead cost
    and revenue drivers for the business will lead to the success of a KM project.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Make your selections wisely!</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify groups within the client’s organization to participate in the KM initiative based on the following
        criteria: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;High-value at the core of the group
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Strong, passionate sponsorship within it
            </li>
            <li>
                Globally dispersed (unless that poses an unrealistic challenge
            </li>
            <li>
                Workable size
            </li>
            <li>
                Represents or controls a major cost driver for the business
            </li>
            <li>
                Represents or controls a major revenue driver for the business
            </li>
            <li>
                Strategically significant to the business
            </li>
            <li>
                Willing and able to undertake a KM project
            </li>
            <li>
                Agreement from executive sponsor<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify <strong><em>individuals</em></strong> within the client’s organization to participate in the KM initiative
        based on the following criteria:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Subject matter expertise (of the work done by their group)
            </li>
            <li>
                Respected by their peers
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work product:</strong>
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 – Perform a Background Interview And Refine Candidate List (collect information on participant’s issues)
</h4>
<p>
    There should be an unbroken chain of sponsorship in place with the client.&nbsp; Individuals should be briefed by their
    management prior to conducting interviews.
</p>
<p>
    Avoid using an interview guide for this step.&nbsp; This should be more of a discussion to obtain the insights of the
    participant.
</p>
<p>
    Note:&nbsp; There may be a need to iterate between Steps 1 & 2 as information and insights gathered in the
    interviews may warrant revisiting group and individual selection.
</p>
<p>
    Schedule conference calls with candidates
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Quick brief on what is KM and their business<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What comes to mind with KM<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        How do you work?&nbsp; (a day in the life of a …)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Review shelf documentation (org charts, etc.)
</p>
<p>
    Update client sponsor
</p>
<p>
    Produce a purpose statement in conjunction with IBM rep and client interface<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 – Schedule Workshop
</h4>
<p>
    Like all workshops we conduct, consider which times of the day and particular days of the week will be most effective
    in a given client environment (e.g., do not schedule a workshop for a Friday afternoon prior to a holiday weekend).
</p>
<p>
    Be sure you clearly communicate the meeting room needs to your client including supplies, audio-visual equipment,
    refreshments, etc.&nbsp; (Materials required to conduct each exercise are included in each of the exercise tools
    presentations which can be found on the KM ICM database).&nbsp; Where possible, have the client make the necessary room
    arrangements.
</p>
<p>
    Also, it is good practice to keep the number of participants for each workshop to 4 – 8.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Premised on IBM consultant coming out for one trip to do all the workshops (assume 4 hours per exercise)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify key people within groups and check their availability<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Other invitees at request of client interface<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Client to handle meeting room arrangements and logistics<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Letter to sponsor with three selected groups and their available dates<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop simple kickoff packet including letter to participants from client sponsor
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 4 – Invite Attendees
</h4>
<p>
    This step is most effectively executed by the client sponsor and/or the individual's manager.&nbsp; Be prepared to help
    your client craft an appropriate invitation for distribution to the desired participants.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Step 5 – Tailor Workshop Design as Required
</h4>
<p>
    Choose from the following list of tools and exercises to design a workshop that will effectively gather the information
    needed to begin to understand the KM requirements at your client.
</p>
<p>
    The tools/exercises can be used as part of a Discovery Workshop or separately as appropriate.&nbsp; These tools can be
    found on the KM AssetWeb database.&nbsp; They include&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Covenanting Workshop<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        KM Burning Building Exercise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        KM Future Visioning Exercise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        KM Visioning Statement Exercise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        KM 12 Month Project Wish List Exercise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify Potential Interventions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine Business Value<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine Next Steps
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 6 – Prepare Workshop Materials
</h4>
<p>
    Again, you can find the tools/exercises on the KM AssetWeb database.&nbsp; Each tool has a section entitled "Before you
    start...”.&nbsp; Review these sections for each of the planned exercises.&nbsp; Be sure arrangements are made to have
    all needed materials and supplies in place.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Step 7 – Develop Workshop Agenda
</h4>
<p>
    Develop the tailored Agenda for the workshop.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
    An example Agenda is outlined below:<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Example Discovery Workshop Agenda</u></strong>

</p>
<h4>
    Step 8 – Conduct Knowledge Management Overview
</h4>
<p>
    Use the KM Executive Overview Presentation and KM Videoclips to prep the client on Knowledge Management.&nbsp; This is
    use<br />
    Tip:&nbsp; Be sure you clearly communicate the meeting room needs to your client including supplies, audio-visual
    equipment, refreshments, etc.&nbsp; (Materials required to conduct each exercise are included in each of the exercise
    tools).&nbsp; Where possible, have the client make the necessary room arrangements.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        KM awareness and education session<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Purpose (w/respect to later workshops) was to level set participants on KM concepts and rationale<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Two 90-minute sessions, back to back<br />

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Workshop</strong><br />
</p>
<h4>
    Step 9 – Conduct Workshop
</h4>
<p>
    Using the KM Discovery Workshop Agenda included in this Toolkit in the Tools section as a guide, or your revised
    agenda, as well as the Exercise Tools listed below:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Discovery Workshop Agenda<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        KM Burning Building Exercise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        KM Future Visioning Exercise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        KM Visioning Statement Exercise<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        KM 12 Month Project Wish List Exercise<br />

    <li>
        Identify Potential Interventions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine Business Value<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine Next Steps
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Tip:&nbsp; While it is always desirable to have each of the consultants delivering the workshop do so on a billable
    basis, consider using a non-billable consultant as a "scribe" for educational purposes.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sample Workshop…</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Discovery Workshops<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Staffed by lead facilitator (Rich) and a co-facilitator (Nancy).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        "Burning Building" exercise to identify key pieces of knowledge.&nbsp; Output is a prioritized list<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Future visioning exercise - imagine the ideal KM environment...what does it look like?&nbsp; Ends with grouping of
        clusters and labeling of groups.&nbsp; "Stake in the ground" for what it could be like.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Business value exercise to determine relative value of each piece of knowledge or key information&nbsp; 
        <ul>
            <li>
                How would business value be demonstrated?&nbsp; (e.g., reduced cycle time?)
            </li>
            <li>
                Are we missing something - -pros and cons<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Closing 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Tell them the steps you will take to process the workshop output
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Tell them that they will receive a summary document and that there will a follow-up discussion to get
                their thoughts on it
            </li>
            <li>
                Thank you and goodbye
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Post-Workshop Steps</strong>
</p>
<h4>
    Step 10&nbsp; – Perform Consultant Team Debrief
</h4>
<p>
    Arrange to conduct this debrief as soon after the completion of the Discovery Workshop as possible, while thoughts and
    perspectives are still fresh.
</p>
<p>
    Verbally debrief with the delivery team - - discuss what we each saw.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Step 11 – Generate a Summary Document
</h4>
<p>
    Put together a brief summary document of the workshop.&nbsp; For an example see the Sample DW 4.2A found on the KM
    AssetWeb database.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The document should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Introductory material<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        List of observations...problems or challenges (those reflecting major themes from the workshop) are individually
        linked to KM business issues
    </li>
    <li>
        Recommendations...best opportunities to pursue (with argument for the business value of each)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Appendix is actual workshop output
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Also, consider that the summary document be discussed on conference call with workshop participants to identify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How would they go forward?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What problems do they foresee?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider the proper scope of the pilot work or research visit (s) - where do we start?
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 12 – Get Feedback on Summary Document
</h4>
<p>
    After preparing summary document, either meet with participants or conduct a conference call to discuss.&nbsp; This
    both validates findings and perspectives and continues to foster participant involvement and buy-in.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Step 13 – Develop Report or Discussion Document
</h4>
<p>
    In most cases, this document is a validated, finalized version of the Summary Document.&nbsp; It now takes the
    participant feedback into account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    There may be cases where the client will not want to proceed beyond this step (e.g., due to budgetary
    constraints).&nbsp; It is therefore important to be sure that the document and the discussion around it delivers value
    in and of itself.
</p>
<p>
    Some key issues include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Report is generated and sponsor is engaged in a discussion on next steps.&nbsp; See the Sample DW 4.4A located on
        the KM AssetWeb database.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Input from participant discussion is used to validate hypotheses and draft report to sponsor<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Report in and of itself should deliver value, whether or not client is in a position to go forward with projects 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Each opportunity is discussed separately
            </li>
            <li>
                Includes background, possible projects, business value, potential problems<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtain go-ahead to pursue a project or projects<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine whom to speak to to gather data for the development of a proposal and workplan<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Target and plan the research visit (s)
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 14 – Conduct a Research Visit with Client
</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of the Research Visit is to "dig deeper" to identify the specific area for a pilot project and learn enough
    about it to develop a proposal for our assistance.&nbsp; Depending upon the circumstances, the Research Visit should
    take 1-2 days to conduct.&nbsp; Generally, the Research Visit includes interviews, observation and discussion.&nbsp;
    Reach consensus on how to proceed with the client.&nbsp;<br />
    This is to conduct further research within the targeted areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Develop project outlines for each area (See Sample DW 4.5A in the KM AssetWeb)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify business issue<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Assess business value<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Rate projects on multiple dimensions (pragmatic)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate rankings<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop a proposal letter to the executive whose purview the project falls under...cc.&nbsp; To whomever it makes
        sense to copy&nbsp; (See Sample 4.5 B)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Follow-up calls
    </li>
