    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    Requirements definition is to define the ultimate purpose of the new system, in other words, to make clear ‘what’ the
    new system should do.
</p>
<p>
    Defining requirements is a crucial, however, challenging and not easy work because of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Difficulties in realizing a conception into tangible software/system product
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    One of the factors is that what the user really wants the system to do may not be communicated properly to the
    requirements analyst. Users are not always aware of needs or problems of the target application. Users’ senses of
    crisis are generally vague and abstract. Those obscure requests toward a new system are transmitted to the analyst
    without being enough analyzed or organized by users. On the other hand, requirements analysts do not usually know the
    user’s environment and application details. Those differences of the both parties’ standpoint cause misunderstandings
    of requirements.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Necessity of reconciling clashes of project stakeholders’ requirements
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Very often different stakeholders have unconsciously adapted different assumptions about what they need and want. These
    different interests and requirements are bound to conflict. For example:

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>During survey, analysis of application (organization/human activity) should be prioritized, because the user’s
objectives are not to develop system or software but to improve efficiency and quality of the application that they use. To
proceed an interview smoothly, it is necessary to fully understand the user’s application prior to the survey. <br />
<br />
<p>
    <b>How should survey be prepared?</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Fully understand the target application
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If developers are not familiar with the target application, study it by modeling the current application system. DFD
    application models are useful in this process. (This paper describes survey technique applying DFD application models).
    It is essential to be able to comprehend general terms about the application including ones unique to that environment.
    Developing a glossary is effective.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Break down the system objectives
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Work with user representatives to break down the system objectives sufficiently to understand the specific requirements
    for a new system. Specific requirements are also documented with data requirements. If problems are found in developing
    models of the current system, document them as a part of those models. The identified problems are another source of
    information to understand the specific requirements for a new system. Use topdown and bottom-up approaches as follows:
</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>Break down the system objectives as finely as possible, and define the functions necessary for implementing them.
Break the functions down to the point where a specific image of the new system can be obtained. Summarize the results in
the functional breakdown of system objectives*1), estimate the level and scope of the system, predict effects, and
determine the focused areas to be surveyed.

    <strong>Who should be surveyed?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Interviewing the wrong people is one of the most common mistakes in survey. It is possible to miss the opportunity of
    talking to the unknown user who really does know what the requirements are. Choose the right people from the right
    department for survey. Usually, users can be categorized into three types: operational users, supervisory users, and
    executive users. Each type of users has the following characteristics:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Operational users</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Operational users are the operational and administrative people most likely to have the most day-to-day contact with
    the new system. They are very much concerned with the functions that the system will perform, especially human
    interface issues, which are the crucial to the success of the system. At the same time, they tend to have a “local”
    view of the system; they tend to be knowledgeable about the specific job that they do, but they often are unfamiliar
    with the “global view”. Abstract discussions about “functions” and “data elements” may be difficult for operational
    users; hence, it is necessary to talk with the user exclusively in familiar terms.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Supervisory users</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Supervisory users usually manage a group of operational users and are responsible for their performance. They are
    generally familiar with the work done by their operational subordinates and sympathize with their needs, concerns and
    perspectives. Supervisory users are often driven by budget considerations, hence they are most interested in, for
    example, whether a new system will increase the volume of work done and reduce the cost of processing transactions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Executive users</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Executive users are generally two or three levels above the action associated with the project and are more likely to
    serve as the funding authority for project requests that originate at lower levels in the organization. They are
    typically more concerned with strategic issues and long-term profit/loss. Hence, they are typically less concerned with
    operational issues.<br />
    Keep in mind that these three types of users have different perspectives, different interests and priorities, and often
    different backgrounds. Taking their characteristics into account, select appropriate people for each survey.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Requirements Survey Process</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here describes the steps for conducting a requirements survey.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify Requirements Survey Items
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Identify survey areas by analyzing application process refinement and system objectives until tangible needs for the
    new system are fully understood.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Classify and organize breakdown objectives and record them in the survey item list.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Utilize DFD-application model effectively during the examination (rough sketch is sufficient at first).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    2. &nbsp;Plan Requirements Survey
</p>
<p>
    Determine survey methods, survey areas, and survey schedule for a smooth survey, and develop a survey plan. Based on
    the survey plan, organize a survey team.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Determine survey methods and prepare survey guides. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Questionnaire
            </li>
            <li>
                Interview by department/individual
            </li>
            <li>
                User workshops, brainstorming sessions, etc.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Organize a survey item list and develop a survey sheet.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare for prototyping, if necessary.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Select survey departments and areas and organize a survey team.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make a survey schedule.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the survey plan reviewed together with users and communicate the results to the participants.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    3.&nbsp;Survey User Requirements
</p>
<p>
    Conduct a survey according to the survey plan and collect needs for the new system at the data element level.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Conduct a survey according to the survey plan and collect needs for the new system at the data element level.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Needs for the new system includes functions and priority to be added or improved and information (data elements) to be
    newly required or improved and weighting*2), needs for system resources, number of data generated, generation frequency
    and expected growth, trigger for process, etc.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Utilize current DFD physical model/DFD current logical model (being developed) for the survey.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When prototyping is selected for extracting needs or checking the user interface requirements, prioritize required
        functions and data elements to be displayed in this process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img height="426" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/weighting_data_elements_example.JPG" width="632" />
</p>
<p>
    4.&nbsp;Fill Out System Needs Analysis Form
</p>
<p>
    Describe new functions and processes to be improved and data on the "System Needs Analysis Form" using DFD-application
    model, and record the priority of each of the needs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Describe new functions or processes to be improved using the DFD-application model and enter the necessary data
        elements.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        As for physical requirements such as process methods and restrictions, frequency and number of data generated
        should be entered in addition to the process method requirements. Special conditions or restrictions to start
        (trigger) or to choose the process, if any, should also be entered.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter priority/weighting for each required function and data element.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make an additional survey when ambiguity or unclear points appear during the organization/description process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    5.&nbsp;Perform System Requirements Analysis
</p>
<p>
    Collect system needs, while confirming that each of the needs is in accordance with the desired system objectives and
    application scope. The results, including priority, should be confirmed with user departments/related departments.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Relate each of the needs to the DFD current physical model/DFD current logical model and confirm that there is no
        deviation from the desired system objectives and application scope.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Consolidate the survey results according to a functional breakdown of system objectives and organize the system
        needs.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtain agreement from surveyed and related departments for the system needs and their priority.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Key considerations in interviewing</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        More than two persons should participate in the interview to ensure that all comments are heard and notes are taken
        properly.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The interview results should be itemized and entered in the survey sheet and should not be processed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Feed back the interview results to survey members on the same day so as to prevent duplication of questions.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It is preferable that interviewers use blank copy of the "System Needs Analysis Form" for taking notes so as to ask
        all the necessary questions.
    </li>
</ul>

        JRP is a workshop held with selected end users during requirements planning phase for the purpose of bring out
        requirements from user departments. JRP is intended to determine requirements in contrast with JAD, which is
        intended to design systems while developing prototypes. An expert called ‘workshop leader’ proceeds a meeting with
        strong leadership in charge of drawing user needs and organizing the results structurally. From user departments,
        members with the decisive power, including an ‘executive owner’, must participate in the workshop.

        system design. Its characteristics are that users are involved deeply in the implementation process and that
        prototyping is iterated several times until requirements and specifications, or basis of the entire system are
        determined.

                To decrease misunderstandings and mistakes of requirements specifications caused by communication gaps as
                users participate in a project from the initial stage.
            </li>
            <li>
                To define the details from the early stage which users themselves did not notice by actually running the
                prototypes.
            </li>
            <li>
                To confirm user acceptance from the early period.
            </li>
            <li>
                To find problems and errors in the early period and reduce defect removal cost during implementation and
                maintenance cost.
            </li>
            <li>
                To cut down documentation cost by using prototypes as specifications.
            </li>
            <li>
                To estimate implementation cost early and accurately as specifications are defined in the early stage.
            </li>
            <li>
                To reduce overall implementation period considerably.&nbsp;
