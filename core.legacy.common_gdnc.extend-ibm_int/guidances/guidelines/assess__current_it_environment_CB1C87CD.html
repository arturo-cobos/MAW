    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    To assess the current IT environment, including installed applications, data, infrastructure and key standards. To
    assess the effectiveness, efficiency, cost structure and competence of the IS/IT organization and its management.
</p>The gathering of information suitable for an assessment of the current IT environment, is part of a much wider
information gathering activity, which occurs in the early stages of any client engagement. Information gathering should be
looked at, resourced and conducted as a single activity, with the various 'threads' of information being routed through to
specific work products, as appropriate e.g. Current IT Environment, Current IT Assessment, etc. 
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    This technique paper covers those activities, which are specific to the Current IT Assessment work product, on the
    assumption that the relevant information needed for the assessment is already available.
</p>Assessments of this type can be conducted in several types of engagement: 
<ul>
    <li>
        as part of an IT Strategy level engagement - when it is normally the only assessment of IT that is undertaken - the
        Current IT Assessment work product and associated technique paper provides the prime guidance
    </li>
    <li>
        during the early stages of an enterprise-wide architecture, or e-Strategic Architecture(e-SA) level engagement, to
        gain an insight into the overall age, usage and gaps in the applications, data and infrastructure as an input to
        defining the requirements which are captured in the Technology Model WP. In an e-SA led engagement, the main
        assessment of the current application portfolio, data bases and infrastructure will occur <b>after</b> the
        Technology Model has been defined, when the objective is to understand the match between the current IT environment
        and the newly defined e-SA - in this instance, the IT Architecture Compliance Assessment work product is used.
    </li>
    <li>
        The outputs from all levels are used to highlight transition initiatives.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Work in workshop mode, using a core team of business users, IT management (including application development project
    managers) and senior IT professionals - people who understand the business requirements and priorities, the current
    IS/IT environment and the existing project portfolio. Make sure that all the relevant inputs needed for the Current IT
    Assessment are collected at the same time as the inputs for Current IT Environment work product.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Organize and brief the team of assessors
</h4>
<p>
    Choose the assessment team. The composition of this team is key - use a combination of assessors to include people who
    are familiar with the various outputs of the Current IT Environment and the information gathering activities (which are
    key inputs to these assessment activities), are business representatives and project managers.
</p>
<p>
    Choose people who have a sound background in the issues which are likely to be raised during the assessments. All
    assessors should have credibility within the organization to perform this work, so avoid being obliged to take "whoever
    is free". The value of the conclusions will be affected by who has done the work as much as the process followed.
</p>
<p>
    As it is inevitable that some parts of current environment will score badly, (and possibly upset the owners or
    developers), then the team must have the experience and credibility necessary to justify any "politically difficult"
    messages to management.<br />
    Where possible, include business users and developers in these assessment activities.
</p>
<p>
    Inevitably the depth of understanding that individual team members have for each of the criteria will vary. A "round
    table" discussion about each criteria is essential, at the workshop, to level set what is involved.
</p>
<p>
    Pairs of assessors should be chosen to balance skills, background, and experience.
</p>
<p>
    Produce a package of briefing materials for the assessors and distribute beforehand. Customize the sample briefing
    package attached above. The content should cover:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Basics: date/time/place/duration etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Context & Purpose of assessment activities (why this activity is needed and where it fits in the overall
        engagement)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessment Objectives and scope<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Approach/Expected level of participation (how will it actually work, what will be expected of the
        participants)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Initial workshop agenda - the objective is to bring together all the people involved in the assessment and agree a
        number of key points: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                the areas to be assessed (application system, technical infrastructure, IT policies, plans, organization,
                skills and management practices)
            </li>
            <li>
                the criteria to be used
            </li>
            <li>
                how the assessments will be organized
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The composition of the list of systems/environments to be assessed, should be the responsibility of a wider group than
    just the assessment team. It will require discussions with senior managers (and possibly the sponsor), and functional
    heads within IT and the business. Before the workshop, a 'straw man' list should have been developed - this is then
    discussed, amended if necessary, and agreed.
</p>
<p>
    Whichever combination of information gathering is chosen (interviews, workshops or surveys/questionnaires), any
    interviewees/project owners, will need to be fully briefed on the assessment process and criteria, ideally before the
    interview/workshop/survey. Consider the advance circulation of an "information pack" with background information,
    architecture descriptions, principles, requirements, and other supporting materials.
</p>
<h4>
    Agree which elements of the current environment are to be assessed
</h4>
<p>
    Use the outputs from the Current IT Environment and the information gathering activities to agree the areas/systems to
    be assessed.<br />
    Remember that most of the business process and information needs of an organization will currently be supported, to a
    greater or lesser extent, by the existing legacy application portfolio (and its inherent infrastructure).
</p>
<p>
    This list could cover:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        all major current applications and infrastructure that are likely to be significant in the future<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        all major current infrastructure that is likely to be significant in the future&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        planned replacement systems (future project portfolio) - infrastructure and systems that are due for replacement
        within, say 18 months. The assessment of these systems may occur as part of a definition/revision exercise for the
        future Strategic Project Portfolio.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        new projects which may be under development, or in plan to be implemented within the next 3 years<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        current IT organization, skills, management and sourcing practices and plans
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Define the assessment criteria
</h4>
<p>
    Using the input materials (samples and templates are attached in the EA Method database, IBM IT Comparison Intellectual
    Capital and Current IT Environment), agree the assessment criteria, conformance ratings, scoring system and
    documentation standards.
</p>
<p>
    The assessment criteria could include the following, depending on the time available and level of assessment required -
    remember, that if this assessment is being done as part of an overall e-SA engagement, a major assessment activity
    (using the IT Architecture Compliance Assessment work product) will occur after the e-SA Model has been defined - you
    will need to make a judgment on the scope and level of assessment completed at this early stage - enough to provide
    perceived business benefit to your client, but not too much for him to get concerned about duplicated effort!:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Functional quality - the extent to which the applications support the critical business functions and the quality
        of that support, data quality, (i.e. currency, redundancy, accuracy)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical quality - technical efficiency of existing application systems e.g. their age, stability, reliability,
        maintainability and the longer term technical potential;, technical efficiency of the current infrastructure e.g.
        stability, reliability, maintainability, age of installed base,&nbsp; support for critical business functions e.g.
        availability, performance, anticipated business growth and the longer term technical potential<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for defined Distinctive Business and IT Capabilities<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Conformance to any guiding principles which have been defined<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for the Business Activity Model (could be defined using the Future Process Definition WP) - if it exists
        and to whatever level it has been defined (at the IT Strategy level it may exist as an Arena Process Model)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for the Business Information Model - if it exists and to whatever level it has been defined<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for the IT vision - captured in the Architecture Vision WP<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Support for IT Governance directions (at the IT Strategy level, this will be output from IT Governance activities
        covering - IT
    </li>
    <li>
        Processes (based on ITPM), IT Organization and Sourcing work products)
    </li>
    <li>
        Overall effectiveness of the IT/IS department in its support of the business - includes user satisfaction with IT
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The agreed assessment criteria should be weighted in terms of importance to the business, and an assessment matrix
    developed (see attached sample above). As an example weightings could be assigned on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = not
    applicable and 5 = very important. Note: The use of weightings for the assessment scores is optional. It may not be
    necessary (or desirable) to total the scores for a particular assessment, which renders the weights irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
    Agree documentation standards - the results of these assessments are best captured in spreadsheets (or similar). A
    standard template (with the criteria and scoring system) can be constructed (see attached example above). This eases
    transfer to summary/conclusion documents, graphs and any arithmetic work required. Also, spreadsheets can be loaded
    onto laptops for direct data entry during interviews and workshops.
</p>
<h4>
    Conduct the assessments
</h4>
<p>
    Assessments can be conducted in one of two ways - decide which is appropriate, based on scope, time available and
    assessment objectives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        based on returned surveys/questionnaires - in this instance, consider the following: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                As the survey forms are returned, check them for completeness. Briefly scan each form to check for
                discrepancies and omissions. Ensure there have been no major misunderstandings with respect to the
                questions. If there are any issues, schedule individual meetings to confirm their responses. .<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        in workshop mode: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                each chosen project will be assessed for conformance and an assessment matrix completed - use teams of two
                assessors
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;any conformance issues will be documented within the matrix, with comments to clarify the ratings
                given.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ensuring the consistency of scoring when multiple assessment teams are used is difficult. Teams should be strongly
    encouraged to document any reasons for their score, particularly for high or low scores.
</p>
<p>
    If you are concerned about consistency, ensure the assessments are reviewed by a peer reviewer
</p>
<p>
    For each application/technical area assessed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Summarize and plot the responses. We are aiming to create an overall picture of the applications effectiveness and
        contribution to the business. Where there are opposing views of an application, investigative to determine
        reasons.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Plot the functional quality versus technical quality (FQ/TQ Matrix) - a detailed plot of the various attributes of
        the functional and technical quality can assist in determining specific weakness areas<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate the general positioning of the applications on the FQ/TQ matrix - by varying the size of the circle or dot
        for each application, further, more powerful, insights can be achieved. Differing sizes can be plotted for
        application size, investment in application and application age.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop an assessment for each application taking all the information into consideration<br />
        In addition to assessing each individual application, develop an assessment of the portfolio as a whole. Tie
        together information on several characteristics, such as the age profile, the conflicting views of users and IS,
        the investment versus rating, etc.&nbsp;<br />
        Where practical, compare the client’s portfolio with other competitors or with industry averages or norms.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each non-technical area of the IT environment to be assessed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        review against IBM IT Comparison IC and other external industry material as appropriate<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        capture the responses in matrix form, for graphical presentation as appropriate
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Moderate the results
</h4>
<p>
    When all assessments are complete, compare and discuss the results as a team, highlighting any major observations or
    issues which have become apparent.
</p>
<p>
    It is useful to combine all the application assessment results into a single spreadsheet for manipulation (see samples
    attached to the Architecture Compliance Assessment technique paper referenced above).
</p>
<p>
    The results can be very powerfully presented in the form of comparative graphs, showing functional vs. technical
    ratings - see samples attached above.
</p>
<h4>
    Document gaps and additional support requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Using the Capability Model WP previously defined, plus the outputs from the assessments, highlight any major areas
    where current support is low, or there is application/infrastructure/product confusion. Areas where the business value
    is high and the existing coverage is poor, provide the opportunity to maximize the benefits of IT investment, and
    therefore should be a major focus.<br />
    Focus also, on the assessments of those applications with a high business value - this provides a measure of the degree
    to which the current applications support the business.
</p>
<p>
    Identify any serious problems, current or potential, and optionally make recommendations as to how these may be
    addressed.<br />
    Document any important gaps, support characteristics, transition issues and requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Identify any potential short term projects that can provide rapid business benefits.
</p>
<p>
    Capture these findings as an input to your conclusions - they will also be a major input to the Transition Initiatives
    work product, and the associated Transition Strategy and Planning activities.
</p>
<p>
    Review the assessment results with the client sponsor and get agreement.
</p>
<h4>
    Communicate the results and conclusions from the assessment
</h4>
<p>
    All assessment findings should be documented in a form suitable for presentation to senior management and other
    interested parties (see attached sample above). The political impact of the conclusions must be treated sensitively.
    The results may be seen by some as an "attack" or "slur", notably where some applications or parts of the
    infrastructure have scored poorly. The briefing materials must stress these points, as must the conclusions.
