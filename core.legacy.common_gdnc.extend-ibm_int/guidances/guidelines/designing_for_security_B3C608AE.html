    1&nbsp;Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Security must be an integral part of any IBM engagement. In this era of increasing attacks on corporate networks and
    the emphasis on trust our customers expect IBM to develop sites that will meet their security and privacy needs.
    Failure to do so can result in losses to the client and to IBM. Poor security in delivered systems can negatively
    impact the client’s and IBM’s public image, cause embarrassment, loss of revenue/business, loss of customers, and/or
    result in legal implications.
</p>This Security technique paper describes, to engagement managers, the approach to be used to ensure that: 
<ol>
    <li>
        IT related security risks that the client will face upon deployment of the IT solution under design are documented
        properly.
    </li>
    <li>
        The client has an opportunity to select a set of recommendations documented by IBM IT security professionals that
        will guide the design, integration and operation of the solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        The client will sign-off as to his/her understanding of the risks associated with deploying and managing the
        solution under design, given the operating environment, the security threats, the cost of implementation, impact on
        quality of service, the deployed countermeasures and the residual risks.
    </li>
</ol>Security is a critical consideration in every Information Technology consulting, design and integration engagement
conducted by IBM Global Services personnel. Failure to adequately factor the risks and consequences of security threats,
especially in e-business solutions, can result in losses to the client and can negatively impact IBM’s public image, cause
embarrassment, loss of revenue/business, loss of customers, and/or result in legal implications to IBM.

</table>Security should be addressed during the initial phases of IT solution design whenever possible. Adding security
components and countermeasures after a design is finalized is not a sound approach because of the expense involved, and
because point application of security is less effective than is integrated security. 
<p>
    Security must be designed into the application from the beginning. Attempts to add it after a design is finalized, or
    worse yet, implemented, are extremely expensive, ineffective or both. Decisions about the amount of acceptable risk in
    the final implementation are business decisions that should be made by the client with appropriate inputs on the
    potential results provided by the IBM team. Designing effective security strategies involves complex decisions based on
    hundreds of technical and process oriented choices. A security professional should be contacted and included in every
    engagement - there are over 600 worldwide.
</p>
<p>
    The objective of this technique is to ensure that a design satisfies security requirements.&nbsp; The technique is used
    throughout the solution design, development, and deployment stages.&nbsp; It describes the methods to be employed,
    issues to be considered, and how to approach the design and validation of security characteristics.&nbsp; It is
    applicable to all systems.
</p>
<p>
    The graphic below provides an overview of the methodology used by IBM Global Services personnel who have been trained
    in IT Security analysis and design.

</p>
<p>
    As the design evolves throughout a project, it is common for different parts of it to be at different levels of
    abstraction (and detail), and the technique should be applied flexibly to reflect this.
</p>
<p>
    As part of using this technique, overall security requirements for the system will be captured in the business
    requirements.&nbsp; It is important to identify the business drivers of the security and privacy implemented in the
    final solution plus the security architectural principles. This provides a way of documenting the risk acceptance
    decisions of the business managers.
</p>
<p>
    The sequencing of security analysis and design in relation to other work on the solution varies according to project
    circumstances.&nbsp; There are often tradeoffs with other objectives and requirements; for example, delivering high
    security may compromise a need for high performance.&nbsp; The final decisions for these tradeoffs need to lie with the
    client with appropriate support from the IBM team.
</p>
<p>
    The activities and tasks performed in support of this technique require the extensive use of intellectual capital only
    available to IBM trained security consultants and architects.&nbsp; It is important that these individuals be included
    in the project from its inception.
</p>
<p>
    This technique is based on IBM’s proprietary Method for Architecting Secure Solutions (MASS).&nbsp; MASS is firmly
    based on ISO-15408 Common Criteria, an internationally recognized standard for security assessment and design.

    &lt;REPLACE THIS TEXT with specific information that explains the conditions or situations that it applies to.&gt;
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Project Definition - assist with security assurance elements
</h4>
<p>
    The Security Architect or Consultant will identify the security portions of the engagement model and provide the
    template for inclusion into the overall project work breakdown structure.&nbsp; They will also work with the business
    consultants to identify any statutory requirements for security and privacy in the application.
</p>
<h4>
    A. Requirements gathering –
</h4>
<p>
    The security and privacy to be incorporated within the application must be based on firm business requirements of the
    client.&nbsp; The Security Consultant will assist the Business Consultants in identifying these requirements.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <h5>
        1.&nbsp;Business & IT context & environment, security policy, etc.
    </h5>
    <p>
        There are many items that will impact the security and privacy decisions.&nbsp; Among these are the business
        context of the application, the IT environment of the client and the proposed end-users, the security architectural
        principles and existing corporate security policies.&nbsp; A balance between the risk, cost and quality of service
        needs to be considered. This information will be collected and organized following the British Standard 7799, also
        called the Code of Practice for Information Security Management.
    </p>
    <h5>
        2.&nbsp;Actors, roles, business processes, use cases –
    </h5>
    <p>
        Identifying the various actors, their roles, how they interact with the business process and developing use cases
        for them is the next iteration of capturing the requirements.&nbsp; The Security Consultant will identify where
        security implications exist with the normal flow as well as identify the need for the security specific actors,
        processes, and use cases.
    </p>
    <h5>
        3.&nbsp;Assets & their owners
    </h5>
    <p>
        The business assets and their owners must be identified, and the asset valued in accordance with the impact of its
        exposure, modification, or loss.&nbsp; This is a critically important process, as its results will be used to
        support almost all further security decisions.
    </p>
    <h5>
        4.&nbsp;Risk Management – Initial countermeasures
    </h5>
    <p>
        An initial concept of the appropriate countermeasures is suggested very early on in the engagement.&nbsp; This
        concept is normally based on apriori knowledge of the type of application being developed, the client’s industry,
        and work performed on similar sites.&nbsp; This basic concept is then validated/modified during the requirements
        gathering stages.&nbsp; The risk counter measures, their associated costs are validated against the related impact
        of the desire quality of service. The basis of a Risk Assessment is depicted in Figure 2.<br />

<h4>
    B. Derive Security Design Objectives from requirements
</h4>
<p>
    After the initial requirements have been gathered they are distilled into the seven security design objectives defined
    in MASS.&nbsp; These objectives can be summarized as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Deploy and manage trusted credentials and Identification and Authentication protocols<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Control access to stored information consistent with roles, responsibilities and privacy policies<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Control access to, and use of, systems and processes consistent with roles and responsibilities<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Protect information stored, or in transit, consistent with information classification, control and flow
        policies<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Assure the correct and reliable operation of components & services<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Defend against attacks<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Defend against fraud
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These objectives are then validated with the client.
</p>
<h4>
    C. Derive Security Domains, put onto Architecture Overview diagram
</h4>
<p>
    Security Domains are used to layer protections and to separate the business assets and functions into domains
    appropriate to the protections required.&nbsp; There are five defined domains in the basic MASS architecture model;
    Uncontrolled, Controlled, Restricted, Secured, and External Controlled. The conduit between the Security Domains can
    also be defined, Trusted, Untrusted and Controlled. The identification of these domains, their definitions, and the
    controls required to transit the boundaries is another key security function.
</p>
<h4>
    D. Derive Security Subsystems, map requirements to them & place in Security Domains
</h4>
<p>
    MASS defines five security subsystems; Access Control, Information Flow Control, Audit, Integrity, and Trusted
    Credentials. These subsystems are now mapped to the various security domains identified in the previous step.&nbsp;
    Each subsystem may show up in more than one domain and each domain will contain more than one subsystem.
</p>
<h4>
    E. Derive component Models of Security Subsystems (i.e. create component architecture for each subsystem)
</h4>
<p>
    Each of the defined security subsystems is composed of a number of predefined components.&nbsp; These components are
    conceptual in nature and do not map directly to security products.&nbsp; They express a business requirement for a set
    of functionality at a specific location in the design.&nbsp; They identify capabilities to support both normal and
    anomalous activities. These components are used to incorporate security into the overall design of the application at
    the component architecture level to support the business requirements and processes.
</p>
<p>
    This level of the design should be articulated with a diagram with enough textual description that explains the
    following features of the design:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Pre-existing environment<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Policy / Threat / Compliance assumptions and requirements<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Network Information Systems Infrastructure for all domains<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Credential System requirements by domain by network device and end user systems<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Flow control Requirements by domain and between domains<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Domain boundary control<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Domain flow control<br />
        Security Audit and Solution Integrity functions as required by policy and compliance directive, or as security
        countermeasures
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    F: Derive the use cases for the security operations of the application/network
</h4>
<p>
    The required security use cases will vary based on the needs of the application.&nbsp; At a minimum they should
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Registering users<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Authenticating users<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Validating access to critical processes and information assets<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Audit of critical processes
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    G. Derive operational Models of Security Subsystems (i.e. create operational architecture for each subsystem)
</h4>
<p>
    The operational model includes the initial look at potential physical implementations of the various components.&nbsp;
    At this point the security components will be instantiated in the various products selected.&nbsp; Tradeoffs between
    performance, quality of service and security will be made.&nbsp; These tradeoffs must be identified, assessed against
    the security requirements and appropriate countermeasures developed. The operational procedures are defined based on
    product selection, policies and operational processes. Input is provided into infrastructure and networking designs.
</p>
<h4>
    H. Revise Risk Assessment based on anomalous flow, derive countermeasures and design countermeasures into component
    model / operational model
</h4>
<p>
    After the initial iteration of the design the Security Consultant and Architect will validate it from an anomalous flow
    view.&nbsp; This is the “What happens if” analysis of the design.&nbsp; How is the design affected by out of bounds
    inputs, by individuals or processes entering or executing out of sequence, by attacks against the underlying
    infrastructure, etc.&nbsp; Any potential vulnerabilities are assessed for their impact to the business assets, then the
    countermeasures incorporated in the design are reviewed where appropriate.&nbsp; These are all risk-based decisions
    that should be approved by the client with appropriate support from the IBM development team.
</p>
<h4>
    I. Review & iterate
</h4>
<p>
    This technique is utilized at each of the steps in the application design and development.&nbsp; At each step the
    process gets more detailed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Document all of the decisions made.&nbsp; Cross-reference them against the business requirements and the risk model
    developed during the early phases.&nbsp; Be sure to get the client to approve all of the decisions made that impact the
    security of the application and the business assets.
</p>
<h4>
    Ongoing: Assurance Tasks
</h4>
<p>
    As the design is being worked the system test plan is also being developed.&nbsp; The Security Consultant provides
    inputs into this plan in the areas of testing the security specific portions of the design and in testing the security
    of the other portions of the design.&nbsp; These tests provide the requisite assurance that the final implementation
    meets the client’s stated security and privacy needs.&nbsp; It is the final tie of the completed work back to the
    original requirements.&nbsp; The test team augmented by security specialist will perform the security testing.&nbsp;
    IBM Ethical Hackers from the Security & Privacy Services group should perform a final penetration test of the
    pre-production system. The security architecture is augmented to the Enterprise Architecture to maintain its vitality
    and integrated into infrastructure, networking and application changes.
