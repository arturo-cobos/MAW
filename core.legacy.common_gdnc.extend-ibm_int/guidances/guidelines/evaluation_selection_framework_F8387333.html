    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    The Evaluation and Selection Framework Technique Paper, shows how to define a single set of selection criteria,
    processes and defined roles and responsibilities, for the evaluation and selection of components and packages, as part
    of the Decision Model Work Product. Many organizations have multiple processes and define individual evaluation and
    selection criteria as required, often at the solution design or package selection stage. However, having a single,
    enterprise-level framework, built around previously defined principles that underpin the business goals and objectives,
    eliminates duplication of effort, allows rational, objective criteria to be defined and provides for more consistent
    decision making over time.
</p>
<p>
    The technique provides a framework within which design and acquisition decisions can be effectively made and
    communicated. Once this evaluation and selection framework has been defined, the Decision Model WP can then be used to
    make decisions regarding the fit of a specific product to a specific business need (for example, using the CAD
    Infrastructure Product Selection technique paper, or the PSI Product Selection capability pattern). It can also be used
    for the selection of a potential standard, or even a less structured decision for which criteria might need to be
    developed.
</p>
<p>
    Evaluation and selection activities can and do occur at many levels within an organization. At solution design time,
    this enterprise-level framework is used in many ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To guide the documentation of component requirements, alternative solutions and the rationale for making a
        particular selection. For example in the ‘Evaluate Infrastructure Products’ task of the Custom Application
        Development (CAD) Engagement Model<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        As a basis for eliminating the majority of candidate solutions with documented cause. For example in the ‘Select
        Infrastructure Products’ task of the Custom Application Development (CAD) Engagement Model<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        As the basis, for making a final decision on the best alternative option to select. Also in the ‘Select
        Infrastructure Products’ task of the Custom Application Development (CAD) Engagement Model.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    Within the IGS Method, there are several work products that provide inputs to these evaluation and selection activities
    and others that do detailed component selection. The purpose of this technique is not to replace or duplicate these
    work products, but to define the overall framework within which these detailed component evaluation and selection
    activities can occur.
</p>
<p>
    The overall objective is to allow architectural components, standards, products, and services to be evaluated and
    selected based on rational, objective criteria, which reflect the overall business needs, rather than the requirements
    of a single solution. This increases the chances of identifying shared functions and the same solution being chosen for
    similar functional requirements by different decision makers.
</p>
<p>
    The diagram below shows the key relationships between some of the work products involved and the typical execution of a
    CAD, Security, Network or other design level project, where detailed product and component selection occurs. Each
    relationship is numbered and the description of these is included, to help clarify and position where and how this
    technique is used.

    <strong>Principles, Policies & Guidelines:</strong> Principles provide the underlying rules for making design and
    component/product select decisions. They must also be tied directly back to the business capabilities and be seen to
    help implement the business strategy. Principles are a key input to the Decision Model WP (1) and the Architectural
    Decisions WP (4). The Principles, Policies and Guidelines are also a key input to the Enterprise Technology Framework,
    where they will help to drive the shape and feel of the architectures overall and influence the components and
    reference architectures it includes (2). Principles will also underpin how the enterprise-level architectures are
    managed (5)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Decision Model:</strong> Defines the overall processes, roles and responsibilities (at an enterprise level) for
    how components, products, packages and suppliers will be selected. Defines generic evaluation and selection criteria.
    Provides the rules for <strong>how</strong> products and components will be selected at a project level. It is this
    Evaluation and Selection Framework TP that focuses on defining these component parts of the Decision Model. The
    Decision Model provides a key input to all Solution level projects where component and design decisions need to be made
    (7). It is also integrated with the Architecture Management Framework, which ensures that the processes, roles and
    responsibilities defined in the Decision Model are adhered to (6).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Enterprise Technology Framework:</strong> Defines the overall framework of technology components required by an
    enterprise. Documents all the functional and non-functional requirements of each technology/infrastructure component.
    Documents the various implementations of each technology component allowed in the enterprise. Documents selected
    products and standard components. All component parts of each chosen reference model (e.g. ESS templates, Patterns for
    e-business) will exist in the Enterprise Technology Framework (ETF) - so each reference architecture and it's chosen
    implementations will be a subset of /instance of the ETF. For example, the Component Model (WP) for a Customer Service
    System will be a subset/instance of how various components defined in the ETF will be implemented, to support Customer
    Service. The Enterprise Technology Framework will implement the Principles (2) and the contents will evolve and be
    managed over time by the Architecture Management Framework (11).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Architecture Management Framework:</strong> Defines the processes, roles and responsibilities for managing an
    enterprise-level architecture over time, as new systems and solutions are developed and implemented. Defines the rules
    and guidelines for when new products and components can be selected.<br />
    It:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        ensures development projects conform to the principles and use chosen/standard components and products (conformance
        process)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        defines when and how non-conformance is allowed (non-conformance process)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        allows the enterprise-level architecture to be updated and changed over time, as business and IT requirements and
        capabilities change (vitality and change processes)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        provides a framework for communicating changes (communications process)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Management decisions are captured in the Architectural Decisions WP (12).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Architectural Decisions:</strong> Document all decisions taken during a development or architecture-based
    project, including (but not limited to) product selection decisions, component design decisions,
    conformance/non-conformance decisions, with reasons why, plus appropriate management signoffs.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Individual Projects (CAD, Security, N/W, SM, etc.):</strong> implement a subset of the desired function
    required by the business.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        will use chosen, pre-selected standards, products, packages, reference architectures etc. where they exist. Project
        teams will reference several work product outputs, including the Enterprise Technology Framework to understand what
        these are (8)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        where no standard/pre-selection exists, or what exists is not appropriate for requirements, they will evaluate and
        select specific products, packages or components, using given guidelines/prescribed processes, etc., to provide the
        desired function. The process for agreeing selections which don’t conform to the enterprise-level architectures,
        are defined in the Architecture Management Framework (9). The Decision Model will provide the evaluation and
        selection process and criteria (7) and the component and design decisions made will be captured in the
        Architectural Decisions WP (10).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As new design and component decisions are made and new standards, etc. are agreed, the Enterprise Technology Framework
    will be updated (8).
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    This technique has four main steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understand existing evaluation and selection framework<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Define evaluation criteria<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Develop documentation guidelines
            </li>
            <li>
                Select appropriate sample criteria and categories
            </li>
            <li>
                Define evaluation criteria categories
            </li>
            <li>
                Define global evaluation criteria<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Define evaluation process 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Prepare 'strawman' evaluation process
            </li>
            <li>
                Define scoring technique<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Document and agree evaluation and selection framework
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 1 – Understand existing evaluation and selection framework
</h4>
<p>
    Using the team's understanding of the current IT environment and processes, document the existing processes, roles and
    responsibilities involved in product, component and package evaluation and selection.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This step is often most sensibly done in a workshop environment with all the key stakeholders. Using the samples
        attached to this TP as a starting point, work through the key roles and responsibilities in the IT/IS department
        relating to the evaluation and selection of components, products, suppliers, packages etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Note that the IT Process Model also provides an excellent framework for these tasks. Often you will find that
        multiple people believe they have responsibility for the same area, whilst for others the ownership and acceptance
        of responsibility may be sadly lacking.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Working in this way highlights overlaps and issues, which will be input to the subsequent definition of transition
    initiatives to implement a common evaluation and selection framework, as part of an overall enterprise-wide decision
    model.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 -&nbsp; Define Evaluation Criteria
</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of this step is to define the general evaluation criteria and categories, which can be used for making
    decisions regarding components, standards, and products.&nbsp; These general criteria will be customized and made more
    specific, as each evaluation team prepares to make design and component selection decisions, using the process outlined
    in the following step.
</p>
<p>
    Both the evaluation process and criteria can be effectively defined as workshop activities.&nbsp; Some consultants have
    found it useful to define categories of evaluation criteria such as Business Function, Vendor, Performance Criteria and
    Architecture Compliance to provide a framework for discussing and defining the criteria.
</p>
<p>
    Working as a team, use the sample criteria or a tailored straw man, as a basis for defining the global level
    criteria.&nbsp; Note: It is very easy at this stage, to spend a lot of time refining to too low a level of detail –
    remember you’re not doing any detailed evaluation & selection yet – there are other work products, which are used
    for this more detailed level.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Develop Documentation Guidelines:</strong> In order for the evaluation criteria to be most effective they must
    be well communicated.&nbsp; You should develop a documentation template, which will work with your client.&nbsp; We
    suggest you use the sample criteria and processes attached to this TP as a starting point.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Select Appropriate Sample Criteria and Categories</strong>: Based on the types of architecture being developed,
    select appropriate categories for criteria and a starter set for each, from the samples.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider giving
    these criteria, as part of an associated discussion paper, to the project team prior to the workshop.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Define Evaluation Criteria Categories:</strong> Beginning with the selected samples or "straw man", agree on
    the evaluation criteria categories as a team.&nbsp; Remember to choose categories, which will apply across all types of
    decisions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Define Global Evaluation Criteria:</strong> Define the overall set of evaluation criteria.&nbsp; Remember that
    the individual criteria within each category may differ for each of the decision types being considered.&nbsp; For
    example, Vendor Criteria for standards selection might include the number of vendors with products conforming to the
    standard, while for a product selection decision it would be the number of products offered by a vendor which conform
    to the corporate standard.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 – Define Evaluation Process
</h4>
<p>
    Develop the process by which the evaluation criteria will be used to make business and technology decisions. This step
    defines the processes that will be used to evaluate and select architecture components as well as other business and
    technical decisions.&nbsp; This step can be accomplished either in a workshop, or a series of team meetings.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Prepare Straw Man Evaluation Process:</strong> The IBM Consultants should develop a sample or "straw man"
    process for decision-making.&nbsp; This will normally involve defining a process for customizing and agreeing weighting
    criteria, scoring alternatives and selecting an alternative.&nbsp; The client sample evaluation processes and criteria
    attached to this TP, has some useful guidance.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: In general, each specific evaluation and selection decision (at the project/design level) will
    require a review of the overall evaluation criteria and weightings, defined in the previous step.&nbsp; The values of
    these weightings and criteria will likely vary, depending on the intended usage of the component and functional
    requirements.&nbsp; For example, a server database and personal database could have significantly different
    availability, performance, integrity, security and vendor support requirements.&nbsp; This step of reviewing and
    tailoring the criteria and weights should be included in the overall evaluation process.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Define Scoring Technique:</strong> Using the "straw man" process developed above, have the team focus on the
    scoring technique.&nbsp; If a weighting scheme is part of the process, a discussion of who should set the weights and
    whether or not the evaluation team should be aware of the weights is usually worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Some would argue that the evaluation team should not set the weights, or even know what they
    are, to avoid the natural tendency to drive the answer towards a favored solution.&nbsp; This is exactly why we
    advocate defining the evaluation criteria and their overall weightings here, before they can be influenced, by the
    developing architecture models and selected reference architectures.<br />
    For example: A component decision needs to be made on Databases.&nbsp; Product support may be a key evaluation
    criteria, however the weighting could be different, dependent on whether it was for mission critical or personal
    database applications.
</p>
<p>
    Another approach to evaluating components is to classify all criteria as "essential", " important", or "nice to
    have".&nbsp; No combination of "important" criteria can be more significant than any one "essential" criterion and no
    combination of "nice to have" criteria can be more significant than any one "important" criterion.&nbsp; This scheme
    forces the evaluation team to define what is really significant to the decision.&nbsp; While this can be quite
    difficult, it will allow the team to make a decision based on essential requirements, using the important and nice to
    have items, only for tie-breakers.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4 - Document and agree Evaluation and Selection Framework
</h4>
<p>
    Document the evaluation and selection criteria and processes defined above and agree with sponsor and stakeholders.
    Once these have agreed they should become an integral part of existing processes within the IT organization.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Tools
</h3>
<p>
    •&nbsp;Use word processing tools, for example, MS Word, for textual documents defining processes, roles and
    responsibilities and evaluation and selection criteria<br />
    •&nbsp;Use VISIO (or similar) for Process flow diagrams (also used for communication)<br />
    •&nbsp;Use spreadsheets/tables during evaluation and selection activities to capture findings.
