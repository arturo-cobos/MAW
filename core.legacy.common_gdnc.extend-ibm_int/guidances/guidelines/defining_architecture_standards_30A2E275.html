    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    The objective of this technique is to ensure that a design satisfies availability, security, system management,
    performance and capacity requirements. The sequencing of application design review in relation to other work on the
    operational model varies according to project circumstances.&nbsp; There are often tradeoffs with other objectives and
    requirements; for example, delivering high availability may compromise a need for simple system management.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    At this stage of the engagement you should have gained agreement from your customer on two key points:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The complexity of the requirements does not lend itself to a simple e-business solution, and a more extensive
        design process is needed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The business scenario created and presented correctly reflects what the customer is trying to achieve.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.1&nbsp; Building block decision tables
</h4>
<p>
    Build a table listing the Decision Points together with notes about the impact of each decision on the design of the
    building block.
</p>
<p>
    If, because of available resource and the size and complexity of the project, you are not able to answer all of the
    design questions, you should make it clear what assumptions have been made and revisit those questions when you proceed
    to a more detailed design.
</p>
<p>
    The following building blocks are covered in this paper:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Security<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        System Management<br />
    </li>
    <li>

                Encryption can be an expensive process and could impact the customer’s end-to-end budget. Deciding upon
                which messages or parts of a message need encryption and the type of message flow across a firewall may
                impact the design and certainly the technologies. Encryption technologies such as SSL can have a

            <td>
                <em>Basic Authentication</em> has a specific meaning within the Web Protocol. It is supported by most Web
                servers – including IBM HTTP Server - and allows simple control over access to files and directories based
                on a userid. There are two main shortcomings to this method: - The password is masked rather than encrypted
                for transmission, so this mechanism is not recommended for high-value transactions without some other form
                of authentication&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                - The browser caches the password and resubmits it on demand for later transactions. There is no explicit
                logoff mechanism. This makes it unsuitable for walk up-and-use kiosk applications. Unless a user remembers
                to close the browser, his identity can be assumed by the next user of the workstation.<br />

                This method authenticates a user with public/private key technology. The technique is used by web servers
                and by the standard X.509 certificates of the Web SSL v3 protocol. It requires infrastructure to issue and
                manage certificates.

    2.3&nbsp; Systems management and administration
</h4>
<p>
    Systems management is a very broad term, which encompasses many disciplines such as performance measurement,
    availability reporting, reactive problem reporting, software distribution, and updates, plus many types of problem
    determination tools. Caution must be exercised when applying traditional system management techniques to the Web, since
    many aspects of an Internet enabled environment are not under user control. This would apply to such areas as
    end-to-end performance or problem determination of network outages.<br />

            </td>
            <td>
                If not, you may need to factor into your design ways to develop the appropriate infrastructure. This will
                probably be more a financial consideration than system design, since it will probably involve hiring new
                skills, retraining existing skills, or commissioning the services of a third party service provider.

            <td>
                This depends very much on the nature of the customers’ business, although Web access is changing the nature
                of the way that many customers do business today. This may require supporting access from different time
                zones (typically across the Internet).<br />

                This can be an extremely variable factor depending very much on the complexity of the transaction, the
                number of concurrent users, the power of the CPUs serving these users, as well as network response times.
                On an Internet environment there is no way to accurately establish network response time. However, if
                despite the unknowns you can budget for end-to-end response, it will help to checkpoint each component
                within the building blocks during the design phase.

                    Key Internet technologies should be considered with respect to their affect on user response
                    time.<br />
                    -&nbsp;HTML is the common way to render pages on a browser; the information content of such pages can
                    have a significant affect on response time. Complex objects and images can significantly affect
                    download time, and hence the rendering time may cause workstation response to suffer.<br />
                    -&nbsp;Java applets may have slow download times, but subsequent interactions through their local
                    execution should improve workstation responsiveness.<br />
                    - The use of servlets of JSPs to run the presentation logic means that the clients only need to support
                    simple HTML output.

                relates to the downloading of special software such as applets, which may be needed to access the

                Will there be a requirement for the customer to expand their current user environment?
            </td>
            <td>
                This can occur as a result of growing the current intranet environment or adding Internet access capability
                to the current user environment. For the first situation this can be sensibly projected, and a network
                structure can be architected to allow for this future growth. The second situation is far less predictable
                and consequently far more difficult to plan for. Therefore, the points to consider are:<br />
                -&nbsp;Is it viable to have just one Web server for all potential Internet connections or do you route your
                HTTP requests to different Internet gateways in order to distribute the user load?<br />
                -&nbsp;If there is a requirement to download applets to each Internet browser that sends in an HTTP
                request, is it therefore necessary to distribute the Web server load across a number of different Web
                servers?<br />
                In either situation you should choose an architecture that allows you to scale your front-end to support
                additional Internet connections. It is essential to try to grow your front-end server support for
                additional users with zero or minimal disruption to the Web and Application server environment.

    2.7&nbsp; Application and data logic

<p>
    Application development will relate mainly to the programming requirements for the client, however there will be
    programming effort required at the server if client applications need to be downloaded prior to use.

                Has it been determined whether to use traditional programming development, object technology, or integrated

            </td>
            <td>
                Existing packages, if they meet the requirements, are usually faster to implement. However, object
                technologies such as C++, Java, or CORBA can offer benefits of speed and maintenance through their built-in
                reuse capability. Although you may only be looking at client application software at this stage, you should
                also look forward towards future server application architectures. If there is a requirement for the
                customer to make future server applications more object oriented, then it may be of advantage to consider
                these&nbsp; technologies for your proposed client applications.

                Is normal HTML presentation adequate, or should the user interface be enhanced through the use of Java
                applets?&nbsp;
            </td>
            <td>
                Java applets can be used to make the presentation more flexible and user friendly, especially in higher
                volume transaction-based applications. However, they take time to download and may be a concern over
                dial-up connections.

            </td>
            <td>
                A Java applet already has inbuilt security that only allows it to communicate with the Web server from
                which it was downloaded. If the browser needs to communicate with other Web servers on the network, then
                you should consider either the use of signed applets, or indirect connection through the applets’ own
                server, as a means of doing this.

                Is there value in placing some of the business application logic on the browser?
            </td>
            <td>
                You should determine how best to distribute presentation logic. You can, for example, use straight HTML on
                the browser, which implies that all validation of user input is carried out on the server. This may be all
                right for some applications where little input is needed from the user. However, if interaction is needed
                from the user as in a transaction-based application, can the server application support the amount of
                client-to-server interactions that this might produce? The use of Java and scripting languages should be
                considered as a means of placing more application logic in the browser, thereby reducing client/server
                flows.

                Will client-side scripting add any benefit to the function in the browser?
            </td>
            <td>
                JavaScript and JScript are languages, which are imbedded within the HTML, and when interpreted by the
                browser, can provide additional function to enhance the user interface and perform some validation of the
                user input. Because of incompatibilities between some browsers, you should ensure that you adequately test
                them in the environment in which you plan to use them.

<h4>
    2.8 Conclusion
</h4>
<p>
    What we have done is to look at each of the building blocks in their most basic form and to construct a set of decision
    points about which we can build the design criteria upon which to architect our solution. For each building block we
    would normally expect to see a list of alternative options from which we can choose to build our solution. In many
    cases, the customer will have imposed constraints or requirements upon us, which will narrow down these options. At
    this point in the design approach as discussed, we should have completed three important tasks:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Collected business requirements and other requirements from the customer with agreement from the customer that
        these requirements are correct, complete, and may be used to build the solution.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Developed a business scenario that represents the business processes, which your design will support.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Started the process of developing architectural alternatives to the customer’s business situation within the
        requirement definition provided by the customer.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    In the end as required review the design and revise it as necessary to satisfy availability, security, performance and
    system management requirements.
