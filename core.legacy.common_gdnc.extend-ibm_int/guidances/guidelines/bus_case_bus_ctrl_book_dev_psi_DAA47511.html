<h3>
    2. Context
</h3>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">As a diversified consulting firm, IBM Global Service provides a broad range of services
    to our customers. Regardless of whether we’re implementing hardware, software, or re-engineering their business one
    thing remains constant, clients ask IBM to enable changes in their business processes. These changes typically require
    a significant investment in capital, labor, and change in corporate culture. This is where the Business Case becomes a
    major enabler.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">A Business Case, as defined by IBM, contains a:</font></font>
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <font size="2"><font size="2">Text description of the reasoning behind taking a course of action</font></font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2"><font size="2">Detailed quantification of expected benefits</font></font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2"><font size="2">Detailed profitability analysis</font></font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2"><font size="2">Management controls and constraints identified</font></font>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">All elements have a high level of analysis depth for both tangible and intangible benefit
    quantification and focus on buy-in from Executive, Middle, and Line levels of management</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">The Business Case development draws from information identified and gathered for
    developing the Case for Change. That information is contained in the Business Strategy Assessment, Critical Issues,
    Opportunities and Recommendations, Preliminary Cost Benefit Estimate, and Principals for Harmonization</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">The opportunities identified and subjectively evaluated during the Case for Change, are
    further expanded and developed with more detail for cost, benefits, schedule, assumptions, responsibility, etc. as
    during the engagement and are documented in Opportunity Description</font><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><font     color="#0000ff" size="2">.</font></font> <font size="2">These will constitute a major portion of the input for the
    Business Case. Other major inputs for the Business Case are the High Level Gap Analysis and Estimated Preliminary
    Costs. This information will be combined with information from Risk Analysis and High Level Implementation Plan to
    define the information and operating parameters for the Business Case Development.</font></font>
</p>
<h3>
    3. Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    3.1 Plan the Business Case
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">The approach of the Business Case must be determined prior to the actual kickoff activities. The options
    are,</font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2"><b>Top Down</b> – Where the focus is primarily <b>financial</b>, with little involvement from
            middle or line management and staff. This results in a faster solution that directly affects the bottom line,
            but does not have the organizational buy-in from those necessary to affect the changes.</font>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2"><b>Bottom Up</b> – Where the focus is primarily <b>operational</b>, with great involvement from
            middle or line management and staff. This results in a solution with significant organizational buy-in, but
            that lacks focus and consensus, and has a much longer development time.</font>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2"><b>Hybrid</b> – Where the focus is <b>operational</b> with a clearly defined <b>financial</b>
            linkage to the bottom line, with involvement from a representation of executive, middle or line management, and
            the results are validated by a staff, where needed. This results in solution with strong local buy-in due to
            the middle or line managers acting as change managers.</font>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2"><u>The Hybrid approach is the recommended approach</u>. It offers the best balance of development cycle
    time, operational depth, and organizational buy-in.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Also, the appropriate IBM role must be discussed with the client prior to completion of the Statement of
    Work (SOW). Depending on the IBM role, our staffing and budgeted hours will change dramatically. The total client and
    IBM hours for Business Case development tends to stay the same within a project. The decision needs to be made who is
    responsible for gathering information and producing the final product, with appropriate hours assigned.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">There are two distinctive roles that IBM can play in the Business Case development process.</font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2"><b>Directive</b> – Where IBM performs most of the work and the client involvement is limited to
            being a data provider. This results in a shorter Business Case development cycle, but the client has little
            understanding of the process or how to use the information to control change when IBM leaves. There is no
            transfer of knowledge to the client and only limited organizational buy-in.</font>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2"><b>Coaching</b> – Where IBM performs lead development and the client staff is involved in the
            researching and development of the final product. This results in significant organizational buy-in and
            knowledge transfer to the client team, however it also increased the Business Case development cycle
            time.</font>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2"><u>The Coaching role is recommended.</u> Although it increases the Business Case development time, it
    adds significantly to the organizational buy-in for our clients. This aspect has major appeal to the Client Management
    team and should always be recommended in planning the Business Case.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">As stated above, the total Business Case development hours tend to stay the same within a project,
    however, using the directive role, the responsibility and hours are transferred back to IBM, thus raising the cost and
    at the same time lowering the organizational buy-in.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Once the approach and roles are defined, the principal/project manager will then be able to complete the
    Planning Timeline / Activity Decomposition forms. This will be used in the completion of the statement of work and the
    project budget</font>
</p>
<h4>
    3.2 Determine Client Business Strategy
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">The client’s business strategy is a major element in determining value for projects. There must be an
    alignment to the business strategy, or at least recognition of how the project relates to the business strategy, before
    the valuation process begins. Not providing the relationship of the project to the business strategy will always raise
    questions and increase uncertainty with the client management team</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">A full discussion concerning the intricacies of business strategy is outside the scope of this technique
    paper. However, it is appropriate to briefly review the business strategy’s relationship with the business case
    development.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Business strategy is the mechanism that guides the organization into the future. It includes the
    corporate Vision and Mission.</font>
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <font size="2">The <b>Vision</b> describes the values and long term direction of a company.</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">The <b>Mission</b> describes what business the corporation participates. In other words, what
            markets and products will the organization utilize to achieve its Vision?</font>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h4>
    3.3 Determine Client Business Structure
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">The business structure has three elements:</font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2">Process – that provides the value that customers buy</font>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2">People – to enable the process</font>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2">Technology – to enable the process</font>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2">A strong relationship and balance exists between these elements for a successful organization</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Business processes translate strategy into action. These processes are executed, enabled, and controlled
    by people and technology. The balance between these elements is critical to organization’s ability to achieve the
    stated mission.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    3.4 Gather Opportunity Description for Packaged Solution Integration Information
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">Over time, gaps develop between the corporate strategy and the ability to effect it through the business
    structure. These are called opportunities for improvement. Through the Business Case development process, IBM assists
    customers in identifying these opportunities, analyzing their potential contribution to the organization and
    determining which should be implemented.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">The goal of the business case is to determine which steps the client should take to eliminate the gaps
    between the business strategy and the business structure. It also quantifies the potential impact (costs and savings)
    of these changes on the organization.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Opportunities for improvement alone are not enough to determine the best use of an organization’s
    limited resources. In fact, when researched further, many of these opportunities may lie in non-critical areas or have
    negative returns. This is where Opportunity Value Propositions have an impact.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">An Opportunity Value Proposition starts with an opportunity for improvement. The high level opportunity
    was probably first identified in the Case for Change. This opportunity is further researched and developed as an
    Opportunity Value Proposition containing:</font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2">Potential benefit</font>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2">Potential cost</font>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2">Potential risk</font>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2">Probability of success (organization’s ability to make the change)</font>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2">The Best Practice Based Visioning Workshop is the primary technique for producing the Opportunity Value
    Proposition. Reference: Conducting a Best Practice Based Visioning Workshop Technique Paper.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    3.5 Develop the Business Case
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">The Business Case can now be developed that:</font>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            <font size="2">summarizes quantifiable benefits of all Opportunity Value Propositions</font>

<h4>
    3.6 Assemble the Business Control Book
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">The Business Control Book can now be assembled that:</font>
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">

<h3>
    4. Detailed Steps by Phase
</h3>
<p>
    <font size="2">The development of a Business Case involves the use of several skills. These include:</font>
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <font size="2">issue based consulting</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">process transformation / improvement</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">financial analysis</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">operational analysis</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">vertical industry knowledge</font>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">The theory behind of each of these skill areas is outside the scope of this document.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    4.1 Business Assessment Activities
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">Early on, cross-functional teams are set up for each process within scope. This is the time to organize
    the business case team and identify key resources as well. The business case team should have:</font>
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">a designated team leader, preferably from management</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">one member from each of the process teams (team leaders desirable)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">extended team (not full time, line managers and staff) members, where possible, for input and
            validation</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">Before process workshops begin, the Business Case team will meet to discuss the team’s role. During this
    meeting they should:</font>
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">be educated on the IBM Business Case approach</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">discuss how each of the processes will impact one another during the Business Case development
            process</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">review the timeline and management expectations</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">define baseline business case assumptions</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">As workshops are being run to map the current state, opportunities for improvement are being identified
    for each of the process areas. These opportunities end up in the Case for Change work product, which is the first step
    toward achieving the Business Case. The consultant needs to leverage <i>process transformation and vertical industry
    knowledge</i> skills to generate the opportunities.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">These defined opportunities are inputs into the Opportunity Value Proposition identification process and
    are identified and cataloged on the Opportunity Value Propositions Data Collection Form.</font><font     size="2">Throughout this phase the Business Case team should meet at least weekly to discuss progress.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><i>Issue based consulting</i> skills are used to identify each opportunity as a hypothesis and pursue
    analysis into each opportunity’s:</font>

<p>
    <font size="2">Later, the Case for Change is expanded further to define a client’s best practice based vision. The Best
    Practiced Based Visioning workshop is the technique used to expand the opportunities for improvement. The Opportunity
    Value Propositions are expanded further. This means identifying Best Practices that might resolve the issues in each
    opportunity for improvement area. And identifying specific metrics needed to measure best practice "enhanced"
    processes. The client’s current and target measures for each metric are identified. The best practice based vision
    bounds the future state definition and enables the development of:</font>

        </li>
    </ul>

<p>
    <b>Potential Risks</b>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">There are several methods available for performing detailed risk analysis. The theory behind these
    methods is out of the scope of this document. However, the risk analysis used in this step of the Business Case
    development process is simple. For each opportunity for improvement identified, an IBM consultant should help the
    client identify risks (internal / external) that could be posed if that opportunity is or isn’t adopted. Risk areas for
    analysis include:</font>
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">financial risk (e.g. cash flow, capital investment)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">operational risk (e.g. late delivery, discontinuity of operations, etc.)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">cultural/organizational risk (ability of culture to change)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">market risk (impairment to market competitiveness)</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <b>Probability of Success (organization’s ability to make the change)</b>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">The IBM consultant should take the information gathered in the Opportunity Value Proposition and assist
    the customer in determining each one’s probability of successful implementation in their organization. Based on the
    potential net benefit and the probability of successful implementation in the organization, the Opportunity Value
    Propositions can be prioritized.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">The result is the development of the Case for Change deliverable as well as a draft set of detailed
    Opportunity Value Propositions. This Opportunity Value Proposition information is approved by the Business Case team
    and passed to line managers and staff on the extended team for validation. This process is reiterated several times
    until the organization buys-in and agrees to take responsibility for the change and its associated benefits.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    4.2 Technical Assessment Activities
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">This is where potential technological enablers are reviewed for their ability to support the
    organizations best practice based vision. The primary focus is on standard software enterprise packages and potential
    bolt on’s. Once a technology is selected, the future state design will be developed within the bounds of this
    technology using the best practice based vision as input. <i>Process transformation / improvement and operational
    analysis</i> skills play a key role here.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><b><i>Note: Often the package is already known by the client and no formal Package Selection is
    required; however, a formal business case may still be within the scope of the project. Once the technology is known,
    the detailed project costs can be calculated and incorporated into the Business Case.</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">These costs must be broken-out into the same time buckets defined in the Opportunity Value Propositions.
    This will enable detailed project profitability analysis within a defined Business Case time horizon.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">The key financial measures utilized in profitability analysis should be, at a minimum:</font>

</table>
<p>
    <font size="2">The above are standard measures used to analyzing capital projects and are easily understood by
    executive management. Formulas to calculate these measures are available in most spreadsheet applications (including
    Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel).</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Once the Business Case development model has been created (e.g. spreadsheet, Advisory Tool, etc.)
    sensitivity analysis can be performed to see how robust the Business Case really is. This is done by changing the
    discount rate, annual benefits, annual costs, and value proposition mix. The goal is to find the "decision point". The
    Decision Point is where the Business Case team has balanced project profitability with their personal comfort level and
    can commit to and support the numbers.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">At this stage of Business Case development, it is common to have the client representatives reduce their
    potential benefits as they realize that these numbers will become firm management commitments. The IBM consultant must
    be able to calm the client through <i>coaching</i>. Being too conservative may incorrectly show that a project is not
    profitable. Being too liberal may show the project is profitable, when it is not. Either way, the client should be able
    to find a relevant range where they buy-in to stretch goals while maintaining a healthy amount of conservatism.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Finalizing the Business Case is the equivalent to an annual financial budgeting process. It will be the
    approved plan by which executive management will judge the success of the project. If needed, a summary of the business
    case can be used in the development of a Board of Directors presentation.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    4.3 Design Phase and Beyond
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">Once approved by executive management, the Business Case and Business Control Book is the plan by which
    executive management will judge the success of the project. It will also serve as input into the future state design to
    ensure that the best practice based vision is implemented. Of great importance to the project and organization is the
    ability of the future state design to track and calculate the Metrics defined in the business case. These provide the
    key to process control and improvement during and after implementation.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">As with any projection, Business Case numbers should be refined throughout the life of the project to
    reflect environmental changes. This will ensure the most accurate picture is being presented to executive management.
    The Business Case serves to build a level of trust between the implementation team and executive management through
    tight control and effective communication that they understand.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><u>Excessive deviation from the business case indicates that the best practice based vision isn’t being
    implemented or the business environment has changed dramatically and the project should be reviewed to assess its
    viability.</u></font>
</p>
<h3>
    5. Other Concerns
</h3>
<h4>
    5.1 The Business Case and Advisory Tool
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">The Business Case development procedures defined in this document apply equally for manual and automated
    delivery techniques. The Advisory Tool application, however, offers significant advantages.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Advisory Tool:</font>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">provides pre-configured industry models to start with</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">provides the direct links between Strategy, Process, Best Practices, Metrics, Benchmarks and
            Business Case</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">captures new capital in the field</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">captures historical engagement data (including business case) for future analysis</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">Advisory Tool supports the process of creating the Best Practice Based Vision and drives this through
    Business Case development. Advisory Tool is one of the key tools available to the PEBT community will collect and
    deliver reusable assets within IBM.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    5.2 Business Case Scalability, SMB Implications
</h4>
<p>
    <b>Scalability Options</b>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Not all customers need or want a full business case. Instances where this might occur include:</font>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">limited capital to invest in external consulting for a project</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">small, single site organization with active owner involvement</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">typical "theory X" directive management style (top down approach)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">project already approved, but pending financial validation</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">Small and Medium Business is typically an area where this applies.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Regardless of the client environment, a full Business Case development is preferred by PEBT over any
    other approach. This approach minimizes the impact of change during implementation and increases the probability of
    success tremendously.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><b><i>Where limited scope projects are delivered, the term Business Case should not be
    used!</i></b></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">In the instance that the client does not want to pursue full Business Case development, there are
    options that make this approach scalable.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    5.3 Project Justification vs. Business Case
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">A Project Justification includes the following elements of a Business Case:</font>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">potential benefits (tangible / intangible)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">potential costs (tangible / intangible)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">profitability analysis</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">In these areas, standard Business Case development procedures apply.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">A Project Justification does <b>not</b> include:</font>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">risk analysis</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">probability of success (ability of organization to change)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">detailed control book as a guide to process design and management to the best practice based
            vision</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">It’s sole intent is to provide a simple justification for a project at the executive level only.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Because of its financial nature, the Project Justification is developed using the top down approach with
    a directive role in IBM (see Supporting Documents: <b><u>Project Justification Outline.doc</u></b>). This approach will
    minimize the cost and cycle time of its development, while meeting its intended purpose.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><u>The Opportunity Value Proposition concept does not exist in a Project Justification. Analysis is
    simplified so that the minimum amount of work can be performed to justify the project to executive management. Given
    this, there is limited cultural buy in.</u></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">The following best practice based visioning elements must be available before the Project Justification
    can be developed:</font>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">critical business processes</font>

            <font size="2">opportunities for improvement</font>

        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">metrics to measure the process</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">In developing the Project Justification, the consultant should focus on:</font>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <font size="2">critical processes only</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">major benefits and costs associated with a process change (less detailed than a Business
            Case)</font>
        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">limiting analysis to the minimum needed for project approval (e.g. don’t calculate IRR if
            management does not require it for approval)</font>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <b>Opportunities and Risks</b>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">IBM’s goal is provide the proper services to our clients in terms of quality and risk. This requires
    professional skepticism going into any project. Each project should be reviewed prior to completing the Statement of
    Work to ensure that the proper work has been proposed prior to IBM’s engagement so as to ensure success.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">This is where the Project Justification can help. Although it can’t take the place of a solid business
    case, it can be used as a vehicle to "get in the door" and demonstrate IBM’s capabilities. Once with the client, a fair
    analysis can be performed to ensure that the proper pre-implementation activities have occurred. If not, this should be
    brought to client management’s attention and a Project Change Request pursued.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">In general, the Project Justification is useful for clients who:</font>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <font size="2">have chosen a package and want to move straight to implementation, but the process was halted

        <li>
            <font size="2">are small, have only enough capital available to implement a package, and need only simplified

            project and want an independent opinion</font>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">As mentioned before in this document, the Project Justification does <b>not</b> include:</font>

        <li>
            <font size="2">IBM performance will be judged using this document, yet, the analysis scope is limited</font>

        <li>
            <font size="2">Organizational change (buy-in) aspects included in a Business Case development effort are not

        </li>
        <li>
            <font size="2">It has limited use after project approval, since it provides a weak link between financial

        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>
    <font size="2">The bottom line is "Be careful when providing this service to our customers". Make absolutely sure that

    <font size="2">In developing the Business Case, we suggest the Hybrid approach. It offers the best balance of
    development cycle time, operational depth, and cultural buy in.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">The suggested IBM role is coaching. Although it increases the Business Case development cycle time, it
    adds significantly to cultural/organizational buy-in of our clients. This buy-in is key in increasing the probability
    of implementation success.</font>

    <font size="2">Don’t underestimate the value of intangible benefits. They often help push a marginal project through
    approval.</font>

<p>
    <font size="2">Where appropriate, a project justification can be used. Although this does not replace the Business
    Case, it provides IBM opportunities to compete in limited scope engagements.</font>
