    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    A change is an agreed to modification to the project scope or contract terms and conditions. The change may relate to
    either the work content or to the management of the project.
</p>There are two documents that are used to support contract change. 
<ul>
    <li>
        The Project Change Request (PCR) is the initial document that is used to record any change to the contract. It
        supports investigation of the impact that the change will have on scope, schedule, resources or any legal
        ramifications.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Change Authorization is the legal document that amends the Contract and results from a signed PCR.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    General Guidance
</h3>
<p>
    Used in conjunction with the Change Management portion of the Project Control Book, the Contract Change work product
    supports:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Development of an initial change plan for the proposed approach.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensuring that a process for capturing changes is in place and that the project team subscribes to it.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensuring that the change analysis, including impact and action plan, is kept up-to-date as the project
        evolves.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifying and planning for new changes that become apparent as the project evolves.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensuring actions to address changes are kept valid.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensuring that the change management process is adhered to, and that impacts on the project plan are
        understood.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensuring that required changes are correctly evaluated and priced.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The project may initiate many PCRs; however, only some of these may impact the Statement of Work.&nbsp; For those PCRs
    that do impact the scope of the contract (with or without financial impact), approval and client agreement is
    required.&nbsp; It is documented via the client and IBM signing a Change Authorization (CA).&nbsp; Some PCRs may be
    rejected by the client and should be logged as rejected and retained for reference.
</p>
<p>
    There is not necessarily a one to one correspondence between PCRs and CAs.&nbsp; Multiple PCRs can be processed with
    one CA.
</p>
<p>
    For PCRs with financial impact, IBM must formally approve the pricing prior to client submittal.&nbsp; As such, the
    same steps as followed in Proposal Management, Proposal Quality Assurance and Pricing and Contract Initiation for the
    original contract must be followed.&nbsp; At this point, the Project Manager will probably perform the role of Proposal
    Manager.
</p>
<p>
    The format of a CA should always use the legal format of ADD, REPLACE, DELETE.
</p>
<p>
    For Example:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Section 5.1 Project Management, Deliverable
    </p>
    <p>
        REPLACE:&nbsp; IBM will deliver one hard copy of the weekly status report.
    </p>
    <p>
        WITH: IBM will deliver one hard copy of the monthly status report.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Development of Contract Change
</h3>
<p>
    The following development approach is recommended:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify candidates for change.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluate change requests.&nbsp; Follow change control procedures agreed to in the SOW or IBM Customer Agreement and
        the Subcontractor SOW.&nbsp; An example from a template SOW contains the following wording: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                A Project Change Request (PCR) will be the vehicle for communicating change.&nbsp; The PCR must describe
                the change, the rationale for the change and the effect the change will have on the project.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                The designated Project Manager of the requesting party, either Client or IBM, will review the proposed
                change and determine whether to submit the request to the other party.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Both Project Managers will review the proposed change and approve it for further investigation or reject
                it.&nbsp; IBM will specify any changes for such investigation.&nbsp; If the investigation is authorized,
                the Project Managers will sign the PCR that will constitute approval for the investigation charges.&nbsp;
                IBM will invoice Client for any such charges.&nbsp; The investigation will determine the effect that the
                implementation of the PCR will have on price, schedule, and other terms and conditions of the
                Agreement.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                A written Change Authorization and/or Project Change Request (PCR) must be signed by both parties to
                authorize implementation of the investigated changes.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If the PCR scope is substantial, the IBM Project Manager will estimate the labor and charges for investigating the
        impact and implementation of the requested change and present these charges to the Client Project Manager for
        authorization to proceed with investigation.&nbsp; Both Project Managers will sign the PCR to acknowledge
        acceptance of these investigation charges.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Process contract changes.&nbsp; Seek pricing approval from the Designated Pricer if a proposed change could impact
        the project financially or change the identified risks.&nbsp; For PCRs with financial impact, IBM must formally
        approve the pricing prior to client submittal.&nbsp; As such, the same steps as followed in Proposal Management,
        Proposal Quality Assurance and Pricing and Contract Initiation (see WWQA/MD) for the original contract must be
        followed.&nbsp; PCRs must follow the same Quality Assurance and Pricing process within the delegated guidelines as
        set forth in each geography.&nbsp; An example of the steps a Project Manager would take are:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Prepare a Quality Assurance & Pricing package which among others things contains the proposed changes
                to the original contract and the estimating backups.&nbsp; It is assumed that all terms and conditions that
                were stated in the Statement of Work apply to the PCR unless stated otherwise in the PCR.
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide and review the DCA package with the delegated Pricer and QA person, who provide the final price and
                QA approval.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Present the IBM approved PCR to the client and obtain a signature on the CA/PCR
            </li>
            <li>
                Notify IBM Contracts and transmit the signed CA/PCR package to the appropriate location.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Subcontractor PCRs and Change Authorizations are created and processed following the same steps, as needed, for
        changes to the Subcontractors’ SOWs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Other
</h3>
<p>
    The Project Manager is responsible for following the Contract and local processes in managing this work product.&nbsp;
    The local Quality Assurance team as a part of the regular Project Reviews will review the change request.
</p>
<p>
    In order to familiarize the client with the change control procedures to be used in effecting a change to the IBM SOW,
    try processing a "clarification" or "no-charge" Project Change Request (PCR).&nbsp; Often this approach removes the
    apprehension associated with initiating a change along with the associated documentation and assessment.&nbsp; You
    should document any changes to scope with or without financial impact.
</p>
<p>
    Contact the local geography contract administrator to review the latest changes to the contracting process.&nbsp; The
    DCA form and DCA package will change periodically.
