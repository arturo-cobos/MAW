    <strong>1 Description</strong>
</p>The Case for Change is a final report that is the formal output of the Business Assess phase. It is used to make an
executive-level case for the need for the PSI project based on the Change Opportunities available for the client. This can
be accomplished as a stand-alone project, or as the first wave in a larger project, such as a Return on Investment Case.
<br />
It contains a listing and description of all the Change Opportunities that have been identified throughout the
investigations of the PSI project and recommendations for actions to investigate and validate each of these Change
Opportunities. 
<p>
    <strong>2 Context</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The primary purpose of the Case for Change is to document and communicate the results of the work performed in the
    Business Assess Phase in a final report.<br />
    The Case for Change is the vehicle to deliver valuable insights into the Client's areas of opportunity. It helps to
    clearly identify the specific change opportunities, immediately upon the conclusion of the investigative phase of the
    PSI project, and to recommend what actions should be taken in following phases to realize these opportunities.<br />
    The identified areas of opportunities and recommendations are the areas of “focus” in the Business Asses Phase, i.e.
    should form the “springboard” for entering the requirements specification and/or redesign phases of the PSI project.
    The Change Opportunities will also provide the background for detailed calculations in the Return of Investment Case or
    other Business Case.<br />
    The Case for Change should make it clear to the Client:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In what areas should change be considered?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why should change be considered in the identified areas?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the next steps proposed to validate and pursue the identified change opportunities?<br />
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>2.1 Contexts of Use</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.1.1 Case for Change Project</strong>
</p>Clients may design an entire project around the Case for Change. This is usually done if the client has recognized that
technology may improve their business, but are unsure of how, or which technology package specifically. In this instance
the consultant will look at the client’s strategy, review their processes to identify areas for improvement, and create a
Case for Change. The Case for Change outlines what improvements should be made, why they should be made, and what the next
steps are to validate the opportunities, quantify the opportunities, and/or identify the appropriate change vehicle
(technology package). 
<p>
    <strong>2.1.2 Return of Investment Case (Business Case)</strong>
</p>The Case for Change may be utilized as the first phase of a Return on Investment Case (or other Business Case). This is
usually done if the client has already identified the specific change that is desired and is looking to cost justify this
change. In this instance, the Case for Change is completed and delivered as the deliverable associated with the Business
Assess Phase of the project. The consultant will look at the client’s strategy, review their processes to identify areas
for improvement, and create a Case for Change. The Change Opportunities in the Case for Change will be quantified and
matched to costs in the remaining phases of the Return of Investment Case project. 
<p>
    <strong>2.1.3 Package Selection</strong>
</p>The Case for Change may be utilized as the first phase of a Package Selection. This is usually done if the client has
identified the type of change to be made, but has not determined the specific solution, or best solution provider. This
could also be done in combination with the Return on Investment Case identified in 2.1.2. In this instance, the Case for
Change is completed and delivered as a deliverable associated with the Business Assess Phase of the project. The consultant
will look at the client’s strategy, review their processes to identify areas for improvement, and create a Case for Change.
The Change Opportunities in the Case for Change will be utilized to create client specific process models and requirements
that will feed the Package Selection project. 
<p>
    <strong>3 Steps</strong>
</p>The Case for Change should by nothing more than a summary of the work produced throughout the Business Assess Phase,
presented in the way best suited to the way of thinking of the Client, thus ensuring that the message is clear and
unambiguous. It is during the development of the Case for Change that the findings and conclusions from all 3 domains come
together. <br />
The logical basis for any project should be the Issue Based Consulting approach and is certainly the foundation of the Case
for Change as well. Thus, these following steps should be taken to produce the Case for Change, i.e. the final report of
the Business Assess Phase. 
<p>
    <strong>3.1 Background</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Review the original proposal and sales case and develop the Background and Objectives chapter of the final document.
    This section of the presentation should be as short as possible, but setting the stage as to how the client came to the
    point of conducting the project, and what the project objectives are. This information is usually easy to gather from
    one of the following places:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Client issued Request for Proposal (or similar document)
    </li>
    <li>
        IBM’s response to the client’s Request for Proposal (or similar document)
    </li>
    <li>
        Statement of Work for the project
    </li>
    <li>
        Kick-off presentation for the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>3.2 Review the project team.</strong>
</p>Client team involvement is critical. You should document in the Case for Change all project team members, including
Core Team, Extended Team, Executives interviewed, and Project sponsor(s). It is important to document that the information
in the Case for Change was developed, validated, and supported by all levels of the client organization. 
<p>
    <strong>3.3 Review the process model</strong>
</p>Review the process model developed in the Business Assess Phase and develop the Process Model chapter. This section
lays out the processes analyzed during the project and the scope of the processes to be impacted by the recommended
changes. This section is usually in a graphic format utilizing Visio, Freelance Graphics, or MSPowerPoint. This is the
focal point to show the process improvements that make up the real benefits to be gained in the proposed solution. <br />
<i>Note: Depending on the commitments in the Statement of Work and the scope agreed to by the client, There could be
several approaches to this section.</i> <br />
Ø <i>Approach 1: Process Flow model</i> <br />
<i>This approach utilizes the business transformation process modeling approach and traces workflow and dependencies. This
approach provides a detailed layout for the processes and makes a solid base for a Business Process Redesign project.</i>
<br />
Ø <i>Approach 2: Process Decomposition Model</i> <br />
<i>This approach utilizes process hierarchy modeling and provides only a list of process tasks decomposed to an agreed upon
level. This approach proves a rigorous process related approach to the generation of Change Opportunities (and Process
Requirements in a process where the Case for Change is the first phase of a Package Selection project). This approach will
not detail workflows and process dependencies.</i> 
<p>
    <strong>3.4 Outline the client strategy and how the proposed solution supports that strategy.</strong>
</p>Review the Assessment of Future Business Goals and Measurements based on the executive interviews and the ‘Current
Process Definition and Assessment' work products such as BUS 306 Current Process Assessment and BUS 309 Process Definition.
From these work products or equivalent information, a Strategy Workshop Results chapter should be developed. This chapter
should list as a minimum: the agreed to Mission, Vision, Goals, Critical Success Factors, the Process Performance
Evaluation, and the Process Prioritization. 
<p>
    <strong>3.5 Identify Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Review the output of the ‘Critical Issues and Opportunities’ and the ‘Preliminary Cost Benefit Estimation’ Work
    Products (or equivalent information) to build the Change Opportunities. Each change Opportunity (a.k.a. Value
    Opportunity or Value Proposition) should be documented in a stand-alone document that will allow an opportunity to be
    easily added or deleted for the proposed solution as more information is gathered.<br />
    For each change opportunity you should document:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the issue that gave rise to the opportunity
    </li>
    <li>
        the related change opportunity
    </li>
    <li>
        Best Practices in the industry that contribute to the potential solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Any identified metrics that can be used to determine the base line process performance and track changes in
        performance as the solution is implemented
    </li>
    <li>
        all assumptions made
    </li>
    <li>
        any constraints, i.e., circumstances possibly hindering a successful implementation of the change opportunity or
        needed to be in place to ensure the same
    </li>
    <li>
        any expected benefits, as detailed in the ‘Preliminary Cost Benefit Estimation’ work product as well as any related
        costs
    </li>
    <li>
        the actions recommended in order to pursue the change opportunity, e.g., further investigations needed in order to
        validate/qualify the opportunity, rough plan for implementing the change opportunity to be further detailed in
        following phases
    </li>
    <li>
        any expected consequences of inaction, i.e., what will the likely consequences be to the client's business if no
        steps are taken addressing the specific issue
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>3.6 Conclusions</strong>
</p>Sum up the Change Opportunities in a Conclusions chapter, inspiring and motivating the client to go on to the next
phase with the suggested focus. 
<p>
    <strong>3.7 Next Steps</strong>
</p>Based on this, build a rough tentative project plan for the Next Steps chapter, that gives a realistic idea on the time
frame and deliverables of the following phases. 
<p>
    <strong>3.8 Presentation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Review the presentation with the Core Team and Extended teams to ensure that everyone is exposed to all parts of the
    presentation, not just the parts they worked on. Discuss the Case for Change report with the sponsor to allow for
    comments and revisions. Plan, prepare and conduct a session with the executive team to present your findings and be
    prepared to support your findings.<br />
    It is extremely important that each of the change opportunities, the related recommendations for action and any
    high-level cost/benefit estimation can be fully supported by the client's project sponsor and project team. A
    pre-review with each/all of these is imperative prior to presenting this material to a project steering committee or
    approval committee. Allow sufficient time in the schedule for such reviews and the subsequent presentation editing
    prior to the interim report presentation.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    <strong>3.9 Other</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        ALWAYS <b>use the issue-based consulting approach</b> for identifying change opportunities and developing
        recommendations, so each recommendation will be well supported, realizing that some will be unpopular with certain
        clients.
    </li>
    <li>
        ALWAYS be sure the <b>client project team participates</b> in the development of the recommendations and is bought
        into each of them.
    </li>
    <li>
        ALWAYS be sure that if any cost/benefit information is developed that the client project team develops the high
        level cost/benefit estimation and is willing to "own" the statement of anticipated benefits, estimated costs and
        assumed level of risk.4. Whenever possible, <b>ask selected client personnel</b> (i.e. the project sponsor, leader
        or key team member) <b>to present</b> the recommendations and cost/benefit estimation to the executive/steering
        committee as a statement of agreement and commitment.
