    1&nbsp;Description
</h3><b>Types</b> 
<p>
    The types of workshops vary greatly over the breadth of engagement types and client requirements. This technique paper
    provides general guidance to any workshop situations and does not attempt to discuss specific facilitation techniques
    relative to specific project content.
</p>
<p>
    The Guide should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The format of the information/topics that will be discussed during the workshop, including order of execution and
        timeframes<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The how topics will be delivered and the method in which team members should participate (i.e., anonymous voting,
        discussion, verbal voting, etc.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Any scoring or voting criteria that will be used and the scale of that criteria (i.e., numerical scoring from 1 to
        10 with 1 being worst and 10 being best)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Roles and responsibilities of participants, and estimated time frames, planned time frames should be reviewed with
        session participants and monitored, to facilitate gaining group consensus with these time frames, and/or making the
        appropriate adjustment to schedule and commitment.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        An example of the results of the workshop and how they will be used in the remainder of the project to ensure the
        relevancy of the effort and establish priority next steps
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Purpose
</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of this technique paper is to provide some practical guidance in the construction of agendas and selection
    of supporting materials.&nbsp; It is meant to support the development of a quick reference that the workshop
    participants (both IBM, client, and third party attendees) can use throughout the workshop to remind them of the
    process approach being used and how participant contributions will be most productive.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    This technique assists the consultant in planning a “strawman” agenda, gaining consensus of that agenda for the session
    duration, and then used for executing a workshop that successfully establishes and meets the client expectations. By
    publishing established sufficient process guidance to facilitate the workshop results being achieved, with roles and
    “voting rules” up front the intended bounds of participant responses and scoring scales can be represented, agreed to,
    and enforced.&nbsp; It should be a concise quick reference guide used by participants throughout the workshop.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    4.1&nbsp; Describe purpose of the workshop
</h4>
<p>
    Describe the purpose and objectives of the workshop&nbsp; – what it goals are and how they will be reached, and their
    importance in guiding the subsequent work.
</p>
<h4>
    4.2&nbsp; Define the workshop desired results
</h4>
<p>
    Describe the scope of the desired results of the workshop, especially as it relates to the identified stakeholder
    groups and time frames – what the outcomes are and how they will be documented.
</p>
<h4>
    4.3 Identify session ground rules and roles to manage participation
</h4>
<p>
    Identify and review workshop ground rules and housekeeping logistics (e.g., telephone access and use, message center
    facilities, scheduling interruptions). Ground rules that manage participation could be as specific as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        “In order to be recognized and contribute, one must raise one’s hand and be acknowledged by the facilitator”
        or<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        “As each topic is discussed, we will start with the first participant on the left of the room and work around the
        room until everyone has provided an opinion” or&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        “As a question is asked by the facilitator, each participant will write their response on the provided Post-It
        note.”
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Or have a much broader focus, such as:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We will respect the viewpoints of each participant.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        We start and end as a group
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Define and review workshop roles, responsibilities, and assignments. At a minimum lead facilitator, scribe, timekeeper,
    voting members, and tiebreaker, if applicable, should be identified.
</p>
<h4>
    4.4&nbsp; Define the workshop execution plan and scoring criteria, if applicable
</h4>
<p>
    Define and review key workshop topics, and the role assignments and process approaches associated with each.<br />
    The process approaches should include the design and review of templates that will be used during the workshop topics,
    to capture information, to facilitate brainstorming, to lead discussion or decision-making, or provide information; as
    well as the scoring criteria to be used, as applicable.
</p>
<h4>
    4.5&nbsp; Review workshop guide with participants
</h4>
<p>
    Verify that the client understands the purpose and objectives of the workshop&nbsp; – what it goals are and how they
    will be reached, and their importance in guiding the subsequent work. Solicit consensus for these objectives, and amend
    as required.
</p>
<p>
    Validate the scope of the desired results of the workshop, with participants. Solicit consensus for these results, and
    amend as required.
</p>
<p>
    Review workshop roles, ground rules and housekeeping logistics. Confirm these roles and ground roles with participants.
    Solicit consensus for these results, and amend as required.
</p>
<p>
    Confirm role assignments and process mechanics with participants. Solicit consensus for these results, and amend as
    required.<br />
    A significant and essential by-product of the use of the workshop guide technique is the consensus built around the
    results.&nbsp; By inviting input from all stakeholders with an interest in the outcomes of the workshop, and by leading
    them all through a structured and impartial process for the review of that guide, the consultant achieves the ‘buy-in’
    to the workshop.
</p>
<h3>
    5&nbsp;Validation and Verification
</h3>
<p>
    Validation and verification should be is done by the consultant team prior to the workshop, before presenting the
    agenda.&nbsp; All consultants on the team should review the guide and feel comfortable discussing any section within
    the guide.<br />
    Validate that client stakeholder groups and client executive management agrees to the approaches and results documented
    in the workshop guide and can articulate the value of the process used to develop the results.
</p>

<h3>
    7&nbsp;Advice and Guidance
</h3>
<p>
    A workshop guide is extremely important in most projects when workshops are first being held or when a different
    process/method will be used during the workshop.&nbsp; However, in projects where workshops are either not required or
    not applicable, a Workshop Guide would not be necessary. Or where, the client organization or another vendor or another
    IBM consulting organization is facilitating this interaction and can provide it in documented form.
</p>
<p>
    Use of a workshop guides that was created for prior workshops to the same goals can greatly reduce the amount of time
    required to develop a new workshop guide.&nbsp; However content and approach should always be tailored to the
    participant audience, and consensus making rules established and agreed to.
</p>
<p>
    Keep the Workshop Guide short but informative so that the client will want to use it as a quick reference during the
    workshop.
</p>
<h3>
    8&nbsp;Estimating Considerations
</h3>
<p>
    Workshop session planning, execution, and post-delivery activity duration can vary widely from project to project
    depending upon the scope and length of the workshop in question.&nbsp; A general rule of thumb therefore, would be, the
    number of planned session facilitators with equal duration each for the planning, execution, and post-delivery
    activities. That is, a two-day workshop would take 2 days to plan, 2 days to execute, and 2 days to follow-up for the
    level of effort assigned.
