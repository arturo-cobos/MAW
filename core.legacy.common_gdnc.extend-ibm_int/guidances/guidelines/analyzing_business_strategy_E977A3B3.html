</h3>
<p>
    The objective of this technique is to assist in discovering the corporate, business, and functional strategy, mission,
    vision, goals, and objectives of a business. The purpose of this analysis presumes a belief that any and all
    initiatives to manage knowledge should focus on either the knowledge needed to fulfill the business strategy as well as
    any excess knowledge within an organization that has the greatest chance of enhancing organizational value. More
    specifically, only through analyzing gaps between and among existing, required, competitor, partner, and customer
    knowledge can a knowledge management program be recommended that will in fact prioritize and then manage the most
    strategic knowledge to the organization. In order to successfully recommend a knowledge management program, the
    business strategy of the organization must be thoroughly understood. This technique paper provides an outline that
    covers the core areas of a business strategy. Adapt this outline to suit your client's and they engagement needs. It is
    rare that this outline will be used in its entirety.
</p>Note: Portions of this outline have been borrowed from-

<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Current Situation</strong>
</p>
<h4>
    Step 1A - Current Financial Performance
</h4>
<p>
    Chose relevant financial ratios to compute and analyze.&nbsp; Always benchmark ratios over time (adjusting for
    inflation) and against industry averages.&nbsp; The purpose for conducting this analysis is to see where the company is
    excelling as well as suffering so as to help build your business case for implementing knowledge management and
    learning programs.&nbsp; Examples of ratios to be used includeâ€¦
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Liquidity Ratios:&nbsp;Current, Acid Test, Cash, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Profitability Ratios:&nbsp;Net Profit Margin, Gross Profit Margin, ROI, ROE, EPS, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Activity Ratios:&nbsp;Inventory Turnover, Asset Turnover, Average Collection Period, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Leverage Ratios:&nbsp;Debt to Asset, Debt to Equity, Times Interest Earned, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Other Ratios:&nbsp;PE, Dividend Payout, etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 1B - Strategic Stance
</h4>
<p>
    Research the corporation's current mission, objectives, strategies, and policies.&nbsp; Decide and document whether
    they are clearly stated or merely implied from performance.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Mission:&nbsp; What business is the corporation in and why?&nbsp; What is the reason for the firm's existence?
</p>
<p>
    Objectives:&nbsp; What are the corporate, business, and functional objectives?&nbsp; What does the firm want to
    accomplish and by when do they want to accomplish it?&nbsp; Are they consistent with each other, the firm's
    capabilities, and the internal and external environment?
</p>
<p>
    Goals:&nbsp; Note that goals are similar to objectives however goals are more open ended and are not quantifiable nor
    are they given time constraints.<br />
    Strategies:&nbsp; What mix of strategies (comprehensive master plan of how the corporation will achieve its mission and
    objectives) is the corporation following?&nbsp; Are they consistent with each other, the firm's capabilities, and the
    internal and external environment?
</p>
<p>
    Corporate Strategy: Overall direction in terms of general attitude towards growth.
</p>
<p>
    Business Strategy:&nbsp; Occurs at the business unit level
</p>
<p>
    Functional Strategy: Approach taken by functional unit to achieve corporate and business objectives.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Policies:&nbsp; What are they?&nbsp; Are they consistent with each other, the firm's capabilities, and the internal
        and external environment?&nbsp; These are the broad guidelines for decision making that links the formulation of
        strategy with each implementation.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 2 - Corporate Governance
</h4>
<h5>
    Step 2A - Board of Directors
</h5>
<p>
    Consider who the board of directors is. Are they internal or external and/or do they own significant shares of
    stock?&nbsp; Is the stock privately held or publicly traded?&nbsp; What do they contribute to the corporation in terms
    of knowledge, skills, background, etc.?&nbsp; What is their level of involvement in strategic management?
</p>
<h5>
    Step 2B - Top Management
</h5>
<p>
    Determine who represents top management formally and informally.&nbsp; This will require an analysis of not only the
    formal organization chart but informal ones as well.&nbsp; The informal information is more difficult to find but can
    usually be secured from a trusted inside source.&nbsp; One armed with the organization information determine top
    management's chief characteristics in terms of knowledge, skills, style, background, etc.&nbsp; How long have these
    people been with the company?&nbsp; Were they hired internally or externally?&nbsp; Length of time with company can
    hint at how change is viewed by the company.&nbsp; What is their approach and level of involvement to strategic
    management?&nbsp; Is top management sufficiently skilled to cope with future challenges?&nbsp; How well does top
    management interact with the board as well as lower managers?&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 - External Environment: Opportunities and Threats (SWOT)
</h4>
<h5>
    Step 3A - Secondary External Issues
</h5>
<p>
    Which of these forces and factors are the most important to the corporation and to the industries in which it competes
    at the present time?&nbsp; Which will be important in the future?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Economic<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        GDP Trends<br />

</ul>
<h4>
    Step 3B - Primary External Issues
</h4>
<p>
    This can be done primarily using a "Porter's Five Forces Model".&nbsp; Here is an outline of a similar model with
    additional forces to consider as well. Consider which of these forces and factors are the most important to the
    corporation and to the industries in which it competes at the present time?&nbsp; Which will be important in the
    future?
</p>
<p>
    New Entrants: New entrants to an industry.&nbsp; Consider entry barriers such as knowledge, economies of scale,
    switching costs, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Competitive Rivalry: The degree of the effect of a competitive move.&nbsp; Some of these are number of competitors,
    rate of industry growth, height of exit barriers, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Substitutes:&nbsp; Those products that appear to be different but can satisfy the same needs as another product.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Buyer Bargaining Power: Can they force down prices, increase quality requirements, readily find alternatives, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Supplier Bargaining Power: Can they raise prices or reduce quality.&nbsp; Do they sell a unique product or one with
    high switching costs?
</p>
<p>
    Specific Industry Dynamics: For example, most high tech firms receive most of their profits from products and services
    developed within the last 6 months.
</p>
<p>
    Competitor Knowledge/Learning: Does the firm's competitors have substantially advanced learning and knowledge
    capabilities?
</p>
<p>
    Other Forces: Power of unions, governments, special interest groups, etc.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4 - Internal Environment: Strengths and Weaknesses (SWOT)
</h4>
<h5>
    Step 4A - Internal Issues
</h5>
<p>
    Which of these forces and factors are the most important to the corporation and to the industries in which it competes
    at the present time?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Which will be important in the future?
</p>
<p>
    Culture: The collection of beliefs, expectations, and values learned and shared by your client's employees.
