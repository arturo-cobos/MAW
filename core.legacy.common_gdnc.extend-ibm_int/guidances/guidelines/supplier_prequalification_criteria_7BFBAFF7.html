    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    This technique paper provides background for determining a list of supplier pre-qualification criteria specific to
    strategic commodity sourcing.
</p>The Supplier Pre-Qualification Criteria Technique captures valuable information provided from the supplier’s RFI
responses. This information helps the team evaluate each supplier's viability as a commodity provider to the client.
Capture the following information about the suppliers, where available: 
<ul>
    <li>
        General
    </li>
    <li>
        Company Profile
    </li>
    <li>
        Contact Information
    </li>
    <li>
        Stability & Focus
    </li>
    <li>
        Duration in Business
    </li>
    <li>
        Installation Base
    </li>
    <li>
        Financial Status
    </li>
    <li>
        Industry Experience
    </li>
    <li>
        Technology Overview
    </li>
    <li>
        Functional Capabilities (high level)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The BT Consultant will use the supplier information to analyze each potential supplier’s ability to satisfy the initial
    future capabilities and attributes identified by the client. The Supplier Pre-Qualification Criteria Technique assists
    in completing this task in order to eliminate suppliers to reach an interim list of suppliers.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Purpose
</h3>
<p>
    To provide a standard method for assessing the best supplier to source a given commodity based on supplier capabilities
    and business fit.&nbsp; The criteria will help to establish qualified suppliers.
</p>
<p>
    Assists the project team in creating and evaluating a “long list” of potential suppliers in order to identify an
    “interim list” of suppliers that best meets the needs of the client.
</p>
<p>
    The supplier pre-qualification criteria provides validation of an “interim list” selection and reduces risk to the
    success of the engagement.&nbsp; Without the supplier pre-qualification criteria which details each supplier’s overall
    viability as a provider, it is difficult to determine whether or not each supplier offers the general functionality,
    stability and technology to satisfy the client’s goals and objectives for their sourcing strategy.
</p>
<p>
    By eliminating the supplier pre-qualification criteria, you do not fully utilize valuable information gathered and
    increase your exposure on the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    Developing the criteria would be optional when the client has provided the “interim list” of suppliers and has
    contractually indicated that IBM did not assist in the selection of that list.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Notation
</h3>
<p>
    The supplier pre-qualification criteria provides a summary view of information gather about the “long list” of
    suppliers for comparison and elimination of suppliers.&nbsp; It captures data on the overall stability of the suppliers
    and their products as well as their industry focus.&nbsp; It provides overviews of the suppliers’ technology and
    functionality, as well as providing general information about the suppliers for review by the team.
</p>
<p>
    This technique is normally developed in a series of spreadsheets, but may be created in a database or in word
    processing tables.
</p>
<p>
    The supplier pre-qualification criteria should consist of the following work sheets or pages:
</p>
<h4>
    3.1&nbsp; Title Page
</h4>
<h4>
    3.2&nbsp; General Information
</h4>
<p>
    This section captures company profile information such as name, locations, number of employees, contact data, web
    sites, etc.
</p>
<h4>
    3.3&nbsp; Stability/Focus
</h4>
<p>
    This section details company history information such as number of years in business, industry focus, and client
    base.&nbsp; It may also be used to capture financial performance and risk assessment information.
</p>
<h4>
    3.4&nbsp; Technology Overview
</h4>
<p>
    This section details the supplier’s technology infrastructure and capabilities.
</p>
<h4>
    3.5&nbsp; Functionality Overview
</h4>
<p>
    This section outlines the functional capabilities of the commodity or service being offered by the supplier against the
    functional criteria identified by the client.
</p>
<h4>
    3.6&nbsp; Supplier Elimination
</h4>
<p>
    This section details the elimination of suppliers from consideration, listing the reason for elimination.
</p>
<h4>
    3.7&nbsp; Interim List
</h4>
<p>
    This section identifies the resulting “interim list” of suppliers that will be considered going forward in the
    engagement.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;Development Approach
</h3>
<p>
    The supplier pre-qualification criteria are developed by the IBM Sourcing Team members upon receipt of the supplier
    responses to the Request for Information.
</p>
<p>
    Prepare the supplier pre-qualification criteria according to the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Collect the supplier responses to the RFI.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Clarify responses, if needed, and validate information from the supplier where appropriate.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Research any missing information from the supplier.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Populate the template and adjust to meet the specific needs of the client.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluate information against the supplier list to determine elimination of suppliers based on client criteria,
        document reasons for elimination<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate the “interim list” of suppliers for review with the client.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    5&nbsp;Validation and Verification
</h3>
<p>
    The pre-qualification analysis should be validated through checking the vendor responses against the data captured in
    the template.&nbsp; Research should be performed to validate financial data and the use of third party research should
    be included in the analysis where appropriate and available.
</p>
<p>
    The Summary worksheet should be validated with the client team lead to ensure agreement on the elimination criteria
</p>
<h3>
    6&nbsp;Estimating Guidelines
</h3>
<p>
    The time to develop this Technique varies depending on the engagement, available resources and vendor data
    available.<br />
    Range of Effort (hours) for Best of Breed Selection (1-2 Resources)
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        HIGH&nbsp;120<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        LOW&nbsp;&nbsp; 80
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Range of Effort (hours) for Single Vendor Solution (1-2 Resources)
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        HIGH&nbsp; 80<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        LOW&nbsp; 40
    </li>
