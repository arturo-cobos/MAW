<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">Before we go any further letâ€™s stop and think what we mean by performance objectives - they can be expressed in the
following ways: 
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Responsiveness</b> - a measure of how quickly the system responds to an end user request
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Throughput</b> - a measure of how many requests of the same type the system can process in a given unit of time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Scalability</b> - the ability of the system to be scaled cost-effectively to handle greater (or occasionally
        lesser) volume and deliver greater throughput whilst still meeting an acceptable level of response.
    </li>
</ol>Performance objectives come under the category of "non-functional requirements" and are easy to neglect during the
design phase of applications. It is often mistakenly thought that application performance problems can be fixed by "tuning"
exercises towards the end of the build and test cycle, however this is a risky approach which often leads to serious
problems during the later phases of projects. Typical tuning efforts may be expected to improve performance by anywhere
between 10% and 100% but rarely much more than that. Experience shows that when performance objectives are not considered
during the early phases of a development project, it can often turn out that the <i>design</i> contains fundamental
constraints which mean the performance and scalability objectives - which may be contractually binding - are unachievable.
If this is discovered late in the project lifecycle, the design may need to be changed at the last minute, perhaps
fundamentally, with damaging consequences for the development and testing already performed.

</table>Designing for performance and scalability is a discipline, which requires an understanding of the ways in which
applications can be performance-limited, and the ways in which these limitations can be overcome. This skill must be
combined with a thorough consideration of the hardware and software infrastructure on which the application will be
running; only from this basis can the best decisions be made during application design. 
<p>
    This paper aims to provide a grounding in the techniques required to design applications with performance in mind from
    the outset. Its benefit is to reduce the risk of designing applications, which cannot meet their performance
    requirements.
