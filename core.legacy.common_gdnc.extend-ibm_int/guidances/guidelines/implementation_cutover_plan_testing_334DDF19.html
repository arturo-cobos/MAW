</h3>
<p>
    The objective of this technique paper is to identify steps to corroborate assumptions and logistics identified in the
    Implementation Cutover plan. This document may be considered a quality control checklist for consideration during the
    period leading up to full deployment.
</p>Deployment, or cutover planning, is a set of tasks which both the client and project team agree are necessary to
install and test the new system. Verifying that the cutover plan is workable and complete is crucial to ensuring the plan
is built properly, that the installation will be seamless, and ultimately, that the user will not be unduly interrupted. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>Testing a cutover plan encompasses the following major areas: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensuring that data conversion and data migration can be implemented securely
    </li>
    <li>
        Verifying the readiness of all hardware, software and infrastructure components
    </li>
    <li>
        Verifying that user needs before, during and following cutover, will be met
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The purpose of this technique paper is to provide guidance on the steps in assessing the readiness of all stakeholders
    to accept and use the new system and to confirm the testing steps which must be completed before cutover commitment
    takes place.
</p>The steps within each section may be performed in parallel, or in any sequence. The steps may involve large communities
within the organization, from purchasing to facilities management, and/or from training departments to help desks. Each of
these verification steps must be coordinated by joint teams involving the project manager (IBM and client), systems
architect, developers, testers and business users.

            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>When verifying cutover plans, some high-level recommendations include: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Adhere to a regimen of staged sign-offs or approvals (e.g. "go" / "no go" decisions) as you execute the cutover
        plan to ensure that tasks within each step do not get missed
    </li>
    <li>
        When qualifying what functions require scrutiny in the cutover plan, consider those functions which match the
        criteria "high risk, high usage, and /or high visibility"
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure all contractual obligations will be met by the implementation
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate that all objectives are met as evidenced through system testing
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    A checklist of verification steps form the basis of testing an Implementation Cutover Plan:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Verification of training, education, and skill levels<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Verification of timing of cutover including schedules and milestones<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Verification that infrastructure and components are in place<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Verification of site surveys, site plans, and specifications<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirmation of user support readiness prior to, during and following cutover<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirmation of hardware and software acquisition, delivery and installation logistics<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Verification of data backup, conversion and migration procedure&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Review Preparedness and confirm expectations of user community
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The following subsections describe these verification steps in more detail:
</p>
<h4>
    2.1&nbsp; Verification of training, education, and skill levels
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Selected training strategies are consistent or compatible with the current or planned end user technology
        environment 
        <ul>
            <li>
                If several methods were used to provide training, verify the suitability of the training method to suit
                user needs<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Where a group of users have difficulty completing work in a test environment, re-evaluate whether the
                training method or level of detailed instruction is at fault
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Additional training is planned to provide expanded user knowledge and in-depth training for key users<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Procedure manuals and user instructions have been exercised during Acceptance testing. Errors caught during testing
        should be re-tested using walkthroughs and pilot install techniques<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        New roles staffed and new responsibilities are documented as verified during User Acceptance<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consideration has been made for those who will be involved in pilot tests (advanced training) or parallel
                testing (additional staff) when staffing<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Objectives of user training have been met as measured by the user community 
        <ul>
            <li>
                All usability and operability functions are accepted by the user community<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Customization of menus required to access new system has been completed and verified 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Typically, main menu panels must be updated to enable access to new system functions<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        All user ids,&nbsp; passwords, and network access have been made available to meet the rollout schedule<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintenance team to support new application is staffed and trained<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Mentoring has been considered as a means to augment training&nbsp; 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Responsibility has been assigned and individual acceptance of the role has been obtained<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        A pre-rollout pilot is&nbsp; scheduled to verify user training, user documentation, and staffing
        requirements&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cutover rehearsals have been scheduled and conducted 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the experience to refine time estimates, document procedures, and identify gaps
            </li>
            <li>
                After making changes, walk through the schedules and documentation to ensure that the process continues to
                ‘make sense’
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.2&nbsp; Verification of timing of cutover including schedules and milestones
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Verify that schedule does not conflict with highly ‘sensitive’ timeframes such as period end, month end, quarter
        end, etc.&nbsp; Also, avoid periods of high business/transaction volumes, if possible<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Sequencing of activities has been reviewed<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Schedule allows for reasonable delays in shipping or setup such that equipment can be operational before the
        cutover or pilot processing begins<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Schedule allows time for restoration of the old system (fall-back plan) prior to the final “go/no go” decision.
        Include:<br />
        - &nbsp;Library reallocation<br />
        - &nbsp;Disk/file reallocation<br />
        - &nbsp;Existing database and file conversion<br />
        - &nbsp;New database and file loading<br />
        - &nbsp;Network switch over<br />
        - &nbsp;System parameter switches<br />
        - &nbsp;Old system backup<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cutover plan is built according to milestones (e.g. cutover tasks to be completed 2 weeks prior to going live, 1
        day before going live, weekend of going live, first day after going live, etc.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Time is allowed after cutover before clean-up operations commence to ensure system stability<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Skills have been identified:<br />
        - &nbsp;Proper resources have been assigned/committed according to the schedule<br />
        - &nbsp;Each task is assigned to an individual and confirmation of the completed task will be relayed to the
        cutover coordinator<br />
        - &nbsp;A clear and complete responsibility matrix is agreed upon and communicated to each team member, including
        users, quality assurance (QA), technical support, architects, network specialists, and project managers (PMs)<br />
        - &nbsp;Note that although frequently the test manager and application development manager are not directly
        involved in the cutover, they should be on site during the cutover for support purposes because of their experience
        with the system
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.3&nbsp; Verification that infrastructure and components are in place
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project reporting procedures, escalation procedures, and issue management are in place up to the client management
        and sponsor level until the project is officially closed<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Change Management is engaged and prepared<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Problem Management is engaged and prepared<br />
        -&nbsp; The Project Manager should be prepared for “hard-ball” decisions on whether a problem is really a Severity
        1, 2, or 3.&nbsp; Although it may contradict the original plan, with the stakeholder’s approval, many installations
        often decide to proceed into production with Severity 2 problems outstanding depending on the risk incurred<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Space allocation is checked against latest volume predictions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Operations and systems management teams are fully advised and have approved desired schedules including staging of
        systems, and backups, as well as fallback/recovery stages<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A centralized ‘burn-in’ center has been established to setup workstations, load software and verify consistency and
        accuracy of installation prior to shipment to the final destination<br />
        - &nbsp;This is an effective tool to maximize use of resources and improve quality of the workstation
        configuration<br />
        -&nbsp; The burn-in center has an additional advantage of providing a single receiving point for components (e.g.
        UPS, PC, cables and software may come from different locations)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Installability testing performed:<br />
        - &nbsp;Is the installation document complete and correct?<br />
        -&nbsp; Is machine-readable data in the correct format?<br />
        - &nbsp;Can the JCL or EXECs be tailored to meet local standards<br />
        - &nbsp;Are all required components in the installation package?<br />
        - &nbsp;Does the installation package include test data? Does it run?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Are installation tuning parameters provided? Are they documented?<br />
        Environment testing performed:<br />
        - &nbsp;All required members and files have been transferred to the production libraries<br />
        -&nbsp;&nbsp;Application works in production environment (e.g. through a pilot test or running the application on
        the weekend etc.)<br />
        - &nbsp;All batch jobs run with all job and file dependencies satisfied and can be completed within batch
        processing window<br />
        -&nbsp; All situations, such as daily and month-end, tested<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Metrics are in place for measurement and processes developed to correct deficiencies<br />
        -&nbsp; Processes in place to collect / assimilate all information<br />
        - &nbsp;Performance measurement tools enabled<br />
        - &nbsp;Predicted volumes in place, reporting scheduled and reporting audience prepared<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Security procedures have been tested during Acceptance testing and all issues resolved<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Old system has been left in place for backup purposes for an adequate period of time although transition to the
        production environment has already occurred<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Software Configuration Management (SCM) is established:<br />
        - &nbsp;Service level objectives are in place<br />
        - &nbsp;SCM activities are planned, and the plan is documented and approved by all stakeholders<br />
        - &nbsp;Selected software work products are identified, controlled and available<br />
        - &nbsp;Changes to identified software work products are controlled and problems are recorded/reviewed<br />
        - &nbsp;Installation includes a basic installation verification check to ensure all components are
        operational<br />
        - &nbsp;Affected groups and individuals are informed of the status and content of software baselines<br />
        - &nbsp;Project follows a written organizational policy for implementing SCM<br />
        -&nbsp; A board having authority for managing the project’s software baselines exists<br />
        -&nbsp; A group responsible for coordinating and implementing SCM for the project exists<br />
        - &nbsp;Members of the SCM group are trained in procedures and methods to perform SCM activities<br />
        - &nbsp;Standard reports on SCM activities are developed and made available to affected groups<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.4&nbsp; Verification of site surveys, site plans, and specifications<br />
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Inventory of locations including current addresses, cable identification, and LAN ids is available<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Updated inventory including cross-reference of changes to current sites and new locations is available<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Transition plan to accommodate changes is established<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        All outstanding orders are checked:<br />
        - &nbsp;No backorders exist<br />
        - &nbsp;All deliveries are scheduled<br />
        - &nbsp;All receiving location addresses are verified and personnel have been notified<br />
        - &nbsp;All shippers are confirmed<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Access to all locations by assigned personnel is authorized, including third party suppliers, and their
        agents<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        All phone orders, lines, number assignments, deactivations, and reconfigurations are confirmed<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Circuit diagrams are updated and complete
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.5&nbsp; Confirmation of user support readiness prior to, during and following cutover
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Support roles are defined and staffed<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Support criteria are defined:<br />
        - &nbsp;Help desk questions<br />
        -&nbsp; Error reporting processes<br />
        -&nbsp; Feedback mechanisms<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        User support criteria is met as verified during acceptance tests<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Requirements compared to final delivery functions are traced, a gap analysis has been performed, and final sign-off
        from users has been obtained<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Full staff support is in place during cutover, key processing periods (first business day, weekend, month-end,
        etc), system catch-up phase (recovering from deferred transactions during planned system outage), and
        back-out/recovery, if necessary<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Communications plan is established:<br />
        - &nbsp;Cutover to a new system utilizes more staff and impacts more people than at any other time in the life of
        the project.&nbsp; Although communication occurs throughout cutover, the importance of effectively communicating –
        progress, problems, updates – is critical to successful deployment. A cutover ‘kick-off’ meeting is one technique
        that sets the direction for all follow-on tasks.&nbsp; The cutover kick-off meeting should have, as its purpose, to
        review all items which are new and potentially unfamiliar to the participants such as:
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Objectives of the rollout and the rollout acceptance (exit) criteria
    </p>
    <p>
        Roles and responsibilities of each participant
    </p>
    <p>
        Cutover plan and schedule and fallback procedure in case of an outage or failure of the new system
    </p>
    <p>
        Batch data transmission schedules
    </p>
    <p>
        Contents of the documentation
    </p>
    <p>
        Help desk procedures
    </p>
    <p>
        System support procedures
    </p>
    <p>
        Production procedures
    </p>
    <p>
        System startup and shutdown procedures and schedule
    </p>
    <p>
        Security procedures
    </p>
    <p>
        Data backup and restore procedures
    </p>
    <p>
        New report formats and distribution schedules
    </p>
    <p>
        Manual procedures which are being introduced
    </p>
    <p>
        Audit procedures
    </p>
    <p>
        Processes to be followed to phase out the old system
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Executive communications very important - A status call-in phone number is established for executives/decision
            makers to hear a voice recording of up to minute progress during cutover.&nbsp; In practice, this has proven to
            be a very efficient, effective, and time/cost saving technique to keep executives informed<br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Notification process is prepared and ready to send according to defined schedule identifying each planned
            disruption<br />
        </li>
        <li>
            A communication plan must also consider what information is pertinent to the general public, especially in the
            light that the new deployment may suffer setbacks in terms of decreased functionality, decreased performance or
            total rollback to conditions prior to cutover acceptance.&nbsp; This part of the plan and its various
            contingencies must be developed and reviewed very early in the cutover strategy process to enable all
            stakeholders to consider wording, timing, media, etc.<br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Pagers are available to contact decision-makers during cutover
        </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        All workflow procedures and processes are consistent with the ‘new’ system and infrastructure. (Cutover will
        undoubtedly be ineffective if the business process surrounding the new system implementation has not been
        effectively tailored.)
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.6&nbsp; Confirmation of hardware and software acquisition, delivery and installation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; logistics
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Hardware / software meets scalability targets for deployment based on expected transaction volumes and rollout
        targets<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk mitigation process is in place in case volumes exceeded and/or schedules advanced<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        PC software and associated device configuration standards are established, and rollout and installation plans are
        verified via a walk-through<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        As cutover begins, there will a need to identify, and correct misinformation.&nbsp; Here are some of the situations
        which often occur and the plan must address them: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The client machine is not the same configuration (software or hardware) as that originally
                inventoried<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                The client machine is correctly configured but when software is installed, it appears to operate
                differently than expected (e.g. Perhaps due to additional conflicting software, or a virus)<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                The client machine is correctly configured and the installation goes smoothly, but the user operates the
                device in a non-conventional manner.&nbsp; This concept of users of new systems acting in an erratic manner
                is frequently prevalent and may cause large increases in Help Desk calls, or server transaction volumes.

<h3>
    2.7&nbsp; Data backup, conversion and migration procedure verification
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Backup procedures are in place and scheduled<br />
        -&nbsp; Application must be capable of being restarted after failure (e.g. restoring data sets, backing out
        changes, restarting or canceling jobs<br />
        - &nbsp;Copies of critical programs, data, and documents stored off site as part of the vital records program<br />
        - &nbsp;The following should be tested:
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Can a checkpointed program be successfully restarted from a checkpoint?
    </p>
    <p>
        Can a batch job be successfully restarted at any step marked restartable
    </p>
    <p>
        Can a batch job be successfully cancelled and rerun another day
    </p>
    <p>
        If an on-line program fails, are partial data updates correctly backed out?
    </p>
    <p>
        Can vital record data be used to recreate the application?
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        All tasks that must be performed manually are staffed, backups are assigned, backout procedures are in place, and
        training has been completed<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Conversion, migration, and archive strategy and criteria are in place<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Procedure to access archived data is documented and distributed to all users and has been tested<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Data conversion specifications may be site specific; thus, instructions for each site have been tailored as
        necessary<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Data owners (3rd party, department, individual) have signed off acceptability<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Data verification reports have been run and checked for accuracy (hash totals)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Data initialization verification has been performed<br />
        - &nbsp;Run jobs with null data as typical with conditions to be expected of a new system (e.g.&nbsp; new period
        end, new month-end, etc.)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        All entry and exit criteria are met during User Acceptance testing under ‘live’ conditions<br />
        -&nbsp; Each data extraction, conversion, data formatter, copy or archive process is exercised, results are
        verified under ‘live’ conditions<br />
        -&nbsp;&nbsp;Data conversion/ migration should be tested immediately before going live and data used as input to
        start-up cycle to test compatibility with new system being implemented<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Define and communicate limitations of Database Fallback and Roll Forward<br />
        -&nbsp; After x number of production hours/days, a database fallback may no longer be possible and/or
        practical.&nbsp; The window to update the old database with production transactions since the cutover may be
        impractical or impossible<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Test and verify all interfaces to the new system including manual, automated<br />
        -&nbsp; All systems have interfaces, whether to a human/manual process, a legacy system, or a recently introduced
        client server application. Frequently, interfaces involve business partners such as EDI applications, web
        applications or electronic transmission of business data. Each of these interfaces represent points of failure
        which must be thoroughly tested, results verified and signed off before deployment.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.8&nbsp; Review Preparedness and confirm expectations of user community
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Degree of schedule attainment during Acceptance testing is an indicator of level of user readiness<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Think about the unthinkable – develop a fallback plan and establish a formal plan to invoke it with the user
        community.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan must include go-no go decision points, communications steps, in addition to full
        details.&nbsp; Be clear in terms of the desired fallback position (eg.&nbsp; How much to back out, final
        configuration/ level of software the client machine should end up with, etc)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make precise decision trees with user executives about who calls a fallback<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not assume that users will continue to react the same way immediately after cutover<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                For example, users who were used to getting system responses in a certain time period, knowing there was a
                new system at work, would do things that were not at all reasonable such as re-booting, canceling and
                re-entering etc. This drives the transaction load up on parts of the system far beyond the design
                points<br />
            </li>
            <li>
                As an offset against getting unexpected behavior from users, test their role in cutover by reviewing
                expectations with them.&nbsp; Provide users with an understanding of the following considerations:
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Value and Function they will obtain right away
</p>
<p>
    Value and Function they will see over a longer term
</p>
<p>
    Limitations or impact they may expect in the short term, such as events that may cause them to feel anxiety in the
    first 5 minutes, during the first week, etc.&nbsp; Rehearse the steps to communicate problems so that implementors can
    fix them
</p>
<p>
    Based on the pilot or user acceptance tests, review changes that have occurred that they may not be expecting
</p>
<p>
    Rehearse the users role in the fallback plan
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Try to predict the number of Severity 1, 2, and 3 errors that exist before cutover starts and those that will arise
        during and following cutover.&nbsp; Attempt to get user agreement to this number<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        When users know they had approved a cutover with X number of Severity 2 errors, this can make the hours/days/weeks/
        after cutover much less stressful
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.9&nbsp; General Hints, Tips, and Considerations
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        The process of thinking, planning and conducting rehearsal cutovers and fallback provides the team with a great
        deal of confidence in the final cutover.&nbsp; Cutover rehearsals are done with a view that you will never need to
        fallback.&nbsp; However, the process of thinking about fallback often points out areas where partial fallback is
        possible. This in turn provides insights to cutover activities that can be reorganized to make the staging of the
        cutover in smaller phases with intermediate checkpoints a possibility (e.g. some place where data stands still for
        a little while). This can reduce project risk<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Perform a risk assessment<br />
        -&nbsp; The cutover plan must be very thorough. Consider using static walkthroughs.&nbsp; Review what to
        test.&nbsp;Review schedule and resource plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure that any vacation constraints are reflected in the
        project plan<br />
        -&nbsp; Focus on high risk, high usage and high visibility functionality and/or applications.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp;
        sometimes only one application is being implemented and a focus is on the functionality)<br />
        - &nbsp;Set client expectations at the outset<br />
        - &nbsp;Ensure that you have client consensus/sign-off<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Document for each step of conversion process:<br />
        - &nbsp;What the major points of failure or risk are<br />
        - &nbsp;Completion criteria<br />
        - &nbsp;Steps to backout<br />
        - &nbsp;Steps for manual override<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Encourage a "Learning Organization" - hold a post-implementation review for “lessons learned”
    </li>
</ul>
