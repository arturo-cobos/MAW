    <strong>1 Description</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This Technique Paper provides overview information regarding Risk Mitigation during Packaged Solution Implementation
    projects. Any business initiative involving an ERP implementation will confront potential obstacles to success. It is
    important to identify and address these obstacles early to minimize their negative effects. The purpose of this
    document is to explain the Risk Mitigation Process that will be used to identify and manage the possible barriers to
    the project’s success.
</p>
<p>
    The Risk Mitigation Process explains how to deal with obstacles by creating Risk Mitigation Projects that contain
    Action Steps to be completed by Risk Mitigation Teams with the assistance of the Organization Change Management Team
    and Project Management. Data collected during Business Impact Workshops forms the foundation for the Risk Mitigation
    plan.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2 Context</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The IBM approach to Risk Mitigation consists of a series of workshops, tools, and subsequent activities used to
    identify both severe and likely risks, activities to identify appropriate mitigation activities for these risks, and
    activities to mobilize risk mitigation teams.
</p>
<p>
    Projects will typically have a very detailed project plan for the technical aspects of the package implementation.
    However, managing all the changes and risks associated with people and processes is often overlooked, or
    underestimated. If these risks are not addressed, the system implementation will likely fail to meet the business
    benefits and project objectives.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3 Steps</strong>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.1 Identify risks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Business Impact Workshops (BIWs) are structured to allow project team members to participate in the process of
    identifying and qualifying potential risks to the implementation project.
</p>
<p>
    BIWs to identify strategic risks may be conducted as early as the Prepare Phase of the project. Participants of these
    strategic BIWs are typically steering committee, project management, and project team leads.
</p>
<p>
    BIWs to identify tactical risks are typically performed following the Re-design/Design Phase of the project. <i>(N.B.
    Until Re-design/Design is completed, teams are generally not aware of the impact the implementation may cause.)</i>
    Participants of the tactical BIWs are project team members and extended project team members. Tactical BIWs are
    typically performed for each major process affected by the implementation, e.g. Order to Cash, Purchase to Payment,
    Plan to Manufacture, etc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.2 Evaluate risks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Input the data from the BIW into the Business Impact Workshop Data Collection and Analysis Template [Sample].
</p>
<p>
    During the BIWs, the workshop participants qualify the severity of the potential risk by assigning level of impact to
    people process and technology. The workshop participants also qualify the likelihood of the potential risk. After the
    data from the workshop is input into the Business Impact Workshop Data Collection and Analysis Template [Sample], the
    data is reviewed. It is not uncommon for the results for an individual item to be contrary to the intent of the
    workshop participants, e.g. the wording of a potential risk may result in the assessment by participants placing the
    risk in an inappropriate quadrant. Any obvious miscoding is corrected.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.3 Assign owners</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Business Impact Analysis Workshop (BIA) serves as a vehicle to review the data from the BIWs. The Business Impact
    Analysis Workshop Presentation [Sample] can be tailored for the specific client to introduce the client to the analysis
    process. During the review of the BIW data, potential Risk Mitigation Projects (RMPs) are identified.<br />
    The RMPs are assigned to a RMP owner who will be accountable for completing the RMPs.
</p>
<p>
    RMP owners are those individuals within the organization who have ultimate accountability for managing the RMPs and who
    will report progress of RMPs during regular business-to-business meetings. Typically, RMP owners are one level below a
    steering committee member and will use personnel from appropriate business areas and functional teams as resources to
    perform the change activities required by the RMPs.<br />
    On average, the activities of a RMP owner will require a 20% time commitment each week beginning and continuing through
    the Implement Phase (or RMP completion, if earlier).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.4 Define Risk Mitigation Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Organization Change Management team facilitates the functional teams in identifying RMPs that will be completed to
    address potential risks that are both severe and likely to occur.
</p>
<p>
    Once RMPs and RMP owners have been identified, Risk Mitigation teams must be formed.
</p>
<p>
    Risk Mitigation team members are those individuals within the organization who have the business expertise required to
    execute RMPs. On average, the activities of a Risk Mitigation team member will require no more than a 20% time
    commitment each week during the execution of a RMP.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.5 Develop RMP Action Plans</strong>
</p>With input from the Organization Change Management team, each Risk Mitigation team creates an Action Plan for each RMP,
including Action Steps with expected start and completion dates. 
<p>
    <strong>3.6 Manage and Track Risks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Facilitated by the Organization Change Management team, the Risk Mitigation teams implement action steps. As necessary,
    Risk Mitigation teams seek assistance from Organization Change Management to facilitate issue resolution surrounding
    these action steps.
</p>
<p>
    The process owners communicate status on RMPs in regular business-to-business meetings.
</p>
<p>
    The project manager communicates the status of the Risk Mitigation Projects to the Steering Committee at regular
    meetings.
</p>
<p>
    <b>3.7 OTHER:</b>
</p>
<p>
    Two consultants best facilitate each workshop.
</p>
<p>
    For strategic BIWs: 4 hours is required for preparation, 4 hours is required to conduct the BIW. Following the BIW, 4
    hours is required for data entry and analysis, followed by 4 hours for the BIA workshop. Subsequent risk mitigation
    activities are typically incorporated into the project plan or deferred to later in the project for strategic risks.
    Therefore, strategic BIWs typically require approximately 32 hours consulting time.
</p>
<p>
    For tactical BIWs, 4 hours is required for preparation, 4 hours is required to conduct each BIW. Following the BIWs, 4
    hours is required for data entry and initial analysis for each workshop, followed by 8 hours for the BIA workshop. Risk
    Mitigation Project Owner Kickoff presentation requires 8 hours for preparation and 2 hours for delivery. For each RMP,
    8 hours is required to work with each RMP Owner to identify action steps. Managing the RMP process and facilitating RMP
    teams requires 4 hours per RMP team per week for an average of 8 weeks. Based on four core processes resulting in 10
    RMPs, tactical BIWs and subsequent activities require approximately 528 hours consulting time.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Benefits:</b>
</p>
<p>
    The Business Impact Workshops (BIW) and Risk Mitigation Process Execution are particularly useful in the transition
    involving ERP, CRM or SCM systems. Business Impact Workshops are generally conducted after the implementation team has
    held the business process design meetings and developed more detailed information regarding the business processes and
    the technology needed to support the business objectives of the project. When these results are combined with the
    output from the Organization Readiness Assessment and the Change Leadership interviews, a broad picture of the scope of
    the change effort will emerge. A detailed Transition Management Plan can then be developed to manage the change.
    Identifying, prioritizing and mitigating the highest level risks early in the implementation will also help the
    organization focus on realizing the business benefits of the ERP, CRM or SCM project. Risk Mitigation Process Execution
    is an excellent tool to drive broad-based participation – a critical success factor for change initiatives. Personnel
    from across the organization become involved in key decisions and risk mitigation activities resulting in wider
    acceptance of the change initiative.<br />
