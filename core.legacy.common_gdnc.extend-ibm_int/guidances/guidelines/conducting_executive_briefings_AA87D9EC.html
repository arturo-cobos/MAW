    The <b>Knowledge Management Executive Briefing</b> is a CRM (customer relationship management) technique used to
    establish, build and maintain a relationship with a client’s executive management team. It is often the first step in
    establishing IGS credibility as a potential supplier of Knowledge Management (KM) products, services and solutions.

<p>
    The following section summarizes the approach for each of the above steps:
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Step 1 – Establish purpose, attendees and objectives
</h4>
<p>
    This step should be considered from two perspectives – the clients and IBM’s.
</p>
<p>
    From IBM’s perspective the purpose of the briefing should be made explicit by whoever is requesting the briefing.
    Typical purposes are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To establish IBM’s credentials in the KM field.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To educate the client on IBM’ latest KM products and services.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To promote a specific KM solution or offering.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To gain sponsorship for a KM project<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To solicit the client as a member of the Institute for Knowledge Management (IKM).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is not an exhaustive list of potential objectives but should be used as a guide.
</p>
<p>
    From the client’s perspective whoever requested the briefing should provide all speakers with a list of attendees and
    relevant background. A suggested format is:
</p><br />
<br />
<table title="" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="85%" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Attendee Name
            </td>
            <td>
                Job title
            </td>
            <td>
                Attendee Name
            </td>
            <td>
                KM awareness and interest level&nbsp;
            </td>
            <td>
                Personal objective for attending
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table><br />
<br />
<h4>
    Step 2 - Prepare draft agenda and determine speakers, location and facilities
</h4>
<p>
    The draft agenda should be constructed to meet both the client and IBM’s objectives. It should try to draw from
    existing content where possible.
</p>
<p>
    Typical content modules are:
</p>
<p>
    KM Overview presentation (aka ‘common’ DNA) – this is owned by the KM project Office. A copy is usually posted in the
    KM IC database. This is intended to explain the business imperative for KM and establish linkage to overall e-business
    strategy and messages from IBM.
</p>
<p>
    KM Strategy presentation – several samples are posted in the KM IC database or Global KM Workroom. This is intended to
    give the client an understanding of how to begin a KM program, focusing on the activities necessary to develop a
    knowledge strategy.
</p>
<p>
    KM Product Overviews – Lotus Sales Tools contains most of the software group standard KM product presentations.
    Additional product content on specialized or emerging technologies from IBM research and software group should be
    considered, information on these can be found through the intranet.
</p>
<p>
    KM Service and Solution Offerings presentations – several samples are posted in the KM IC database or Global KM
    Workroom.<br />
    Industry specific e-business and knowledge presentations – these are often customized from existing sector e-business
    presentations.
</p>
<p>
    Consideration should also be given to inviting external and/or other client speakers.
</p>
<p>
    Key Note – a slot on the agenda should be given for the client to articulate their current KM plans and future
    intentions.
</p>
<p>
    A suitable location should be determined and booked ensuring appropriate facilities are available. Consideration should
    be given to utilizing the Lotus Executive briefing centers at Cambridge, Boston and Staines, UK.
</p>
<p>
    Once a draft agenda is constructed and location chosen suitable speakers should be found. A balance of local and global
    speakers should be considered based on attendee profiles and opportunity assessment. The KM speakers’ bureau (part of
    the KM project office) can recommend speakers for all KM topics.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 - Research industry specific knowledge issues and case studies
</h4>
<p>
    Although the standard KM presentations can be used to build an agenda that will address the client’s objectives it is
    recommended that all speakers are briefed on the current business context of the clients company and industry. In
    addition each presentation should use case studies pertinent to the client’s industry where possible. Many IGS regions
    have dedicated consulting research assistants who should be utilized to provide a brief report on the client and its
    industry. Other useful sources of background information are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The client’s web site.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The client’s annual report.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        IGS ICMS for the specific industry and KM.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        IGS intranet – especially the case study category.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 4 – Finalize agenda and prepare content
</h4>
<p>
    Once all speakers have been confirmed the agenda should be published in final form to all speakers for reference and
    the client for confirmation that the agenda will meet their objectives. Should the client request changes to the agenda
    these should be accommodated where possible and alternative speakers found if required.
</p>
<p>
    Content should be prepared using a consistent smartmaster (look and feel) which support the KM branding of IGS. All
    presentations should be customized to the extent that they:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Show an understanding of the client’s business environment.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Display the client’s logo (at minimum on the title pages).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Use relevant case studies to illustrate IBM’s experience.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 5 - Rehearse and modify content
</h4>
<p>
    Although it is often very difficult to get the speakers together to rehearse before the briefing this should be the
    objective where possible. Rehearsal should focus on the content and flow; ensuring minimal overlaps of content,
    consistent messages and logical transition between presentations.
</p>
<p>
    An alternative to face-to-face rehearsal is to organize an e-meeting.
</p>
<p>
    At absolute minimum – if no form of rehearsal is possible – one person should take responsibility for running through
    all of the content and suggesting modification to individual speakers. This should be done at least 48 hours prior to
    the briefing.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 6 – Deliver briefing
</h4>
<p>
    One person should act as ‘master of ceremonies’; welcoming the client, introducing speakers and facilitating
    discussions. All presentations should encourage interaction and be presented drawing on good presentation skills and
    practices.
</p>
<p>
    To demonstrate a deep understanding of the KM subject matter all speakers should be encourage to use stories drawn from
    their personal experiences to illustrate key points.
</p>
<p>
    The client should be given the opportunity to articulate feedback at the end the briefing with their views of potential
    next steps.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 7 – Debrief and follow up
</h4>
<p>
    After the briefing, the IBM speakers should convene to debrief the event and agree next steps and action ownership.
