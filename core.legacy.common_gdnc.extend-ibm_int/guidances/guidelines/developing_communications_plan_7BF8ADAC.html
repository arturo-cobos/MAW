<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">This is an age of unprecedented challenge for most companies. In response to these challenges, most companies are
undertaking a variety of improvement projects. The Controller’s Division is frequently involved in these projects, and
often takes the lead with system implementations and other changes that impact both its own Division and other
organizations within the company. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>

</table>Most companies have experienced the disappointment of a failed project. Although there are many reasons for project
failures, one common risk is inadequate communications. Although project managers agree that effective communications are
necessary, communication efforts often fail to achieve targeted results for a variety of reasons. For example, many
communication efforts lack consistent focus and adequate attention, particularly when the project gets into later stages
and other priorities seem to be more pressing. Also, the communications may fail to address the need for multiple
communication media and message repetition. Most people are surprised to find out that it may take nine or more separate
communications of a single message to ensure that the target audience has received the message. In addition, many of
today’s projects impact groups of people who are geographically dispersed. This raises the challenge of being effective
with communications, especially when the project crosses national boundaries. 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>The people who need to do their work differently as a consequence of the project need to prepare for the changes
the project will entail. Project communications are one important ingredient to this preparation. Also, if the
communications are done in an effective manner, other benefits will be achieved: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Sponsorship for the project can be clearly demonstrated through careful consideration of the proper people to
        deliver key communications
    </li>
    <li>
        Reasons for the project and expected benefits can be communicated, which can be important factors in building
        adequate motivation toward the project
    </li>
    <li>
        The project vision can be repeated with increasing levels of detail so that it becomes well understood and
        actionable
    </li>
    <li>
        Speculation and gossip may be reduced when people are confident that the formal communications will be complete and
        timely
    </li>
</ul>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>Also, since many companies have not communicated effectively on previous projects, an effective communication
campaign on a new project may signal a positive change to the people within the organization. This change may help to
overcome organizational inertia caused by previous implementation problems. 
<p>
    Project communications need careful planning, development and delivery to be an effective response to the
    organizational need for awareness, understanding, and preparation for action. This chapter describes a framework that
    companies can use to develop an effective communication program for implementation projects.
