    Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Step 1 – Create Gap Analysis Report&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
    During to-be process design, the teams will identify areas of desired functionality that are suspected to be outside
    the limits of the standard IBM asset.&nbsp; These areas need to be documented as gaps in order to document their
    existence.&nbsp; At minimum, the gap's name, brief description of the desired business functionality and the asset's
    functionality should be included in the documentation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Process teams
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work product:</strong> Gap analysis report
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 – Perform Gap Functional Detail Analysis
</h4>
<p>
    In order to properly determine the impact and risks associated with the suspected gap, the functional needs of the gap
    must be documented.&nbsp; These needs must also have four other pieces of information tied to them: business benefit
    and value of the function, risk associated with not delivering the function, project risk associated with delivering
    the function, and impact of deferring the functionality past implementation.&nbsp; The gap analysis team is notified of
    the gap.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Process teams
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time</strong>: 1-2 days
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Gap functional detail document(s)
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 – Evaluate the IBM asset Coverage
</h4>
<p>
    The functional analysis matrix will be used by the IBM asset experts to confirm that the desired functionality is
    indeed outside the limits of standard the IBM asset.&nbsp; These conclusions will be made based on discussions with the
    proper experts, experiences of the IBM asset resources, and the IBM asset help files.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> IBM asset consultants and IBM asset skilled resources, gap resolution team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Updated Gap functional detail document(s)
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4 – Refine Business Process Design
</h4>
<p>
    Using the benefit / risk / defer matrix, process teams critically evaluate the business drivers behind the suspected
    gap. The business process is then redesigned to encompass only the functionality that is deemed to be essential, for
    which there is a strong business driver. These alternatives have the smallest impact on project timelines and the IBM
    asset software.&nbsp; At this point, the gap can remain at the sub-project level. If the over-all business process can
    be executed in the standard IBM asset with minimal impact or an acceptable work-around can be developed, this option
    should be selected as the solution for the gap.&nbsp; If no functional extension outside standard IBM asset
    functionality is needed, the process skips to Step 19: Close Gap.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Who:</strong> Process teams, the IBM asset experts, bolt-on functional experts, gap resolution team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1-2 days
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Updated gap analysis report, and revised process flows.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 5 – Identify and Rank Functional Requirements for Gap Resolution
</h4>
<p>
    The functional analysis matrix is updated to include all needed functionality for the gap resolution as per the
    redesigned process.&nbsp; These items are prioritized in order to define an objective list of standards for the
    intended solution.&nbsp; Additionally, the business case for the functions is refined with more rigor than above.&nbsp;
    A log is created by the gap analysis team in order to consolidate the individual functional requirements, rate them,
    and summarize their costs or benefits.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Key process team members from all affected processes and gap resolution team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2 days
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Updated Gap functional detail document(s), gap functionality log
</p>
<h4>
    Step 6 – Estimate Coverage and Propose Gap Resolutions
</h4>
<p>
    Estimate the costs and the level of coverage that the available solutions (e.g. bolt on, extension, etc.) could
    provide.&nbsp; The process team will match the functional needs identified above with the features typical of the
    intended solutions.&nbsp; The analysis includes both functional requirement coverage and feature/functional extensions
    that have a high degree of compatibility with the client goals. The solution will need to be evaluated not only by a
    coverage rating, but a rating that will give quality points for probability of success of the enhancement and the
    project. A preliminary decision is made as to the type of the gap resolution.&nbsp; This investigation needs to take
    into account the risks and costs associated with the various options available and the business needs of the solution.
    Section II - Gap Analysis of the gap resolution document is updated with these conclusions.
</p>
<p>
    A key part of this investigation is future IBM asset software release functionality.&nbsp; This alternative is
    investigated with IBM asset experts.&nbsp; By analyzing the details of future functionality and the timing of its
    availability, the solution to the gap functionality may be determined to be met by future IBM asset
    functionality.&nbsp; If this is determined to be the case, an explanation of the future functionality is drafted, and
    key users sign-off on the solution.&nbsp; The gap is considered on-hold pending the availability of the future IBM
    asset release functionality and upgrade plans.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Process teams & gap resolution team, with the IBM asset and bolt-on functional experts as
    appropriate
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Updated gap analysis report
</p>
<h4>
    Step 7 – Steering Committee Approval of Gap Resolution
</h4>
<p>
    The gap functionality log, gap functional detail reports, and gap analysis report will be used in order to support the
    determination the type of the gap resolution.&nbsp; The type of the gap resolution is confirmed and signed off on by
    the steering committee, and a subset of the steering committee is identified for final approval of the gap (if
    necessary).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Steering committee, gap resolution team, subject matter and process experts
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2 days
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Updated gap analysis report
</p>
<h4>
    Step 8 – Investigate Process for Improvement Opportunities
</h4>
<p>
    The functional limitations of the design teams are expanded to include only those functions that were agreed above to
    be critical needs within the proposed gap resolution. At this time, the process should be investigated to insure the
    optimal process within these new constraints is being designed.&nbsp; Parallel or redundant processes and functions
    that it makes sound business sense to do outside the IBM asset are potentially moved into the gap resolution object.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Process teams and gap resolution team, with the IBM asset and bolt-on functional experts as
    appropriate
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Updated gap analysis report, process flows, and gap functionality log
</p>
<h4>
    Step 9 – Apprise IT Infrastructure Personnel of Gap Resolution
</h4>
<p>
    At this point, IT infrastructure personnel should be advised of the nature of the gap resolution so they can start to
    incorporate its additional needs into their workplans, and so they can determine additional infrastructure
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team and IT infrastructure team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day
</p>
<h4>
    Step 10 – Generate Solution Analysis Scenarios
</h4>
<p>
    The Gap functional detail document(s) serves as a driver for the generation of test scenarios to insure that the
    eventual solution meets the needs as defined by the process teams.&nbsp; Unless the desired solution is a bolt on, the
    next step will be Step 15: Recommend Solution Strategy & Tactics.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team and process team members
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2 days per function (est. 1 week overall per gap)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> solution analysis scenarios for gap
</p>
<h4>
    Step 11 – Develop Long Vendor List and Educate Selection Team
</h4>
<p>
    A long list of capable vendors is generated from IBM and team member experiences and research.&nbsp; Only vendors with
    capabilities in the functional area of investigation who are known by team members will be considered.&nbsp; As a part
    of the generation of this list, all team members are educated about the capabilities, histories, and products of each
    of the vendors.&nbsp; Vendor market literature and delivered functionality is captured throughout this process.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1-2 days (3 weeks overall)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Market intelligence for long list vendors within the gap resolution team.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 12–&nbsp; Prepare Evaluation Matrix
</h4>
<p>
    The analysis of the vendors’ material will generate a list of functions that each vendor’s product has.&nbsp; The next
    step is the development of a matrix, rating the vendors’ ability to meet the functional needs of the client, along with
    other factors such as technology, distribution, IBM asset integration capabilities, access to capital, installation
    base, management, vision, and intangibles.&nbsp; A ranking of importance of each feature will be documented.&nbsp; IBM
    knowledge capital will be leveraged as a part of the matrix generation process.&nbsp; The primary input to this is the
    functional analysis matrix generated above.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2 days.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Ranked analysis matrix
</p>
<h4>
    Step 13 – Develop Short Vendor List
</h4>
<p>
    Select the “best fit” vendors, preferably two and usually no more than four, based on the “must have” criteria on the
    vendor evaluation matrix.&nbsp; It may be a necessity for these vendors to be IBM asset partners, depending on the
    client.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1-2 days of team negotiations
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Short List
</p>
<h4>
    Step 14 – Solution Selection
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Conduct Vendor Presentations
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is a full disclosure of the requirements to the vendors.&nbsp; Depending on the subject, and the competitiveness
    of the vendors, this may be a single kickoff or individualized meetings.&nbsp; It is important for the external
    consultant to be interfacing with the vendors to facilitate a level of continuity, information flow and adherence to
    the requirements.&nbsp; IT infrastructure experts should be present in order to clearly communicate their concerns.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team, key users, IT infrastructure personnel
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1-2 days/vendor
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> None
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Conduct Vendor Demonstrations
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The vendors will present their solutions to the decision team and the executives, based on the solution analysis
    scenarios developed above.&nbsp; The scope of this section can vary greatly from a simple overhead presentation, to a
    user data demo, or a full conference room pilot.&nbsp; Depending on the scope of the demonstration the vendor may or
    may not require funding.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team, users
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 3-4 weeks
</p>
<p>
    Work products: Vendor supplied solution document
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Evaluate References
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The team and key users should communicate with all vendor supplied references as a part of the evaluation process.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team, key users
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1-2 days/reference
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work product:</strong> Assurance of a workable solution
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Select Vendor
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A vendor is selected and the gap analysis report document is updated with the pertinent information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day, average elapsed time 1 week.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work product:</strong> <strong>Selected</strong> vendor, updated gap analysis report document
</p>
<h4>
    Step 15 - Recommend Solution Strategy & Tactics
</h4>
<p>
    In this process, the work effort for the implementation team must be established.&nbsp; Major building blocks for the
    solution are established. Document the recommended project plan with time frames and resources estimated.&nbsp;
    Additionally, update the projected return on investment in the functional analysis matrix, and document the metrics
    suggested to be able to measure the progress. At this point, all project elements associated with the gap resolution
    need to be clearly documented and scoped.&nbsp; For example, if a gap requires a bolt-on with interface and
    configuration needs, these efforts all must be clearly documented and workplans need to be generated / updated to
    include these items.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team, implementation team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 week
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work product:</strong> Project plan and Benefits statement
</p>
<h4>
    Step 16: Deliver Final Gap Resolution to Infrastructure team
</h4>
<p>
    The IT infrastructure team will be informed as to the exact gap resolution in order that they may finalize their
    workplans and develop the infrastructure requirements for the gap resolution object.&nbsp; If the solution is not a
    bolt on, skip to Step 19: Close Gap.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap resolution team, implementation team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work product:</strong> Project plan and Benefits statement
</p>
<h4>
    Step 17 – Present to Steering Committee Subset for Approval
</h4>
<p>
    All of the above work products are formatted to create a presentation for the steering committee justifying the
    selection of the vendor and the implementation plan.&nbsp; The steering committee then signs off on the solution.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Steering committee, gap resolution team, subject matter and process experts
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Updated gap analysis report document
</p>
<h4>
    Step 18 – Negotiate / Contract with Vendor
</h4>
<p>
    Finalize the documentation with a full list of Work products, Terms and Conditions, Staffing, and the most important
    Completion Criteria.&nbsp; The inclusion of the vendor specifications in the functional Matrix, should have many of the
    T&C’s already known disclosed and resolved.&nbsp; This will optimize the final paper work.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> The client’s purchasing with the support of the gap resolution team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 week
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Contracts approved and signed
</p>
<h4>
    Step 19 – Close Gap
</h4>
<p>
    Sign off that the gap has been resolved to the satisfaction of the gap owner, and update the status to “Closed” in the
    gap analysis report document.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap owner
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 1 day.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work products:</strong> Updated gap analysis report document
</p>
<h4>
    Step 20 – Formal Hand-off to Implementation Team
</h4>
<p>
    The gap analysis team and the implementation team meet in order to transfer the knowledge of the gap resolution to the
    implementation team. The project is officially transferred to the implementation team.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who:</strong> Gap analysis team, implementation team
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2 days
</p>
<p>
