    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    An Integration Test is conducted to prove that a module or group of interfacing modules operates as expected and that
    the program code performs as defined in the module specification. If an existing Integration Test Plan is being reused
    as a basis for this Integration Test Plan (Form 12) ensure that the Integration Groups accurately reflect this
    Maintenance Work Item.
</p>
<p>
    When resolving a Problem Log, some of the test conditions will already have been identified as part of "Recreate
    Problem," and will be available for reuse from the Problem Resolution Report.
</p>
<h4>
    1&nbsp; Integration Group Definition
</h4>
<p>
    Programs that use the same data stores are grouped to form units, Integration Groups, that can be discretely tested to
    a high level.&nbsp; For instance, programs that create, modify, delete, and report on a particular record type form a
    good integration group.&nbsp; If possible, choose the integration groups so that a common logic module is in only one
    group.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    However, for maintenance on some legacy systems it may not always be possible for clean cut logical Integration Groups
    to be scoped.&nbsp; This is due primarily to the way that the system has been constructed where multiple modules access
    a small number of very large files.&nbsp; To then create meaningful Integration Groups would be to create Integration
    Groups that were almost the entire system.
</p>
<p>
    To help define an Integration Group's scope, reference should be made to the impact analysis that was performed in the
    Analyse System Components task.&nbsp; By reviewing such reports as where a data element (field) is used by a module it
    will be possible to build Integration Groups based on this analysis.
</p>
<p>
    The Integration Group dependency should now be established.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Complete the following steps using the database prepared in the Construct Database subtask.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Prepare Data - To test a module, prepare both JCL and test data.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare Test Conditions - A rule that must be tested to ensure the correct operation of a procedure step, module,
        action statement or statement block.
    </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    [NOTE: if there are dates involved, consider the implications for 21st Century]
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    There are several types of conditions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Permitted Range Checks are test conditions on whether or not a value falls within a defined range.&nbsp; Values
        outside the range must be rejected.&nbsp; A test case is developed for valid, invalid, null and boundary
        values.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Algorithms and Computations are test conditions to check correct functioning of algorithms.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Integrity Conditions are test conditions to ensure that integrity rules are correctly applied on database
        updates.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Existence Checks are attempts made to retrieve records that should exist and others that should not exist.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The information recorded for a test condition is the procedure/step/action statement/statement block to be validated,
    and the rule to be tested.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the statement block or program/module associated with the control condition "month less than 13" results
    in two test conditions whose rules are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If MONTH less than 13 then valid path taken<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If MONTH not less than 13 then invalid path taken
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note, it may be possible to be more specific about what a valid or invalid path is.&nbsp; No test data values are
    specified here.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare Test Case – For each test condition, prepare a test case consisting of input data and anticipated
    results.&nbsp; A comparison of anticipated and actual test results will show if the result is correct or erroneous.
</p>
<p>
    Errors will normally require individual test cases.&nbsp; Whenever possible, verify several correct test conditions in
    a single test case.
</p>
<p>
    4.&nbsp;Document Test Case – For each test case, document:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Test conditions that the test case is verifying<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Field values for input screens, documents, and records<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Initial database state<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Field values for output screens, reports, and records<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Resulting database state
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Test Cases are grouped into Test Cycles.
</p>
<p>
    5.&nbsp;Prepare Test Cycle
</p>
<p>
    A test cycle is a collection of test cases that are applied in sequence to verify the correct operation of all the test
    conditions tested by the test cases.&nbsp; It may be performed as a practical on-line testing session, a batch test run
    or an entirely clerical trial procedure.&nbsp; The test cases are applied in sequence within a test cycle.
</p>
<p>
    In general, the test data for a test cycle will consist of an initial database, input data for each test case,
    anticipated results for each test case and a final database of expected results.
</p>
<p>
    For each test case, all activities of the tester are recorded.&nbsp; Input data consist of the activities required,
    together with values for the fields that must be entered.&nbsp; This assumes that the database, files and screens have
    results based on the previous test cases.
</p>
<p>
    The anticipated results, documented in the test plan, must be detailed enough to show the specific results that are to
    be validated by testing.&nbsp; If multiple test cases have been developed for a test condition, the test cases may
    belong to different test cycles and may be documented accordingly.&nbsp; The final test case in a test cycle must
    provide a full description of the anticipated database.
</p>
<p>
    The Integration Test Cycle dependency should now be established.
</p>
<p>
    6.&nbsp;Define Database State – The formats of the test data will vary, for example, with modification to the test
    database, dialogue inputs, or inputs to a dialogue simulator.&nbsp; Rather than define the initial database state and
    the resulting database state for each test case, it may be easier to do it once for the entire test cycle.
</p>
<p>
    7.&nbsp;Define Test Data – If a module is not involved in integration testing, it is not necessary to define test data
    for that module.&nbsp; The module will be tested when its calling module is tested.
</p>
<p>
    8.&nbsp;Sample Integration Tests
</p>
<p>
    9.&nbsp;Permitted Range Checks – Test conditions to check acceptance of a value within a range and rejection of values
    outside a range must be derived.&nbsp; A field shall be tested for valid, invalid, null and boundary values.
</p>
<p>
    10.&nbsp;Algorithm and Computation – Test conditions to check the correct functioning of algorithms must be derived.
</p>
<p>
    11.&nbsp;Integrity Rule – Test conditions to ensure that integrity rules are correctly applied must be derived,
    particularly on database updates.
</p>
<p>
    12.&nbsp;Existence Checks – Attempts must be made to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Retrieve records that should exist and others that should not exist<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Store records with duplicate keys , including both valid and invalid instances
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    13.&nbsp;Edit Function – Certain fields (e.g., dates) are likely to be stored in a different format from the one in
    which they are displayed.&nbsp; Test conditions must be established to ensure that this works, perhaps using white-box
    techniques.
</p>
<p>
    14.&nbsp;Input-Output – Test conditions are required to ensure that records are created, updated and deleted.&nbsp;
    This can usually be performed by multiple test cycles that use the black-box method.&nbsp; Test conditions must also be
    created to ensure the working of basic database functions, such as the attempted creation of duplicate key records, the
    retrieval of non-existent records, and the changing and deletion of key fields.
</p>
<p>
    15.&nbsp;Output Formatting – Processing related to the arrangement of information on a screen or report must be
    checked.&nbsp; A higher-level test must take data from being input on a screen to being printed on a report.
</p>
<p>
    16.&nbsp;Audit Trails – Any internal checks, such as record counts and access constraints, should be tested.
</p>
<p>
    17.&nbsp;Security Violation – Test conditions shall be derived to attempt to violate security.
</p>
<p>
    18.&nbsp;Error Handling – Conditions should be established to identify and report expected (e.g., user-created) and
    unexpected, system-failure-created (e.g., database-call) errors.
</p>
<p>
    19.&nbsp;Regression Test – This is a test that ensures that no new errors have been introduced into existing
    modules/integration group.
