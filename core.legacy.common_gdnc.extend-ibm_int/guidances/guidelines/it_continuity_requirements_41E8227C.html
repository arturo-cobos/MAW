    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    It also documents the implications of deviations from these requirements. The priority subset of applications are
    documented in addition to the subset of applications for which there is no continuity. The risks associated with no
    continuity are documented as well.
</p>
<p>
    Business value, associated costs, and information loss are important factors in determining the requirements.
</p>
<p>
    IT Continuity Requirements can be defined in many areas. The following are typical, although the actual requirements
    will depend on the scope of the engagement:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        centralized server
    </li>
    <li>
        distributed server
    </li>
    <li>
        storage
    </li>
    <li>
        facilities
    </li>
    <li>
        network
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Development Approach
</h3>
<p>
    To develop the IT continuity requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify critical applications based on contractility, identified loss to the customers of that application, and
        the implications to the business if this application were not restored within a reasonable (48 to 72 hours)
        time.&nbsp; To do this, conduct interviews and workshops with the client.&nbsp; Prioritize the applications in
        terms of which ones have the greatest impact to the business if they are unavailable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Work with the client during workshops or meetings to determine the cost versus value of IT continuity for critical
        applications.&nbsp; Many applications are deemed critical, such as payroll, but in fact, would generally not be
        catastrophic if the application were not running for an entire payroll cycle.&nbsp; The things must be considered
        before going to the next step.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the requirements and group them into logical categories.&nbsp;&nbsp; For each requirement, identify the
        need to restore this application due to a catastrophic outage and the time period in which the user can assess the
        applications.&nbsp; In many instances, another column next to the application would be if this requirement were
        legal as stated in a service level agreement.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Prioritize the requirements.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the requirements with the client and gain the client’s acceptance or agreement to the requirements,
        including costs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Advice and Guidance
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        IT continuity requirements are developed by the technology team, which consists of both the client and IBM Global
        Services representatives.&nbsp; Input is also gathered from the client's strategic direction for IT and originally
        by the client's customers.&nbsp; If the requirements are not known and requirements need to be put in place from
        the beginning, consider the time it will take and put a PCR in place to do the work.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Validation and verification is done with the client sponsor and IT client executives.&nbsp; The requirements should
        be previously documented by the client prior to the consulting engagement.&nbsp; A good way to validate the
        requirements would be to receive client approval on them and if they are not acceptable to have the costs available
        to meet the client’s requirements to ensure that the requirement outweighs the costs.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        This work normally takes 2-5 days to complete.&nbsp; It is done working with the client responsible for the
        existing business plan and also has SLA information by application regarding requirements.&nbsp; Information on how
        IT continuity is being performed today is generally used for what will be delivered in the future.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Summary:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Business Impact Analysis and Environment Analysis were used to validate the Client's chosen recovery strategy and
    configuration as well as identify additional recovery issues and concerns that should be addressed.&nbsp; In addition,
    the Clients first ever I/T Recovery Plan was developed and documented.&nbsp; This was an SP2 environment using SAP and
    included Intel servers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Issues:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Client was unfamiliar with recovery planning methodologies and the process for documenting a recovery plan.&nbsp;
    Client needed to be led through the process and tutored on the key issues.<br />
