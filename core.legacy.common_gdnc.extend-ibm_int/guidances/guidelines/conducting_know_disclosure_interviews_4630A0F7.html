<p>
    "Interviews" can be used as a disclosure technique at several phases within a Knowledge Management (KM) engagement:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In the initial phase when choosing a selection area for study, they would be used to identify:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Client communities to include in the project
            </li>
            <li>
                Appropriate client team and IBM team members
            </li>
            <li>
                Appropriate subject areas
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Throughout the engagement for anecdote elicitation
    </li>
    <li>
        During the disclosure phase of a KM engagement where questions would be asked around what Artifacts, Skills,
        Heuristics, Experience, Knowledge (ASHEN) are used at key disclosure points (KDPs) in order to build a Knowledge
        Asset register.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These are all now described in more detail:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interviews for Selection</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    These interviews may be coupled with ONA (Organizational Network Analysis) work, particularly in the selection of
    client team members, subject areas and communities for the story telling project.
</p>
<p>
    They precede the covenanting workshop (joint project team set up) and have a number of objectives.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To get a feel for what it’s like to work for company X – culture, philosophy, value/belief systems<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To obtain stakeholder buy in for the KM project from the outset<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To find advocates of the approach, volunteers who are well networked within the organization to participate in the
        joint client/IBM team<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To identify potential subjects for anecdote elicitation, through story circle, observation, interviews or anonymous
        virtual communities<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To identify communities, informal and formal to participate in the project<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To identify subject areas to study in the KM project<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To identify potential concerns, issues or objections to the project – focusing on enablers and blockers<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To get an initial feel for the type of knowledge that exists within the organization and how they are used<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To assess milestones and key events on a project if Lessons Learnt is the main objective, or gain an understanding
        of the day to day work of the department or group under study<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure consistent understanding of the Knowledge Project<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Manage expectations of the client – provide clear indication of scope, activities, deliverables and
        objectives&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        To identify IBM consultants who have an aptitude and enthusiasm for this type of work to build membership of the
        joint team
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Interviews for anecdote elicitation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The primary objective of an interview for anecdote elicitation is to glean rich experiential anecdotes from the
    interviewee. These anecdotes may be used to assess organizational culture, values, rules and belief systems. The focus
    of interviews conducted in the anecdote elicitation phase may vary depending upon the project objectives, but anecdotes
    are usually deconstructed into story elements, archetypes and assets, with a view to constructing teaching stories or
    forming an asset register. It is essential during this phase of the project to focus on collecting appropriate
    information in a well-structured, reusable format. Objectives include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Collection of true anecdotal experiences of individuals or communities for the community/subject areas studied –
        this material makes up the anecdotal base upon which the remainder of the KM project is founded.
    </li>
    <li>
        Capture of common language, catch phrases and collective experiences or shared beliefs that a community will relate
        to if portrayed in a teaching story.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of essential knowledge in a project, department or role – this includes all elements of the ASHEN
        model – this is especially important if an asset register is one of the major project deliverables.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of common values, rules or belief systems shared at the corporate, informal, or formal community
        level.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of Knowledge Disclosure Points, either within a project environment or in the daily work of a
        department or group – these include - decisions, judgements, insights, learning points, problem/issue resolution
        and solution construction.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of common archetypes within the environment under study.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Collection of story elements for story construction – these include context, initiating event, protagonist,
        formidable antagonist, goal, and empathy for the protagonist etc.&nbsp; When eliciting anecdotes, be mindful of the
        story element models that will be used for story construction.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Common organizational issues and problems are often uncovered during this phase of the project.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of key dependencies and relationships are uncovered through anecdote elicitation. It is useful to
        uncover any trusted relationships whether informal or formal through this work.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is important to bear in mind that it’s very rare to find an anecdote that can be used in isolation as a teaching
    story. It is most often necessary to merge anecdotes, archetypes, story elements, facts, values and rules to generate a
    compelling teaching story of sufficient strength to achieve the project objective.&nbsp; As you’re capturing anecdotes,
    encourage your interviewee to flesh out the story. Ask them about feelings, characters, facts, reactions, assets used,
    decisions, judgements made etc. If some anecdotes are lacking many of these elements, they should still be captured, as
    they will still be useful for story construction.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interviews for the Asset Register</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Anecdote elicitation will generate a large volume of information. This material is usually sufficient for story
    construction, but what we have found from experience is that further validation is required to generate a
    comprehensive, accurate and complete asset register. The purpose of interviews during this phase of a story engagement
    is to flesh out the asset register defined by the anecdote elicitation exercise. All members of the joint IBM/client
    team should be involved in this validation exercise and it is usual for the asset register to be built incrementally in
    an easily searchable electronic form. Objectives include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Generation of a concrete asset register listing assets that can be physically located, produced or updated
        throughout a project life cycle or in regular use by a community or individual.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Prioritization of key assets (using the ASHEN model) by community, project, process or strategy.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Documented use of assets by individuals or a community in the conduction of a process, implementation of a project
        or in the achievement of a strategy or goal.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Validation of the asset register by the broader client community.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Collection/corroboration of ideas for sharing, improving and deploying the assets held by a community.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Taking the first steps towards establishing a process for future asset generation and deployment.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    2&nbsp; Ethical Guidelines
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ask for permission - taping the interview is often the easiest way to capture the interview quickly and
        unobtrusively. But make sure you have the interviewee’s permission. Trust is an essential component of the
        technique.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Don’t influence the outcome - your task is to help the interviewee disclose their knowledge in the form of
        anecdotes and sometimes directly as KDP’s, and ASHEN. Don’t lead the witness!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make your interviewee comfortable - KM consultants need to be able to connect with a wide range of people at
        diverse cultural, intellectual and experiential levels. Find out a little about your interviewee before hand so you
        can converse in their language. Make an effort to be non-threatening, submissive, inquisitive and
        enthusiastic.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Be flexible – don’t take a prescriptive approach to interviewing. Different situations require different styles of
        interviewing and different questions. It is usually most appropriate to take an unstructured, discussion like
        approach to interviewing, conducted in a relaxed environment.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Be honest and open – your interviewee will need to know a little about the project. Provide a very brief outline
        and how their contribution will help. Take care not to focus on concrete goals. The project outcome &
        interventions will not be known until later in the project when a significant amount of disclosure has been
        undertaken.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Be interested and curious – people will open up more if you are interested in what they have to say, so be alert
        and curious. You are there to listen and absorb, but they will often need prompting to tell you more. Be
        inquisitive, build on the information they share with you. Ask follow on questions and encourage them to elaborate
        anecdotes further, identifying people, conflicts, learning points etc. ask them how they felt. Consider how you
        would you normally tease out this type of information if a friend was telling you a story.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Stress anonymity and confidentiality – talking about failures and lessons learnt can be a painful and sensitive
        subject for most people. Reassure your interviewee that their contribution will be treated with the utmost
        confidentiality; there will be no allocation of blame or backlashes.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3 General Principals
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Do…</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Look for areas on the borderline. Explore the points of pain for individuals; ask them for failure stories and hard
    lessons they learned from their own mistakes and those of others.&nbsp; Probe for times when things went wrong but were
    retrieved last minute, when they manage to achieve success over the odds, when all the cards were stacked against them.
    Look at occasions when they had near misses, when situations could have gone very wrong, consider why they didn’t and
    how was the problem resolved. Ask your interviewee about times when they had good luck and bad luck; you don’t have to
    focus entirely on the truth, you can explore fictional space. Think about the might have been, what could have made
    things go wrong, what could have made things go well.
</p>
<p>
    Take care to select a relaxed environment for your interview. It should be a location that your interviewee is familiar
    with and doesn’t feel threatened in. Ask them to help you choose a comfortable environment for their interview.
</p>
<p>
    Document their responses to your questions verbatim. Make a distinct note of their language and common phrases.
</p>
<p>
    Use an open discussion approach. We rarely have a list of interview questions pre-prepared, allow the discussion to
    unfold in a way that the interviewee feels comfortable with (as long as you’re achieving your objectives this is OK).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Don’t…</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Don’t be an authoritative consultant. Don’t preach or talk down to people. You’re there to absorb information and not
    to depart it.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t be prescriptive with your approach, if your interviewee takes the discussion in a different direction than you
    anticipated, don’t try to force them back on track to your logical, linear way of thinking. Be prepared to take an
    indirect route to disclosure.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t ask direct questions. Remember that knowledge is contextual. You only know what you know when you need to know
    it. It is far more effective to have someone explore an event in which they applied their knowledge than to ask a
    person directly “what do you know?”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interview Checklist&nbsp; (for anecdote elicitation)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Introduce yourself and give a brief explanation of the purpose of the interview
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Context</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Set the scene for the interview. Explain a little about the project, and their role within it.&nbsp; Give your
    interviewee an idea of the objective for the interview and the project. This will usually include informing them of
    other interviewees, story circles and observation being conducted. Keep it brief!&nbsp; Let them know you’re interested
    in their practical experiences and it is far more beneficial to the project if they are honest. They should tell things
    as they are, rather than how they think they should be. Make sure they’re comfortable about speaking in their own
    language, make sure they don’t formalize the interview, ask them to be themselves and reassure them that there’ll be no
    repercussions from this. Emphasize the human element of the work being undertaken, you may need to share with them some
    case studies where we’ve undertaken this type of work before. Emphasize the benefits; tell teaching stories if you can.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>About them and what they do</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Explore their work and contribution to the community or subject area under study. Understand where they fit in a
    project, who they work directly with and what communities they are part of. If possible, explore the trusted
    relationships they have.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Anecdote elicitation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Using the standard anecdote elicitation techniques provided you should spend the bulk of the interview in the pursuit
    of anecdotes. Note these down by scribing or capture with a Dictaphone if you have their permission.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Close down</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When your time is up, bring the interview to a close. Thank your interviewee for their time and contribution and
    provide an opportunity for them to ask questions of you. Indicate what happens next & how their contribution will
    be used.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interview write up</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Write up interview using the standard interview template provided. Post the interview as early as possible on the joint
    client team TeamRoom or workspace.
</p>
<p>
    Pass the interview notes to the analysis team for input into the anecdote repository.
</p>
<h3>
    4&nbsp; Recommended Anecdote Elicitation Techniques for Interview
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Explore your interviewee’s history, background and story with their current employer.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand what an apprentice would have to achieve to do their job, how long would the skills take to acquire,
        what type of experience would they need, what artifacts are available to support them. Make it personal if you can,
        take on the role of their apprentice – If you have time for observation.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them about high and low points on their project or in their daily work.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore pain and pleasure points – good moments, bad ones.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore mistakes they’ve made, lessons they’ve learnt, and problems they’ve solved in an innovative or successful
        way.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them what it feels like to work for company X. What common values or rules do they share with their colleagues?
        Are they well supported and respected in what they do? When has the company been there for them, when has it
        not.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What degree of trust exists within their community, explore who trusts who, what are the dependencies &
        relationships informal and formal that bind the team together?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore fictional space. What might have been, what used to be.&nbsp; Take them back to the good old days if you
        can. What’s changed for the better, what’s changed for the worse.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider times when it’s been difficult or easy to do their job.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them when there have been times they have enlisted the help of others, why did they need it, who were the
        others, what skills & experiences did they draw on. Explore these trusted relationships.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask about cyclic influences, weekly, monthly, yearly.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Be specific about lessons learnt. Explore the times when your interview learnt a lesson, whether through insight,
        training or a mistake of theirs or of another.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Find out about innovative solutions they’ve implemented or designed. Consider the associated assets.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask your interview to think about a recent problem they’ve experienced, or decision they’ve made. Consider the
        associated assets.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask the interview which people in the organization they’ve enjoyed working with and why.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them about serendipity – have they experienced any bad luck or good luck in their work?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them about stories they’ve recently told their friends and family about their work.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them to imagine they have a new apprentice. Ask what are the first things they’d have to learn to get started
        in their job.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask whether there are formal or informal opportunities for apprenticeship and mentoring within their organization.
        If they exist are individuals recognized and rewarded for participating in such activities.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them about the most difficult problem they’ve had to solve in their work. Do they do it alone, or do they ask
        for help? If so who do they call, what artifacts do they employ and how do they resolve it. What would they have
        done differently next time.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them if it’s common to find existing solutions they can reuse in their work and whether it’s easy to find and
        share knowledge in this way.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask them about the dragons laying in wait. What makes their work most difficult? What have been the obstacles in
        their path, hindering success. How have they overcome these.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Who do you respect and trust most in this organization and why. Is there an open trusting and sharing
        culture?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Tell me about a time when you helped others out of a difficult spot. How did you help. Is it common for this type
        of support and sharing to occur in your part of the organization?
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    5&nbsp; Tools
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Dictaphone</strong> – to record anecdotes. Make a note of anecdote titles and their location on the tape.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Notebook</strong> – You’ll be drawing inferences during the interview, use a double column notebook to record
    the key verbatim events of the interview alongside your inferences and preliminary analysis.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Video</strong> – it is rare you’ll have to resort to this, but it could be useful, especially if the language
    is difficult to understand or if there is a large volume of material to capture.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interview Template –</strong> You can aid the deconstruction process by recording the interview in a standard
    format using notations to do a preliminary analysis of the text.
