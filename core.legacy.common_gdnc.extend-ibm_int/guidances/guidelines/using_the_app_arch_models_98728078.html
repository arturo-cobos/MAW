    1&nbsp;Introduction
</h4>
<p>
    The paper also points out the consequences of each approach on the tailoring of the selected project engagement model,
    i.e. on the definition of the project’s work breakdown structure (WBS) and on the adoption of specific work products
    (WP’s) and as such will of great value during the Method Adoption Workshop.&nbsp; The focus is on&nbsp;how
    to&nbsp;organizine the work needed to develop the functional aspect of the IT System in the context of a application
    development project.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Background
</h3>
<p>
    The IBM Global Services Method (The Method) presents a rich set of engagement models and WPD’s in order to meet the
    requirements of an as wide as possible variety of IT system implementation projects. In all cases, The Method addresses
    the general problem of moving from requirements to implementation in two different ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        emphasizing the use of the ‘architecture model’ (subsequently referred to as ‘architecture model’ driven approach)
    </li>
    <li>
        relying on the use of the ‘application model’ (subsequently referred to as ‘application model’ driven approach)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The ‘architecture model’ construct refers to a group of WP’s related to the functional and operational aspect of the
    architecture, most notably the Component Model WP, Deployment Unit WP and Operational Model WP. The ‘application model’
    construct groups a number of analysis and design related WP’s either created in the context of a structured or an
    object-oriented approach, such as Program Module Specification WP and Class Diagram WP.
</p>
<p>
    The generalized WBS proposed for e.g. the CAD engagement models includes, however, activities both for the architecture
    and the application model driven approaches. Consequently, without careful tailoring of the engagement model, the
    resulting WBS and the set of adopted WP’s might cause unnecessary work and confusion.
</p>
<p>
    Understanding the scope and complexity of the IT system is fundamental to determining an appropriate tailoring of the
    engagement model for delivering that system. One key decision is whether the method work products of the application or
    architecture model should be the focus of effort during the early architecture and design tasks of the engagement. This
    clearly affects the type of roles needed and resource profiles. The Lead Architect will set such a direction for the
    project and advise the Project Manager about which approach should be followed in delivering the IT system.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the architecture and application model are not perfect substitutes for one another, since the development of
    the solution’s design will almost certainly need WPs from each model.&nbsp; However in both the architecture and the
    application model, WPs are present that support the definition of the high level structure of the IT System and
    consequently only one of them will be created during the definition of the functional aspect of the architecture. As
    will be shown later, the use of the architecture model driven approach does not exclude the use of the application
    model driven approach. The latter will still be used although only within the scope(s) defined by the components of the
    associated Component Model WP. Alternatively, the use of the application model driven approach will typically imply
    that some WPs associated with the architecture model driven approach will not be created. The WP’s associated with the
    operational aspect (Deployment Units WP and Operational Model WP) will always be relevant given that the WPD’s grouped
    in the application model do not address the operational aspect of the architecture.<br />
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Approaches for bridging the gap between requirements and implementation
</h3>
<p>
    A combination of WPs taken from both the architecture and application models is needed in order to support a complete
    end-to-end design and specification of the functional aspects of an IT system. However, the actual WP’s used and the
    emphasis laid on the various activities of the WBS differ substantially between the two approaches. This section will
    focus on the approaches themselves, while the next will take a closer look at the effect of adopting a particular
    approach on tailoring the engagement model.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In the architecture model driven approach, the WP’s covering the functional and the operational aspect of the
        architecture will be used to specify the overall structure of the system down to a sufficient level of detail. The
        ‘sufficient’ level of detail refers to the situation in which a well specified context has been created for all
        subsequent design and implementation level activities.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Typically, the application model related WP’s will then be used to drive the overall design of the system up to the
        point where the implementation activities can take place. Thus, in the architecture model driven approach, this
        design level activity will each time take place within the overall structure(s) defined by the work products
        belonging to the architecture model.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        The application model driven approach on the other hand will rely on a ‘high level’ version of the applicable
        design level WPs to drive out the overall software structure of the system, while the WP’s of the architecture
        model will be used to address the needs of the operational aspect of the architecture. This approach uses different
        work products (complying with the same work product description) addressing firstly the need to establish an
        overall structure, and subsequently documenting the design level detail needed to be able to move towards
        implementation.
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Thus, like the architecture model driven approach, a context is established within which the ‘design level’
        versions are created, in this case by the ‘high level’ version of the same work product description.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    4&nbsp;The Effect of the Approaches on Tailoring the Engagement Model
</h3>
<p>
    A key driver determining the choice between the ‘Architecture Model’ and the ‘Application Model’ approaches will be the
    scope and complexity of the IT system to be delivered. This complexity is assessed during the Solution Design phase
    (such as during the proposal development) and is one of the key inputs to the Method Adoption Workshop (MAW) conducted
    early in the Solution Delivery project. This workshop determines the activities and tasks that will be incorporated in
    the WBS and the WP’s that will be produced during the engagement. It is crucial to understand that the focus of effort,
    certainly during Solution Outline and Macro Design, will differ significantly depending on the approach chosen, (Ref.
    2):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In less complex engagements where the application model leads, no tasks related to the creation and refinement of
        the WP’s supporting the functional aspect of the architecture will be scheduled. For example, if the IT system is a
        simple client / server application consisting of a client application, some server stored procedures and associated
        database tables, then developing a high level component model will not provide more insight than the relevant
        design level work product.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />

            </p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        However, as the diagram above shows, certain WP’s belonging to the architecture model will still be created,
        notably the Operational Model WP - unless the system is also straightforward from an operational aspect’s point of
        view. Consequently, the way in which the information will flow between the WP’s of the architecture and application
        models will have to be defined during the tailoring of the engagement model as no such explicit linkage is
        currently defined within the Global Services Method.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        With a large and complex IT system, such as a distributed multi-technology system integration project, it will
        almost certainly be necessary to adopt an architecture model driven approach, although it may only possible to
        identify the required components at a very coarse level during Solution Outline (during the task ‘Develop High
        Level Component Model’). In such a system, additional effort will be required on the architecture model during
        Solution Delivery. This effort will be aimed at defining all required components and their interactions down to a
        sufficient level of detail so that a context can be provided for all subsequent design level activities. These
        design level activities will then typically create one or more of the work products grouped in the Application
        Model, defining for example system functions and logical data entities.<br />

<h3>
    5&nbsp;Step Wise Procedure to Ensure a Consistent Rollout of the Chosen Approach
</h3>
<p>
    Deciding on which approach to adopt, and how the chosen approach influences the development of the work products
    associated with the functional aspects of the project can be accomplished during the MAW (or similar event) by
    following a step-by-step procedure:
</p>
<h4>
    Step 1: Understand the scope and complexity of the IT system
</h4>
<p>
    Use the System Context diagram and Architecture Overview diagram WPs to understand the scope and complexity of the
    solution that has to be delivered. These will probably have been created as part of Solution Design; although they
    should be refined as you start Solution Delivery:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The System Context diagram will highlight the various involved user groups and external interfaces and therefore
        provide an indication of the scale and complexity of the IT system. A small-scale or simple system will only have a
        very limited number of external systems and only a limited number of user groups.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Architecture Overview diagram will give an overview of the solution to be delivered. On the basis of this
        overview, an initial assessment can be made of the relative complexity of the solution. A simple system will only
        consist of a single application while a more complex one may involve several different applications offering
        opportunities for e.g. the development of common technical services.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 2: Select an approach
</h4>
<p>
    Decide on the approach given the degree of complexity and the scope identified during the previous step. For complex IT
    Systems we would recommend the adoption of the architecture model driven approach given the advantages obtained through
    the creation of a Component Model WP (such as the definition of an overall functional structure of the system
    emphasizing the definition of cohesive and decoupled components (See Ref 3)). Also, even when the system is
    straightforward from the functional aspect’s point of view, one might want to consider adopting the architecture model
    driven approach for the better linkage it supports between the Component and Operational Model.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3: Adopt the appropriate work products to organize the development of the functional aspect of the architecture of
    the IT system
</h4>
<p>
    In the architecture model driven approach, the Component Model is the key work product for specifying the functional
    architecture of an IT system. Hereto a number of techniques are available for identifying and specifying the components
    of the IT system (Ref. 3 & 4). This might be the case for a large new system integration effort e.g. a
    multi-channel CRM solution or leading-edge technology projects where component blueprints and best practices do not
    exist.
</p>
<p>
    In an application driven approach, the key WP depends on the adopted software development style:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        where a Structured Analysis and Design development method is used, the key work product will be the Program Module
        Invocation Model, defining how various applications and code modules collaborate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Alternatively, Object-oriented development methods will rely on the Class Diagram and Interaction Diagram work
        products to document the structures and collaborations of the identified classes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Step 4: Ensure that only the activities relevant for one of the approaches are present in the WBS
</h4>
<p>
    In the case of the architecture model driven approach, remove tasks that outline or refine the high level application
    model. In this approach, that role is assumed by the Component Model WP.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, in the case of the application driven approach, all tasks related to outlining or refining the component
    model should be removed from the WBS. In this approach, that role is assumed by the ‘high level version’ of the
    appropriate Application Model related WP.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 5: Ensure that the relevant architecture and application model related WP’s are joined up
</h4>
<p>
    In the case of the architecture model driven approach, a decision needs to be taken about whether the components
    specified in the component model WP will be implemented following a structured or an object oriented approach. This
    decision will lead to the adoption of the relevant application model related WP. This WP will take the component
    specification as its starting point.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, in the case of the application model driven approach, the linkage between the high level and the design
    level of the adopted WP needs to be established so that a seamless integration between both levels is obtained.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 6: Ensure the linkage between the functional and operational aspects of the architecture
</h4>
<p>
    The operational aspect of the architecture of the IT system (mainly documented in the Operational Model WP) is usually
    developed in parallel to the functional aspect of the IT system. The Deployment Unit work product is used to bridge
    between the functional and operational sides of the solution.
</p>
<p>
    If the architecture driven approach is adopted, the WBS and the technique papers associated with the Component and
    Operational Model WP’s together with the DU development technique paper will ensure that both aspects are linked up and
    synchronized regularly during the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of the application driven approach, the link between the functional and operational aspects of the solution
    is also via the identification and definition of appropriate DUs – but this time associated with the DFD Application
    Model (Execution DU) and Physical Database Model WP (Data DU) for the structured approach or with the Interaction
    Diagram WP (Execution DU) and Class Diagram WP (Data DU) for the object oriented approach. There are not, however,
    technique papers yet available within The Method to support this linkage.
</p>
<h3>
    6&nbsp;Appendix : The WPD’s of the Application Model
</h3>
<p>
    The application model groups the WP’s documenting the design of software in an IT system through object-oriented
    analysis and design techniques or structured analysis and design techniques. This is captured in a number of work
    products, some of which are classified as either “structured” or “object-oriented”.
</p>
<p>
    On a large complex engagement there are likely to be both types. Some applications of the IT system will be designed
    and implemented using an OO method, whilst others will be designed and implemented using a structured method because
    they are going to be custom built using non-OO technology or result in a package based implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the application model does not include any WPs associated with the operational aspects of the solution.&nbsp;
    Consequently, projects adopting the application model approach will need to also adopt WPs from the operational aspects
    of the architecture model group. Also, no requirements WP’s are included in the overview, given that this appendix only
    includes those WP’s that are of immediate concern to this technique paper. Obviously, this does not imply that no
    requirements related WP’s should be adopted.
</p>
<h4>
    Work Products
</h4>
<p>
    The <em>object-oriented</em> analysis and design work products in the application model are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Class Diagram</strong> – represents the application model as a number of software objects and their static
        relationships.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interaction Diagram</strong> – depict the internal behaviour of the system through collaborating objects
        that send messages and return responses to each other.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Statechart Diagram</strong> – depicts the behaviour of a single class by describing the states it may
        attain and how external stimuli cause a change in state.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The <em>structured</em> analysis and design work products in the application model are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Database Transaction Descriptions</strong> – defines database operations into a set of transactions that
        will ensure data integrity and enforce business rules.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Logical Data Model –</strong> a diagram showing the relationship of entities, and their attributes, that
        represent the information that the IT system must manage.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Process Data Usage</strong> – defines all the dependency relationships between business processes and data
        entities.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Program Invocation Model</strong> – describes the calling hierarchy of the IT system’s application mapping
        the functional model onto code modules.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Program Module Specifications</strong> – specifies the interface and function of code modules.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>DFD Application Model</strong> – a functional decomposition of the IT system.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Activities
</h4>
<p>
    The development of the application model is done through three key activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Outline Application Model</strong> – defines the major pieces of function (either classes or entities /
        processes) and their relationships independent of implementation.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Refine Application Model</strong> – user specifications, business process definitions and business
        requirements refine the system-wide information needed to specify software releases.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Detail Application Model</strong> – detail the specification of part of the system for a release.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    7&nbsp;Appendix: The WPD’s of the Architecture Model
</h3>
<p>
    The architecture model groups the WP’s documenting the functional and operational aspect of the architecture of the IT
    system in order to meet the business requirements and satisfy the non-functional requirements. This is captured in a
    number of work products, some of which are classified as either “functional” or “operational”.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the WPs associated with the operational aspects of the IT system’s architecture will also need to be adopted
    when using the application model.
</p>
<p>
    There are also some architecture work products for specialist architecture disciplines such as networking and
    performance engineering.
</p>
<p>
    Also, no requirements WP’s are included in the overview, given that this appendix only includes those WP’s that are of
    immediate concern to this technique paper. Obviously, this does not imply that no requirements related WP’s should be
    adopted.
</p>
<h4>
    Work Products
</h4>
<p>
    The key functional architecture work products in the architecture model are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Architectural Template</strong> – documents the common design patterns or technical implementation
        solutions for certain aspects of the solution such as persistence management.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Component Model –</strong> describes the structure of an IT system in terms of components and their
        responsibilities, interfaces, static relationships, and the way they collaborate to deliver the required
        functionality.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The key operational architecture work products in the architecture model are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Deployment Unit</strong> – describes components and data that are grouped together for deployment on
        nodes.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Operational Model</strong> – defines the distribution of an IT system’s components onto geographically
        distributed nodes and connections.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Activities
</h4>
<p>
    The development of the application model is done through three key activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Outline Architecture Model</strong> – define the overall shape and style of the architecture for the IT
        system, system-wide technology and design decisions, and asset assessment and selection.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Design Architecture Model</strong> – design the architecture of the overall IT system to be robust and
        flexible for all its releases, selecting infrastructure and application development products.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Refine Architecture Model</strong> – finalise the architecture required for a particular release that will
        support that release’s functional and non-functional requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
