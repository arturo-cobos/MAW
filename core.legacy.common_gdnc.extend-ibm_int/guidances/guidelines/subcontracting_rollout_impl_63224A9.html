    1&nbsp;Description
</h4>
<p>
    This technique paper covers the definition and documentation of the Subcontracting process for a rollout
    implementation. Every effort has been made to list the essential activities for a smooth acquisition of a
    subcontractor, both internal and external. The main focus is defining the skill requirements and choosing, according to
    certain criteria, what the best source is for those requirements and to fulfill them through the subcontracting
    processes.
</p>
<p>
    There are two types of subcontracting which may be required, either through internal IBM organizations or external
    suppliers. The selection of internal vs. external subcontractors will depend on a variety of factors, and in many cases
    will depend on what resources were designated during the solution design phase, and may be restricted by what costing
    was used in the GPE (Gross Profit Estimator Pricing tool for ITS).
</p>
<h4>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of this technique paper is to provide decision criteria for subcontracting choices and a clearly defined
    process to follow once that decision is made.&nbsp;

    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    3.1 Skills required for Rollouts
</h4>
<p>
    The skills required for rollout projects include the performance and coordination of all aspects and activities of the
    customer's workstation rollout.&nbsp; The aspects of a workstation rollout consist of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Plan the customization, installation and implementation of the workstation rollout which may include conversion,
        testing, and integration
        activities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Manage and coordinate all facets of hardware and software procurement and licensing registration
        activities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Management and coordination of hardware and software inventories and warranties, as well as tracking assets&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide reports for authorized personnel&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepare rollout plans and status reports
    </li>
    <li>
        Schedule and coordinate supplier and subcontractor management&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Asset tracking and reporting
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When sourcing subcontractors to supplement or deliver parts of a rollout project there are specific skill sets that
    need to be identified and sought from the perform resource.&nbsp;&nbsp; The skills specific to certain roles in the
    project may include the following:
</p>
<p>
    <u>Project Management knowledge</u> – specific to rollouts, scheduling, repeatable processes, Tier 1 education or
    equivalent experience.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Technical Skills –</u> specific to rollouts
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Installation Field Force&nbsp; - pc/retail/banking skills – documentation, testing, asset tracking, customer facing
        interpersonal skills
    </li>
    <li>
        Configuration Facility personnel – documentation, testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Cabling: RCDD or RCDD/LAN, Knowledge or Certification
    </li>
    <li>
        Hardware: A+ Knowledge or Certification
    </li>
    <li>
        Software: MCSE Knowledge or Certification (Microsoft Windows deployments)&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical Writing: Scripts, Directions, Processes, and Procedures
    </li>
    <li>
        Problem Determination
    </li>
    <li>
        Networking Knowledge: Basic Networking Concepts
    </li>
</ul>

    3.2&nbsp;&nbsp; Decision criteria for IBM vs. Non-IBM Resources
</h4>
<p>
    Sourcing of resources selection criteria – IBM Internal vs. External
</p>
<h5>
    3.2.1 IBM Internal Sourcing
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        As a general rule in ITS, the sourcing of external technical resources has been restricted.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        “Outside services, such as consultants, are not to be used. Any exceptions must be reviewed by Mike Wiley, general
        manager, and also approved by Robert Delbene, vice president, Finance & Procurement, IBM Global Services.
        Internal services, such as IBM consultants, advertising, graphics services, etc. should be minimized. Contractor
        usage should be significantly limited and only used for critical business requirements. All services subcontractor
        requests, except remotely delivered services&nbsp; (RDS) and technical deployment services (TDS), must be approved
        by Meg Kaminski, ITS finance and planning manager. The maintenance, TDS and RDS Resource Request process, which
        addresses subcontractor requests, as well as hires/transfers, requires the approval of Scott Dougall, vice
        president, technical support executive and Mark McConville, director of finance. Contractors should be used for
        billable engagements only after internal resources (ITS, Business Innovation Services and Strategic Outsourcing)
        have been considered. As a reminder, the hiring of consultants for non-billable engagements requires ITS general
        manager approval prior to any commitment. “(Taken from an e-mail sent by Adrian Barkan, Manager, Business Process
        Compliance, ITS Americas – 3/25/2002)
    </p>

<h5 dir="ltr">
    3.2.2 &nbsp;External Sourcing:
</h5>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        <div>
            Stipulated in the SOW – In some cases the basis of the resource selection is due to the signed SOW with the
            client. There may be a designated vendor that the client and IBM have agreed to use for their technical
            resources.&nbsp; In this case, the selection has already been made and the PM needs to follow what is
            stipulated in the signed SOW.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Stipulated in the pricing structure – When receiving a signed SOW for delivery, the solution design team has
            already structured the delivery of the project using specific resources.&nbsp; If they have included an
            external vendor in the solution and the deal they will already have received a quote from the vendor, and used
            this costing to price the solution.&nbsp; The same goes for an internal IBM resource.&nbsp; The solution design
            team will have already received a quote from the perform organization and will have used this to price the
            solution to the customer.&nbsp; In this case, it is likely that the PM will deliver the solution according to
            the budgeted model that has been structured.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            In some cases it may be necessary for the PM to change this model, possibly due to changes in scope, or the
            ability of the designated perform group to provide the necessary resources at the time they are needed.&nbsp;
            If the PM needs to look for resources elsewhere, the costing model, skill set and structure should be used as
            guidelines.&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Management Discretion – There are restrictions within IBM at present limiting or barring the use of certain
            technical resources.&nbsp; If there is a special need, there is a process, documented above, which the PM can
            invoke to bypass the restrictions, and source the resources externally if approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Unique skill set – The required skills may not be available within IBM, could be lacking altogether or may not
            be readily available; they may be an OEM product specific skill that IBM does have, or there may be a shortage
            of a specific skill which may need to be supplemented externally.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    3.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Sourcing Processes
</h4>
<h5>
    3.3.1 Internal process
</h5>
<p>
    To acquire an internal resource, a request form must be submitted to the Resource Deployment Manager (RDM) of the
    perform organization.&nbsp; The completed form should include all the resource requirements and provide the RDM with an
    overview of the project.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div>
            To begin the RDM Process, a Staff Request Form (resource request - see next section for form) is
            required.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>
                    The form should be completed by the requestor and sent to the RDM for processing.&nbsp; If the
                    requester does not have access to Lotus Notes and needs a resource, the information contained in the
                    Staff Request Form can be given to the RDM over the phone. &nbsp;
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Providing accurate information and detail on the Staffing Request Form is crucial for the RDM in
                    locating the right resource for the project.&nbsp; Information contained in the Staffing Request Form
                    (resource request) is used to build both internal resource requests and external (if indicated on form)
                    subcontractor requests.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    Once a Staff Request Form is received by your RDM, the RDM will verify the status of the opportunity
                    (contract signature, marketing assistance needed by perform resource,...etc).
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Perform resources will only be assigned to signed contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a resource can be put on
            "hold" for a contract that is not signed for up to one week.&nbsp; If another contract is signed and the
            resource on hold is needed for that contract, the RDM will check with the principal that put the resource on
            hold.&nbsp; Representative resumes can be provided for contracts/RFP responses that are not signed but these
            are representative of the type of resources/skills IBM can provide.&nbsp; This does not guarantee, nor commit a
            resource to a project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            If a contract is signed, the RDM will review the local bench and/or the National Availability Database for
            available resources within the practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a resource within the practice is available and the
            skills match, the resource will be assigned to the project.&nbsp; If a resume is requested, the RDM will send
            resume to requester.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an interview is required and a resource is then selected,&nbsp; the
            requestor must contact&nbsp; the RDM to confirm availability of that resource.&nbsp; Be aware that the RDM may
            have submitted the candidate on several opportunities.&nbsp; It is not safe to assume the resource is still
            available without checking with the RDM.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            If a resource within the practice is not available or there is no skill match (and the customer is willing to
            pay T&L), the RDM will enter the Resource Request in the National Staffing Database.&nbsp; This request
            will be sent to all RDM's across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resumes will be sent to the RDM and the requestor of
            the resource.&nbsp;&nbsp; The requestor will then review resumes and interview candidates, if a match is found
            the requestor must notify their RDM to confirm availability. The RDM requesting the resource will call the
            lending RDM and confirm the availability of the selected resource.&nbsp; If available, resource will be
            assigned to the project.&nbsp; If there are no resources available nationally with the skill requested and the
            customer has agreed that subcontractors can be used, then the RDM will send the resource request form to the
            appropriate Vendor RDM to send out to subcontractors/vendors.&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            If the customer will not pay T&L (travel & living) expenses, the RDM will still send the resource
            request out nationally to see if there are any local resources from other practices that can handle the
            resource request.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resumes will be sent to the RDM and the requestor of the resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The requestor will then review resumes and interview candidates, if a match is found the requestor must notify
            their RDM to confirm availability. The RDM requesting the resource will call the lending RDM and confirm the
            availability of the selected resource.&nbsp; If available, resource will be assigned to the project.&nbsp; If
            there are no resources available nationally with the skill requested and the customer has agreed that
            subcontractors can be used,, then the RDM will send the resource request form to the appropriate Vendor RDM to
            send out to subcontractors/vendors.&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            When an RDM deploys a resource to a project in another IBM Division or department, the requesting RDM will
            start a Document of Understanding (DOU) request and send completed DOU to lending RDM to approve.&nbsp; The
            lending RDM will have the DOU reviewed by the perform resource and/or principal for agreement.&nbsp; Their must
            be an agreement before the perform resource can start the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Resource Requests are closed in the Staffing Request Database when a resource is assigned, a vendor is
            assigned, or there are no resources that match the skill requested.&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<h5>
    3.3.2. External process – ReqCat – skill form to fill out
</h5>
<p>
    The method of procuring Technical Subcontracting Services involves a combination of Req/Cat Web and the Skills Matching
    Application (SMA). The Skills Matching Application was designed to standardize the Resource Request Form (RRF) and to
    provide direct communication with our Core Suppliers using the Internet.
</p>
<p>
    From Req/Cat Web you will access SMA where you will submit your requirements for qualified candidates. These
    requirements will be distributed to IBMs national venders via the internet. Even if you already have a candidate in
    mind, you must submit a request to the supplier as describe here. Suppliers will respond to your requirements by
    submitting qualified candidates to SMA (via the internet). You will then review this information and select make a
    selection. When you have made your selection, you will submit your choice back to Req/Cat Web. You will then complete,
    and submit your requisition after providing accounting information. After the requisition completes the approval
    process, a purchase order will be issued.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: Technical subcontracting requisitions are a two step process.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a first time user of the Skills Matching Application (SMA) - You will need to create a profile for the SMA
    application. To ensure that you receive an email notifying you that a supplier has responded, be sure to enter your
    email address in your SMA profile.
</p>
<p>
    Initiating a request for a candidate
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In order to access the SMA, you will first need to log onto Req/Cat Web (RCW).
    </li>
    <li>
        Create requisitions
    </li>
    <li>
        New...(No need to change requester or to external at this time unless you will be using submit type 3..Non-National
        supplier or Non-matrix pricing)

    </li>
    <li>
        Record the SMA request number. This is the number that the supplier will use to identify your request.
    </li>
    <li>
        After submitting your request to the supplier, you must now wait until the supplier responds before you can proceed
        to the next step. This is only true if you are not using submit type 3..Non-National supplier or Non-matrix
        pricing.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        You will receive an email notifying you that a supplier has responded. (You will only receive emails if your email
        address is in your SMA profile)<br />
        NOTE - It takes 2-6 hours for your request to get through the intranet firewall and reach the supplier. The same is
        true for the response from the supplier.
