    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    This Technique Paper covers the definition and documentation of the Post Go-Live Package Support Strategy, listing the
    activities required for implementation. This strategy can include the support during system upgrade, but also the
    handling of business issues that were not solved before cut-over, i.e. it is an extension to the original
    implementation engagement.
</p>
<p>
    This work product is generic and aims to list all the activities that should be performed, there may be implementations
    where some activities are not relevant, and may be excluded. The size of the project and the needs of the Client will
    determine the duration of each task. These however should be determined very early on in the project.
</p>
<h3>
    General Guidance
</h3>
<h4>
    Purpose
</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of this technique is to ensure that the Client has the ability to use and adapt to the system to meet their
    changing needs and ensure day-to-day efficient running of the business.
</p>
<p>
    This technique analyzes and documents the strategy for Post Go-Live package support: what the needs are, and what the
    options are for using internal/external resources or a combination to cover the support.
</p>
<h4>
    Impact of Not Using This Technique
</h4>
<p>
    An analysis of the Client's post live support needs/requirements will not be done, and a package support strategy
    cannot be put in place to cover these. This may influence the continued smooth running of the Clientâ€™s day-to-day
    business.
</p>
<h4>
    Reasons for Not Using This Technique
</h4>
<p>
    This work product is not needed if the Client has a tailored support strategy in place already.
</p>
<h4>
    Development Approach
</h4>
<p>
    Input to this work product:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The "Change Control Strategy" white paper.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The "Environment Strategy" white paper.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The "Change Request Log".
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Output from the work product:
</p>
<p>
    The "Post Go-Live Support Strategy" white paper.
</p>
<p>
    The following tasks are performed:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Investigate the Post Go-Live Support requirements and options, using a Service Requirements Questionnaire.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the Client's resourcing requirements, e.g. external or internal, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the Post Go-Live Support Strategy.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Post Live Support Strategy Options
</h3>
<p>
    The following will first outline Package Support Strategy options showing the benefits and risks associated with each.
    Secondly, in a very generic form the necessary steps to achieve the solution outlined. To ensure client satisfaction
    each option must be discussed and researched thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
    A number of options are open to a client to provide support in solving the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Correct problems causing system downtime<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Correct problems causing slow response times<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make additional changes or additions to the configuration tables<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Assisting users with problems or logging bugs<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Make the necessary adjustments to the system<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Smaller add-on projects, which had been considered as "nice to have" during the implementation project<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Expansions to the package solution<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Basis maintenance of the system<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Network maintenance and hardware faults
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The support options are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Local in-house Key User or Super User support<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Local package competence center<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Central package competence center<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Third party support&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A combination of Third Party support and Internal resource support
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    1.&nbsp;Local in-house Key User and Super User Support
</h4>
<p>
    Package support provided by Key or Super Users situated within the business. Personnel should have been involved in the
    initial implementation or have been subsequently trained in specific module functionality and configuration. Resources
    in both application and technical areas would be required, splitting their work between Post Live support and their
    normal tasks.
</p>
<p>
    Benefits
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Low dependency on third parties<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Costs are kept in-house<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Key or Super Users will have knowledge of the business and business requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Risks
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Service levels difficult to define and manage due to demands of other duties.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        High costs associated with Package Training which is required in order to keep updated in the functionality of
        future releases, staff turnover etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Staff retention difficulties due to high demand for Package skills.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Dependant on the number of sites, well thought out procedures for change management and authority will be required
        to maintain control over the configuration.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Package skills command high salaries.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2.&nbsp;Local package competence center
</h4>
<p>
    This has many similarities to local key in-house user maintenance, but uses dedicated resources rather than people
    within the business.
</p>
<p>
    Benefits
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Good basis for skills retention and development<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduced demand on business resources during the implementation phase<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Low demand on business resources post go-live<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Service levels can be retained due to dedicated service. How these are measured and ensured through an internal
        service needs to be considered
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Risks
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        High costs associated with Package Training which is required in order to keep updated in the functionality of
        future releases, staff turnover etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Staff retention difficulties due to high demand for Package skills.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Dependent on the number of sites, control over changes to be implemented on the system, may require strict
        authority and procedural consideration in order to maintain control.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Package skills command high salaries.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    3.&nbsp;Central package competence center
</h4>
<p>
    This is a dedicated resource giving support for all sites or regional areas of sites.
</p>
<p>
    Benefits
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Centralized control<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduced overall costs
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Risks
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Dependent on the locality of the sites, Support may be required outside of the normal hours of business for the
        Competency Center location.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Resource consideration<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cost implication of shift/ overtime<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Staff retention<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Language requirements making the combined skills of standard package and languages difficult to find and retain.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    4.&nbsp;Third party support
</h4>
<p>
    Benefits
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        No in-house resource requirements<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        No need to train and develop in-house skills<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Third party support can be either centralized or localized<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Minimizes issue of staff retention<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Contracted service levels<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Breadth of knowledge
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Risks
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Less control<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Loss of internal knowledge
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    5.&nbsp;Combination of Third Party Support and Internal Resource Support
</h4>
<p>
    The balance between internal and external support should be determined by weighing up a number of factors e.g.:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Is there sufficient internal Package knowledge<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the company compete with the external Package market<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the company focus: Business vs. Technical<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the company make internal support cost effective&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This combination can exist for many reasons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        External support for back-up during holidays and sickness<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Internal support with expert external support
    </li>
    <li>
        Super User internal support with external support for difficult issues and configuration requests.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The benefits of, such a combination:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ability to keep a level of internal knowledge balanced with the risk of resource retention problems associated with
        higher skilled Package personnel.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Expert back-up available when staff shortages occur due to retention or sickness, etc.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Expert back up in Disaster recovery situations and situations affecting the day-to-day running of the business.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Based on an analysis of the above the company must make the appropriate decision/s.&nbsp; In order to assist decision
    making, consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Logistics Considerations 
        <ul>
