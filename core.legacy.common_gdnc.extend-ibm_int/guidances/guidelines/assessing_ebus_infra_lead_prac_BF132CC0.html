    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    This paper describes a technique for assessing an existing n-tiered e-business infrastructure by comparing it to
    established leading practices. This assessment will be completed through the use of a matrix containing infrastructure
    design guiding principles and associated business impacts, and by examining the corresponding attributes of the
    client’s existing e-business infrastructure.
</p>The guiding principles are best of breed design points or leading practices for e-business infrastructure design. They
include design considerations for redundancy, scalability, and potential performance bottlenecks. These leading design
practices provide a benchmark against which the client’s existing infrastructure can be compared. The assessment
conclusions are developed by identifying where the client’s infrastructure or design practices deviate from the leading
practices and by determining the impact of those deviations. The existing infrastructure may also be compared against the
underlying n-tiered reference architecture to identify any significant differences in the functionality provided or in the
placement and distribution of function and data. 
<p>
    The guiding principles matrix and reference architecture are to be used as a reference for the overall assessment and
    are not intended to be used as the sole data-gathering tool. They should be utilized as part of the entire assessment
    process providing high level guidance for critical design points across an n-tiered environment. They will augment
    interview questions and help to segment the infrastructure into logical tiers for assessment.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    This assessment technique can be applied as part of an e-business infrastructure assessment engagement or at the
    beginning of a larger e-business design engagement in order to understand the potential infrastructure issues that may
    need to be addressed by the design.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    This technique is focused on the assessment of e-business technical infrastructure.&nbsp; In many instances it will be
    conducted as part of a broader assessment of the client’s e-business readiness, so will be performed in parallel with a
    corresponding assessment of the client’s e-business infrastructure management processes and organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The guiding principles or leading design practices are derived from the four-tiered e-business infrastructure reference
    design generally used in conjunction with the Rapid Infrastructure Design engagement model.&nbsp; However, this
    technique is also applicable in many other circumstances where an existing e-business technical infrastructure needs to
    be assessed.
</p>
<p>
    This paper provides a rapid e-business infrastructure assessment technique by which the engagement team can quickly
    compare the current infrastructure against the best practices design points in each tier.&nbsp; There are several
    reasons why this technique was developed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The typical e-business infrastructure assessment is typically very short in duration (4-6 weeks maximum) and
        performed by a small team.&nbsp; Many e-business clients need recommendations provided quickly to deploy tactical
        fixes within the environment.&nbsp; Because of this, the guiding principles were created to highlight common high
        availability design points that engagement teams can reference and thereby provide “quick hits”, or recommendations
        that can be easily deployed having a high impact on reliability.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The use of these leading practices and guiding principles also provides a common starting point and reference
        architecture for architects with various levels of e-business experience.&nbsp; It also assists in segmenting the
        client infrastructure into logical tiers, which facilitates the assessment process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Lastly, it helps to provide a more objective assessment approach that will help improve the consistency of e-business
    infrastructure assessment.&nbsp; By doing so, it reduces the experience required to perform an initial assessment,
    reduces the dependency on highly skilled individuals to perform the assessment, and helps eliminate some of the
    subjectivity inherent in less structured assessment techniques.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    3.1&nbsp; Review Statement of Work
</h4>
<p>
    The first step is to review the SOW to ensure the infrastructure matrix is a fit for the engagement being executed
    based on the hours in the contract, the resources, and the detail required by the client.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Do the guiding principles cover the detail required by the SOW?&nbsp; The client may be looking for very specific
        design issues based on past problems that may not be covered by the guiding principles.&nbsp; The key is to
        understand the level of detail required by the client and the additional assessment questions required.&nbsp;
        Again, this guide is meant to be a reference providing a platform for additional data gathering and segmenting the
        environment into logical tiers.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Is there enough time to execute this?&nbsp; For a 4-tiered environment the engagement team may need to interview a
        wide variety of client staff members varying from the telecommunications groups, security, database, and legacy
        systems.&nbsp; If the data is to be gathered via interviews be sure to accommodate this in the engagement-planning
        phase by adding more hours into the timeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Do the guiding principles contain too much detail relevant to a client’s low complexity e-business?&nbsp; If this
        is the case simply use guiding principles that apply to the components within the infrastructure.&nbsp; Again, the
        key is to be able to reference the client’s existing network versus best practice design principles.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate the location and elements of the current environment to be assessed.&nbsp; Ensure the SOW is clear in
        defining the location of the infrastructure and it’s demarcation points.&nbsp; For example, if the client has links
        to other web sites or systems across a WAN, this needs to be known ahead of time and appropriately scoped since
        this will have a direct impact on the time and effort required.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    3.2&nbsp; Validate the Team Skills
</h4>
<p>
    As with any engagement it is important that the team members understand the overall purpose or reason for using the
    guiding principles matrices.&nbsp; It’s just as important that they are familiar with the design points across the
    various tiers and have the skills to quickly compare them to the client environment.
</p>
<p>
    All practitioners should have credibility within the organization to perform the assessment; the team must avoid
    sending "whoever is free" for data gathering activities.&nbsp; The impact statements and recommendations will obviously
    depend on their experience.&nbsp; Since many of these e-business assessments are by nature short in duration ranging
    from 4-6 weeks, there is minimal time for follow-up interviews if not adequately executed the first time.
</p>
<p>
    Even though these engagements are short and performed with small teams of 3-4 practitioners, interviews are typically
    performed pairs.&nbsp; This balances skills and background ensuring that as much relevant information can be gathered
    efficiently while keeping the interview within the scope of the engagement.
</p>
<h4>
    3.3&nbsp; Select Data Gathering Technique
</h4>
<p>
    Assessments can be facilitated in a number of ways - via interviews, questionnaires, workshops or a combination
    thereof.&nbsp; Decide which is appropriate, based upon the scope, time available and assessment objectives.&nbsp; The
    use of the best practices design points is meant to add consistency, provide a logical segmented assessment technique
    and augment the regular assessment approaches.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Due to the breadth of infrastructure covered in the guiding principles, one to two workshops should be executed
        with client staff that can provide a high level overview of the architecture, end-to-end.&nbsp; Then move on to
        interviews for more detailed data gathering.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    3.4&nbsp; Map Client Infrastructure to the Four Tier Reference Model
</h4>
<p>
    The infrastructure design guiding principles matrices are based on a four-tiered conceptual model.&nbsp; Most clients,
    however, clients will have an n–tiered rather than a four- tiered e-business infrastructure.&nbsp; Because of this, the
    practitioners on the team will need to be technically adept enough to recognize this and evaluate where the various
    components in a client environment ‘should’ reside according to the guiding principles.&nbsp; Then assess these
    components versus that tier i.e. the tier the component should reside in.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the guiding principles dictate that no databases or application servers should reside in Tier I or
    II.&nbsp; In the event that the client has these types of servers in Tier II, two things should happen:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This does not meet best practices in Tier II and should be documented in the provided area within the Tier II
        section.<br />
        Continue to assess the Database and Application servers versus the best of breed design points in Tier III.&nbsp;
        Tier III is where these servers should reside according the conceptual model.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    3.5&nbsp; Assess the Client Infrastructure versus the Leading Design Practices
</h4>
<p>
    For each of the four tiers in the reference architecture:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Review each of the listed best of breed design points and business benefits.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Document the corresponding attributes of the client infrastructure, noting both where the current design complies
        with and where it deviates from the recommended practice.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each design point, review the client’s conformance or non-conformance and document the implications and identify
    any actions required to address significant exposure.
</p>
<h4>
    3.6&nbsp; Prepare the Assessment Report
</h4>
<p>
    Once the analysis has been completed for all aspects of all tiers, review the consolidated set of design implications
    and develop an integrated set of conclusions about the current infrastructure and any resulting recommendations and
    priorities for improvement actions.
</p>
