<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    A specification-level Operational Model is at an appropriate level of abstraction and detail to be used as a key part
    of an Invitation to Tender (ITT), where there is a need to maximize the opportunity for a wide range of vendors to
    present their best solution, without changing the overall structure of the design.&nbsp; Alternatively, the project
    team can subsequently develop the Operational Model to a physical level, by selecting software and technology products,
    which satisfy the specifications.
</p>
<p>
    This technique takes a conceptual-level Operational Model and transforms it in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It identifies the underlying technical requirements necessary to deliver the required business function where and
        when it is needed, with the appropriate service level characteristics and within the necessary constraints.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A subset of constraints have already been accommodated, specifically the limitations imposed on the design due to
        the non-functional capabilities of the solution’s network infrastructure.&nbsp; This has already largely determined
        the shape and style of the solution, in terms of the application’s data and function placement across the geography
        of the client.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It converts the vaguely defined conceptual nodes (which simply represent some form of approximate co-location of
        application-oriented deployment units) into fully specified, potentially independently deployable computer systems
        and other IT hardware, referred to as specified nodes.&nbsp; Specified nodes are described in terms of technical
        requirements, not technical products which meet these requirements<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It converts the “point-to-point” connections (which represent the required component interactions) into fully
        specified inter-node connections (referred to as connection segments since an interaction may need to be supported
        by several “linked” connections).&nbsp; Connection segments are described in terms of technical requirements, not
        technical products that meet these requirements.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It refines the system management requirements, described in general terms at the conceptual level, into full
        specifications.<br />
        During the transformation the deployment units and components may be relocated and/or redefined according to the
        design choices made.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This technique is used in parallel with specific techniques to design for availability, security, performance and
    capacity, and system management.
</p>
<p>
    As the Operational Model evolves throughout a project, it is common for different parts of it to be at different levels
    abstraction (and detail), and the technique should be applied flexibly to reflect this.
</p>
<p>
    As a ‘deployment unit’ is merely a convenient collection of components, the technique often refers to placing
    components rather than deployment units.&nbsp; Where it is important to distinguish between placing the data aspect,
    execution aspect, installation aspect, the term deployment unit is used.
