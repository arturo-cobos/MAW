    1&nbsp;Description
</h3>
<p>
    The objective of this technique paper is to define approaches that facilitate construction of a taxonomy.
</p>The purpose of a taxonomy is to provide an intuitive means to access textual document content. When properly
constructed, taxonomies present information in a contextually relevant manner. Also, taxonomies facilitate information
discovery, and improve user efficiency and effectiveness. 
<p>
    Taxonomies are different from search engines because they group information in a contextually logical and hierarchical
    manner. Users browse the categories represented in the hierarchy instead of entering a query. Taxonomies compliment
    search engines. They are not a replacement for search engines. If users know what they are looking for they generally
    use a search engine. If users want to see what is available in a certain category they can browse a taxonomy.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    Taxonomies add business value, and should be included in most business cases for portals.&nbsp; Elements to consider
    when building business cases for taxonomies include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        organization and cleanup of data,<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        thought leadership needs,<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        information reuse,<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        enhancements to text retrieval,<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        increased innovation due to information discovery, and<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        increased employee efficiency and effectiveness.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Greater use and acceptance of applications can be achieved if users are able to effectively and efficiently access
    information that is important or interesting to them.&nbsp; In many application implementations, such as portals, there
    is a large quantity of existing textual data with streams of new textual information added frequently.&nbsp; Without a
    taxonomy, it is common for users to become frustrated with the shear volume of information that is not logically or
    rapidly available.&nbsp; In more complex situations, there can be value in creating one or more taxonomies for specific
    user groups.<br />
    In cases where applications do not contain much textual data, there may be less need for a taxonomy.&nbsp; If there is
    low perceived customer value for a taxonomy and low volumes of textual content, there may be little reason to undertake
    the effort and expense to create and maintain one or more taxonomies.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    It is possible to create taxonomies manually through a long process of content examination, user interviews, reading,
    and manually creating and maintaining hyperlinks.&nbsp; However, in situation with large amounts of textual
    information, this may not be a practical approach. Alternatively, most software vendors involved with crating and
    maintaining taxonomies take one of two primary but different automated approached for building taxonomies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Approach 1:</strong>&nbsp; Semantic analysis software maps the relationships that exist between terms and
    phrases in content and those in a taxonomy.&nbsp; This can be used to automatically populate an existing taxonomy
    structure and create links to documents.&nbsp; Refinement of the taxonomy is then performed through examination of the
    results of this automatic population process.&nbsp; Categories that contain a large number of related sub-categories
    can be divided.&nbsp; Categories that contain few sub-categories or terms can often be consolidated into other
    categories.&nbsp; This is an iterative process of examination and refining that can be collaboratively performed with a
    user community.&nbsp; For more details on a semantic taxonomy approach, see section 3.1 below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Approach 2:</strong>&nbsp; Software packages that vectorize text (statistical means to analyze text) create
    internal mathematical representations that show similarities in between terms or phrases and documents.&nbsp; These
    similarities are used to generate a “best guess” hierarchical listing of terms that generate and populate an initial
    taxonomy.&nbsp; Placing more meaningful terms in place of those originally proposed refines initial taxonomies.&nbsp;
    An iterative and collaborative process similar to that described above can then be used to refine the taxonomy.&nbsp;
    For more details on software packages that generate taxonomies, see section 3.2 below.
</p>
<h4>
    3.1 Semantic taxonomy population approach
</h4>
<p>
    Taxonomy creation using semantic analysis software constists of the following four steps.
</p>
<h5>
    Step 1:&nbsp; Gather jargon, terms, and phrases
</h5>
<p>
    Create a comprehensive listing of relevant terms, user-specific jargon, and concept phases.&nbsp; This task can be
    greatly assisted by using text analysis software.&nbsp; The result of this gathering process is a lexical listing, or a
    lexicon.&nbsp; When developing a lexicon, all documents to be accessed by the taxonomy are collected and semantically
    analyzed for significant content.
</p>
<p>
    Semantic analyzers usually examine the sentence structures and the parts of speech associated with each word.&nbsp;
    Contextually significant words or phrases are extracted from the document and commonly placed into a phrase list. A
    high-quality lexicon is then constructed from the phrase list.&nbsp; Examination of this list with the users helps to
    create a production lexicon.&nbsp; Various terms and phrases often need to be omitted, while others may need
    substitution or expansion.&nbsp; For example, it may be desired to substitute International Business Machines for IBM,
    or D.C. for District of Columbia.&nbsp; The use of semantic analysis software is language dependent.&nbsp; It is
    important to consider which languages the analysis software supports, and which are important to the customer.&nbsp;
    This is a powerful method of text analysis, but it may be restrictive in some engagements where a wide variety of
    languages must be supported.
</p>
<p>
    Once a lexical list of semantically significant terms and phrases has been created it can be examined for key terms and
    phrases for use in a taxonomy.
</p>
<h5>
    Step 2:&nbsp; Create starter taxonomy
</h5>
<p>
    Create an initial high-level taxonomy structure for preliminary population and testing.&nbsp; This can be accomplished
    by reviewing the lexical term and phrase listings with subject matter experts and users to determine terms and phrases
    of major and minor interest.&nbsp; Create high-level topical categories first using terms or phrases of high
    interest.&nbsp; Expand each topic by assigning related subcategory terms and phrases to topics.&nbsp; Subcategory items
    can go into more than one high level category since topical relationships can span more than one conceptual
    topic.&nbsp; Subcategories can be subdivided into further subcategories.&nbsp; Typically a lexicon will contain about
    three category levels.&nbsp; While constructing the initial taxonomy, try to focus more upon the concepts expressed by
    the terms and phrases.&nbsp; Not every term or phrase that exists in the lexicon will need to be represented in the
    taxonomy.&nbsp; Try to use labels that describe the concepts rather than exact terms from the lexicon.<br />
    Once an initial structure has been built, examine the high-level categories to determine whether they represent all of
    the major concepts that are relevant to the user community and the document base.&nbsp; Next, examine the subcategories
    in each one to see if they make sense in the context of the major categories.
</p>
<h5>
    Step 3:&nbsp; Build initial taxonomy
</h5>
<p>
    Using the starter file, populate the taxonomy with all of the documents in the collection.&nbsp; Run the taxonomy
    software of your choice to create the document links.
</p>
<h5>
    Step 4:&nbsp; Review and refine
</h5>
<p>
    A newly-created taxonomy most likely needs to be refined to make it easier for users to find information.&nbsp; Two
    primary considerations during taxonomy refinement are accuracy and coverage.
</p>
<p>
    The accuracy of a taxonomy’s content links must be verified.&nbsp; Links must be contextually appropriate.&nbsp; For
    example, a category involving the manufacture of apparel should not contain any links to computer terms, such as “boot
    the computer,” which would clearly an inaccurate link.&nbsp; While accuracy can be checked to a large degree before
    involving users, some accuracy verification almost always takes place at a user level. Subject matter experts can
    participate in a short workshop to assist with initial validation efforts.&nbsp; Users normally find a number of errors
    at first.&nbsp; While such errors are easily corrected, it is important to keep user interest and participation.&nbsp;
    Such things as bug finding contests can help to both debug the taxonomy and keep users involved and interested in the
    process.&nbsp; Users should also be encouraged to point out anything which they do not understand, or which appears out
    of place.
</p>
<p>
    The coverage of a taxonomy involves its ability to include all relevant concepts that appear in the document
    collections.&nbsp; It is important that there be no holes in the coverage so that there are links to documents in all
    the areas of interest to the user community.&nbsp; This is a primary criterion for assessing coverage quality.&nbsp; At
    the time of this writing only a few software vendors have tools that can assist with coverage assessment.&nbsp; As a
    result,&nbsp; it is important to review the taxonomy with both subject matter experts and representative end users to
    assure adequate topical coverage.&nbsp; Users should be asked if there are areas of interest that are not represented
    in the categories.
</p>
<p>
    The next few paragraphs describe a typical process for refining a taxonomy.
</p>
<p>
    Check a number of links in the taxonomy to determine whether they are contextually appropriate.&nbsp; There will be
    some that are not logical.&nbsp; This check is used to help refine the taxonomy mappings for greater accuracy.&nbsp;
    The exact procedure for correcting and refining these mappings varies depending on the software used.
</p>
<p>
    Examine the number of links created in each subcategory.&nbsp; Subcategories containing a large number of links can be
    considered candidates for further subdivision.&nbsp; Those containing very few links may be candidates for merging with
    another subcategory.&nbsp; Merging subcategories may also be appropriate if the documents linked from one subcategory
    are very similar to those linked in another.
</p>
<p>
    This is also a good time to determine the number of subcategory levels that should be presented in each major category.
</p>
<p>
    Rebuild and repopulate the taxonomy.&nbsp; Review it again and make further corrections.&nbsp; Repeat this process
    until the taxonomy and its associated links give good topical coverage of all the terms of interest and they are
    accurately populated with the documents in the collection.
</p>
<h4>
    3.2 Taxonomy Generators
</h4>
<p>
    Statistical and neural analysis packages usually analyze text in a contextually independent manner.&nbsp; They
    typically assume that co-occurrence of terms within a document or the proximity of terms to each other carry
    significance about their relationship.&nbsp; These engines usually assign some manner of mathematical representation to
    the terms contained in a document collection.&nbsp; After the analysis has been done, it is usually possible to gather
    a listing of the terms deemed as significant.&nbsp; This listing is the initial lexicon.&nbsp; Some statistical
    software considers parts of speech before statistically analyzing text.&nbsp; This situation creates a language
    specific situation that needs to be examined for alignment with customer needs.&nbsp; Neural network based approaches
    typically do not use parts of speech analysis.&nbsp; Neural network-based approaches are often language
    independent.&nbsp; Taxonomy generation involves the following two steps.
</p>
<h5>
    Step 1:&nbsp; Build initial taxonomy:
</h5>
<p>
    The software package is run, usually using a small subset of the document corpus, and an initial taxonomy is
    generated.&nbsp; The initial taxonomy is often the result of some form of clustering algorithm.&nbsp; The software
    examines the predominance of terms that occur near the centroid of each cluster, and assigns a term to a high-level
    category that it associates with the cluster.&nbsp; Statistically secondary terms are placed inside this category, and
    a hierarchy is begun. Thus an initial taxonomy is machine generated.
</p>
<h5>
    Step 2:&nbsp; Review and refine taxonomy:
</h5>
<p>
    This process is similar to the one described above (step 4 of section 3.1).&nbsp; However, this process also includes
    elements that are similar to those of building a taxonomy.&nbsp; The machine-extracted terms are examined and replaced
    by terms and phrases that are more contextually meaningful to the user community.&nbsp; This can be an easier process
    if a lexicon is already available.&nbsp; However, not all of the software that generates a starter taxonomy creates a
    lexicon.&nbsp; Step 1 in section 3.1 (gather jargon, terms, and phrases) can be useful during step.&nbsp; Additionally,
    in most cases a small subset of the corpus has been used, so few terms are available and fewer represented in the
    initial build.&nbsp; Particular care must be given to interviewing subject matter experts and representatives of the
    user community in order to assure high-quality representations in the taxonomy.&nbsp; It is important to avoid the
    temptation to let the machine-produced taxonomy go relatively unmodified.&nbsp; In order to assure the usability and
    contextual pertinence of the taxonomy, the starter taxonomy must be reviewed and modified.
</p>
<p>
    The remainder of the taxonomy refinement process is quite similar to that in the semantic approach (section 3.1) since
    iterative builds and reviews should be completed.&nbsp; The goal remains to achieve high coverage and accuracy in the
    final population and linking of the taxonomy.
