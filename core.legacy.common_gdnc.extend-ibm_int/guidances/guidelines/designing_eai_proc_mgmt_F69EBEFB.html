    This technique provides an approach to design the process management capabilities within a defined EAI subsystem. This
    design, as depicted in Figure 1, below, is performed after the physical architecture, and system design for the EAI
    subsystem is established, meaning:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Functional partitioning to EAI products and components is complete
    </li>
    <li>
        EAI subsystem standards are established, including inter-component communications and interfaces to customer
        infrastructure services
    </li>
    <li>
        Allocation of performance, capacity and availability budgets to EAI products and components is complete.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Since the facilities of EAI packaged products vary widely, it is not feasible to completely address product extensions
    or custom component needs for a process manager within the scope of a general design technique. As a result, the
    primary focus for this technique is to establish the specification details for process management that are independent
    of process manager implementation. In addition, the technique addresses design tooling considerations for process
    management.
</p>
<p>
    There is a preferred order to the design analysis for process management due to the control and system state
    interactions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Complete EAI process decomposition
    </li>
    <li>
        Select the approaches to business transaction handling
    </li>
    <li>
        Extend the processes to include recovery handling
    </li>
    <li>
        Extend the processes to include solution recovery handling
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify & specify manual procedures.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note: EAI Attributes Blueprint is a requirements deliverable for EAI engagements.

    <b>Definitions</b><br />
    <br />
    An EAI subsystem is responsible for providing the necessary integration conduits, including proper business semantics,
    and business process linkage, to enable the assembly of a defined business system, composed of
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Application packages
    </li>
    <li>
        Legacy custom applications
    </li>
    <li>
        Application components
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing client infrastructure services
    </li>
    <li>
        External business partner systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Externalized business unit systems of the same enterprise
    </li>
    <li>
        Includes standard content and representation of solution business entities
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the highest level (prior to package introduction), an EAI subsystem is composed of just a few components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Process Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Brokering
    </li>
    <li>
        Adapters
    </li>
    <li>
        Common Services
    </li>
    <li>
        Custom Components
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In general, process management services are implemented in both the process management and adapter components. As a
    result, adapter component architects and designers, as well as process management component architects and designers
    should read this technique.
</p>
<p>
    It is important during the design process to cleanly partition the Business Process Modeling / Management (BPM) and EAI
    process management design issues. This technique addresses only EAI process management. It assumes that BPM design for
    the system is complete and consistent. EAI process management is ONLY concerned with the closure of process activity
    between the end points that provide the core of the systemâ€™s business functionality.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example EAI Problem</b>
</p>
<p>
    The example EAI problem referenced throughout the rest of this document can be found in Appendix A: EAI Example Problem
    Background.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Document Structure</b>
</p>
<p>
    The remainder of this document is organized around the core process management design areas to enable process
    management services. Note that connection is a base facility that applies to all EAI subsystem components, and is
    normally covered as a part of the EAI subsystem design.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Context</b>
</p>
<p>
    This document applies to all EAI subsystem application contexts, whether confined within a client enterprise, or
    extended to include business partner enterprises. In addition, it applies whether the ultimate integration required is
    data oriented in nature or includes business process logic.
