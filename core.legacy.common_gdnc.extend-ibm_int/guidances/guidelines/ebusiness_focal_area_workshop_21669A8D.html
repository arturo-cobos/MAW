    1&nbsp;Overview
</h3>
<p>
    When developing an e-Business strategy, companies need to think broadly about how e-Business can be used to change the
    nature of business relationships. It is important to consider customer and supplier relationships and where value is
    created in these interactions. However, it is also important to look for new and perhaps unexpected opportunities for
    "co-opetition" with traditional competitors and for new partnerships with complementors of the company’s products,
    services and relationships.
</p>
<p>
    The Focal Area ("Killer-e") Workshop is a technique for rapidly developing a list of "focal areas" that characterize
    high-value opportunities along these lines for additional exploration. This approach may involve a single workshop or a
    number of workshops, depending on the scope of the engagement. Each workshop will typically run for one or two days,
    largely driven by the number of value nets that are constructed and analyzed.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the workshop, executive interviews and other data gathering exercises should be conducted to provide
    background and input to the workshop activities. The workshop itself is focused on identifying an initial set of high
    value/high impact areas where e-business can contribute to addressing key opportunity areas and/or achieving strategic
    business goals, also called "focal areas". To reach this goal, the workshop focuses first on setting a vision for the
    client’s use of e-Business, and understanding other players in the client’s value net. Once players have been
    identified, the team lists potential value propositions between players on the value net and then groups these value
    propositions into potential focal areas. Finally, the team selects focal areas for additional exploration based on
    agreed-upon criteria. These selected focal areas can also be considered to be hypotheses that will guide future
    engagement efforts.
</p>This technique is performed in the task, Identify e-business Focal Area(s), within the "Define/Refine e-business
Direction" set of activities.

<h3>
    2&nbsp;Purpose
</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of the “Killer-e” Workshop is threefold. First, the workshop helps to improve client understanding of
    e-Business and how it can impact their organization. Second, the workshop provides a mechanism for identifying high
    impact value propositions across the value chain. Third, the workshop prioritizes and focuses the team on a key set of
    focal areas to pursue.
</p>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    First, the team must prepare for the Focal Area (“Killer-e”) Workshop. This activity includes typical workshop
    preparation activities such as arranging for facilities, developing an agenda and detailed approach, ensuring that
    appropriate participants have been invited, and identifying required materials. More importantly, the team must prepare
    materials that will be used in workshop execution (Executive Briefing Package work product description). Sources of
    input for these materials include interviews with executives or other key stakeholders, existing client documentation,
    industry knowledge and research, and other e-Business intellectual capital. The materials to be used in the workshop
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Documented Business Environment, Strategic Direction and Strategic Market Position<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Prioritization criteria and weightings (Decision Model)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        List of players in the value net (Business Environment from Understand Project Context task)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Summary of executive interviews (Critical Issues, Opportunities and Recommendations)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Executive Briefing Package&nbsp; (generic and/or industry as applicable)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Second, the team must execute the workshop itself. There are seven steps involved:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Educate the team on e-Business – provide client team members with a common understanding of e-Business and a common
        language to communicate with each other and other stakeholders. May involve a team-building exercise, review of the
        e-Business education package, or a small group exercise to identify and discuss the best and worst sites on the
        Internet. This step uses the Executive Briefing Package work product.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Review and validate criteria and weightings to be used for selection of e-Business opportunities – starting with a
        list of criteria generated from executive interviews, the team reviews, discusses and finalizes this list, and then
        weights the criteria. One approach for weighting is to give each person 100 points to allocate to the criteria, and
        then to sum up the scores and create a weighted average for each criterion. This step updates the Decision Model
        work product.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop an e-Business vision statement – this step develops a shared e-Business vision. An approach is to break the
        group into small teams, and to have each team write an e-Business vision statement for the company or business
        unit, to write a “day in the life” story for a person living in the e-Business vision world, and to present these
        to the group. After the small teams have presented, the group must establish a single vision statement by either
        combining or selecting one of the vision statements. This step updates the Strategic Direction work product.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Build value nets – this step uses value nets as an approach to identifying the relationships between the company
        and its customers, suppliers, competitors and complementors. This step uses the Value Net template (see
        illustration below) to identify customers, suppliers, complementors and competitors (or substitutors) for each key
        stakeholder and subclass of stakeholders within the company. This step updates the Business Environment work
        product.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Identify value propositions – value propositions identify the benefits that each player delivers to various other
    players in the value chain through its offerings (the illustration below shows a simple value net with a set of value
    propositions). They include features of the offerings and the way they are delivered. To perform this step, the team
    must explore the relationship between the company and all players in the value net, as well as relationships between
    the other players (customers to competitors and complementors, suppliers to competitor and complementors). This step
    further updates the Business Environment work product.

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Consolidate value propositions – cluster the value propositions into like groups using Metaplan or another
        clustering/facilitation technique. Once each cluster or focal area has been identified, document information on
        that focal area such as targeted stakeholders, other value net players, stakeholder value propositions, other
        player value propositions, and description (a template is available for this purpose). This step updates the
        Business Environment work product.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Select focal areas – based on the selection criteria identified above, have the team allocate points to each focal
        area and select the top 2 – 5 for further exploration. If more than one “Killer-e” Workshop has been held, a core
        team should consolidate the selections and do a final ranking. This step updates the Strategic Market Position,
        Strategic Direction and Critical Issues, Opportunities and Recommendations work products.
    </li>
</ul>
