<p>
    The approach is divided into the following five steps. The aim is to provide the information needed by the business
    process redesign teams.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Review the client customer requirements internally
    </li>
    <li>
        Review existing customer evaluations of the client performance to specific requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Review customers’ plans and expected requirements for the future
    </li>
    <li>
        Link requirements and the client’s performance with specific business processes
    </li>
    <li>
        Organize and integrate customer requirements into the critical issues and entry point deliverable and ultimately
        the process redesign effort
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The following section summarizes the approach for each of the above steps:
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Step 1 - Review the client customer requirements internally
</h4>
<p>
    Review of the client’s customer requirements will consist of the collection and processing of existing documentation
    from within various the client sources.&nbsp; It is expected that management will direct the&nbsp;team to the best
    available sources of this data and provide additional the client support in the collection process as required.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to reviewing existing documentation, it is also expected that the team will interview key the client
    personnel close to the customer requirements definition process.&nbsp; Management will assist the team in the
    identification of these individuals who it is expected will include personnel such as sales representatives and account
    executives.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 - Review existing customer evaluations of the client performance to specific requirements
</h4>
<p>
    As with the previous steps, it is assumed that the client has information pertaining to customer evaluation of its
    performance in satisfying key requirements.&nbsp; This information is important to the business process redesign effort
    in that it provides two major points of information.&nbsp; First, it establishes a baseline against which future state
    performance will be measured and second, it indicates where the largest gaps between the client performance and
    customer expectation are, highlighting the areas of concentration for business process redesign within the processes.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 - Review customers’ plans and expected requirements for the future
</h4>
<p>
    A critical step in the customer requirements effort is to determine what the customer’s future requirements will be and
    how that affects the various processes within the client. The value of this information in the business process
    redesign effort is obvious in that it provides for future state targets to be designed to for each process.&nbsp; We
    recommend that the customers’ future requirements are investigated twofold:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Through interviews with the client representatives. This can be combined with step 1 ("Review the client customer
        requirements").<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Through interviews with selected customers. The&nbsp; team needs to choose a sample of large and&nbsp;&nbsp; medium
        sized customers, that will be representative of most customers. The interviews might be held via phone,
        videoconference or the team might need to visit customers sites. We recommend to perform approximately 5 - 10
        customer interviews.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Although all customers may not have identified all of their To-Be requirements, it is likely that they will have at
    least identified the direction they foresee their business heading.&nbsp; Based on this direction, it is expected that
    the client has then translated this vision into the subsequent requirements, which will be required to support
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4 - Link requirements and the client’s performance with specific business processes
</h4>
<p>
    A critical step in the customer requirements effort is the consolidation and linkage of various customer requirements
    into the business process areas which they affect.&nbsp; For instance, a customer requirement that the client provide
    EDI for order entry would be categorized into the Order Management business process as this is the area to which the
    requirement pertains.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for the linkage of requirements according to their business process is that the customer requirements will
    be incorporated into the reengineered processes to ensure that the To-Be process satisfies the customer’s wants and
    needs.&nbsp; Without this linkage it will be difficult to ensure that the business process redesign effort is being
    driven by customer requirements and that the goal of increasing customer satisfaction is being met.
</p>
<p>
    Actual work in this area will consist of the decision into which specific process a requirement should be grouped
    (possibly more than one).
</p>
<h4>
    Step 5 - Organize and integrate customer requirements into the critical issues and entry points deliverable and
    ultimately the process redesign effort
</h4>
<p>
    The final step in the customer requirements effort is the integration of the information collected in steps one through
    four into the critical issues and entry points deliverable. This will be accomplished through the distribution of
    customer requirements to the respective business process redesign teams.&nbsp; In cases where requirements cross or
    affect multiple processes, the requirement will be distributed to all those teams affected.
</p>
<p>
    The above requirements information will be utilized initially by the teams through the workshops in which the To-Be
    process will be designed.&nbsp; The requirements will be introduced as primary drivers and continuously revisited as a
    validation for the developing designs.&nbsp; This structured verification process is designed to ensure that processes
    provide value to the customer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Examples of Requirements and Customer Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The following sections give examples of the type of information which will be required during the customer requirements
    effort.&nbsp; The examples given here are divided into two major sections.&nbsp; The first section illustrates high
    level information requirements, while the second section provides more detailed examples of the information
    needed.&nbsp; The second section also divides the requirements into several process examples which, as stated
    previously, would be a necessary step in the overall requirements effort.
</p>
<p>
    As stated previously, this is not intended to be a comprehensive list, but merely examples of the types of information
    to be collected.&nbsp;<br />
    <strong>High Level Information Requirements</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Specific points of contact between the customer and the client<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Ranked list of points of contact in order of importance to the customer<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluation of the client’s performance/service in each of these points of contact<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluation of competition’s performance in points of contact with relation to the client<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Customer viewpoint on the future of their business (i.e. where is the industry heading, what major initiatives do
        you see launching, etc.) and where does the client fit in<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Customer input on single issues the client could address to improve service/satisfaction today<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Customer viewpoint on what the client will have to do in the future to remain/become supplier of choice (e.g.
        vendor managed inventory, or increased emphasis on category management)<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        More detailed examples of the kind of information relating to its customer requirements is given below.&nbsp; These
        requirements are broken down by major process, a necessary step in the overall customer requirements effort.
