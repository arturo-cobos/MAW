    This paper will provide practical techniques for Service-Oriented Architecture (hereafter referred to as SOA) system
    testing.&nbsp; The discussion will cover SOA system testing on a conceptual level so that the ideas presented here can
    be used for all tests regardless of what is being tested; i.e., different hardware platforms, systems software,
    applications, and/or databases.&nbsp; This paperâ€™s intended audience includes those who will be testing, managing
    testing or planning testing for SOA solutions that use the operational infrastructure.&nbsp; Developers of Middleware
    products are not part of the intended audience.
</p>
<p>
    SOA System Testing should be differentiated from other levels and types of testing. SOA System Testing involves testing
    solutions that integrate business processes and supporting IT infrastructure as secure, standardized services that can
    be reused and combined to address changing business priorities. SOA solutions use business choreography, i.e a
    structured sequence of service executions, to integrate these business processes and supporting IT infrastructure via
    tooling with rules for choreography stored outside of the application. SOA System Testing focuses on both testing the
    individual services that make up the application, as well as testing the involved applications themselves. Both
    functional and structural types of tests are performed to verify that the system is functionally and operationally
    sound.&nbsp; A detailed description of testing the operational infrastructure is outside the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, there are some qualifications that should be noted about this discussion.&nbsp; This paper is purposely
    written from the perspective of how an external test team would approach SOA System Testing on behalf of a
    customer.&nbsp; Furthermore, SOA System Testing is almost always done within certain constraints (i.e., cost and time
    for testing) as well as within various business or technical contexts.&nbsp; While these considerations are very
    important in preparing a strategy for testing, offering a proposal, or creating a SOA system test plan, they are
    deliberately left out of this paper because they will vary from project to project.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any guidance we could
    offer would be too general to be of value.
