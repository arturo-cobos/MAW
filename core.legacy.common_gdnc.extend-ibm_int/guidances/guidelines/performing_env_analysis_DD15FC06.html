    <b>What is an Environment Analysis?</b>
</p>
<p>
    The Environment Analysis provides the engagement team with an accurate description of the client’s technical and
    cultural environment, to enable the design of an appropriate, useful, and functioning learning solution.
</p>
<p>
    This analysis identifies and documents characteristics of the technical infrastructure and culture of the client
    organization. These characteristics include all information relevant to the design and development of the deliverables,
    such as connectivity issues, work environment, and operating platform.
</p>
<h3>
    2&nbsp;Context
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Why Perform an Environment Analysis?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The primary benefits of an Environment Analysis include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Environment Analysis identifies the characteristics of the learning environment, enabling the design of a
        learning solution that will function in the intended environment, will suit the culture of the client organization,
        and will be of more value to the client than would be on off-the-shelf solution.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Environment Analysis will identify any special needs of the client organization, such as the need for
        technology-based training that can be delivered over a slow connection, or the need for training that can be of use
        to learners who have only a few minutes a day to devote to training.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        The Environment Analysis will help the Instructional Designer identify the most appropriate theme and treatment for
        the learning solution, and will serve as an aid for designing any real-life scenarios that may be scripted as part
        of the solution.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>When Should You Perform an Environment Analysis?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Once the need for a learning intervention has been identified, an Environment Analysis is typically performed when the
    delivery environment and organization culture is unknown, especially in the following situations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scenarios and simulations related to real-life job situations are needed.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Training is targeted at learners in several client locations.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        It is anticipated that a technology based learning solution will be needed.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3&nbsp;Steps
</h3>
<p>
    The following is meant as guidance only. There are many methods for conducting an Environment Analysis. Please refer to
    the “Tools” section to view some available resources.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify the environment characteristics that are relevant to the design of the learning solution. These
        characteristics may include (but are not limited to) one or more of the following: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Culture of the Orgnization 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        History of the orgnization
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mission statement
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        information identified in step one.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Schedule meetings with the representatives named in the meeting with the project sponsor. Gather information
        related to the characteristics identified in step one.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a table with three columns: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Characteristic – In this column, list the characteristics identified in step 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Description – In this column, list the findings from step 3.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design Implications – In this column, indicate the way in which the design of the learning solution will
                support the specific characteristics of the audience.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These findings should be included in any standards documentation for the engagement.
