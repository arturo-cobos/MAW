<p>
    The project team will gather all existing strategy and industry trend information and attempt to enhance this
    information where required by conducting individual interviews with the client executives. With this in mind, our
    approach is divided into the following major steps which will provide the information needed by teams:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Review the client’s last year and this year (if available) Strategic Plans including any and all information on
        industry trends
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirm and enhance understanding of the client’s strategy and pertinent industry trends with appropriate corporate
        and divisional executives (interviews)
    </li>
    <li>
        Link strategic plans and initiatives and industry trends into specific business processes depicted in the business
        process model (vs. segmentation by division)
    </li>
    <li>
        Organize and integrate strategy and trend information into the critical issues and entry points deliverable and
        ultimately in the business process redesign effort
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The following section summarizes the approach for each of the above steps:
</p>
<h3>
    2 Steps
</h3>
<h4>
    Step 1 – Review the client’s last year and this year (if available) Strategic Plans and Industry Trend Information
</h4>
<p>
    Review of the client’s strategy and industry trend information will consist of the collection and processing of
    existing documentation from within various the client sources, focusing primarily on the last year strategic plans and
    the current year strategic plans (if they are available).&nbsp; It is expected that the client management will direct
    the project team to the best available sources for any additional strategic and industry trend information required and
    provide sufficient support in the collection process.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 2 – Confirm and enhance understanding of the client strategy and pertinent industry trends with appropriate
    corporate and divisional executives (interviews)
</h4>
<p>
    Following the review of existing documentation on the client strategy and industry trends, it will be necessary to
    confirm and build upon the understanding of this information by interviewing the appropriate executives of the
    company.&nbsp; These interviews should be contained to key representatives of both corporate and the divisions who are
    in the position to enhance the project team’s understanding of both the strategy and industry trends as well as insight
    as to how the client’s management prioritizes these elements. In addition, the interviews should give the team a clear
    understanding of what current initiatives are under way, their progress to date and the methods used in measuring their
    status and effectiveness.&nbsp; The results of these interviews will be vital input into both the strategic and
    industry trend confirmation effort as well as the required prioritization effort for these areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Step 3 –&nbsp; Link strategic plans and initiatives and industry trends into specific business processes depicted in
    the business process model (vs. segmentation by division)
</h4>
<p>
    A critical step in the strategy and industry trend confirmation effort is the consolidation and linkage of various
    initiatives and trends into the business process areas which they effect.&nbsp; This process step is different from the
    typical linkages which are usually established between initiative/trend and a division or specific business area, in
    that it ties the strategic initiatives and trends directly to the processes they will affect. The reason for this
    linkage by process area is that the orientation of the redesign effort itself will be by process area and all pertinent
    information must be identified by area.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for the linkage of strategic initiatives and trends according to their business process is that these
    initiatives and trends will be incorporated into the redesigned processes to ensure that the future state process is in
    keeping with management’s vision for the future of the company.&nbsp; Without this linkage it would be difficult to
    ensure that the business process redesign effort is being driven by vital strategic initiatives of the client and the
    major trends in its industry.
</p>
<p>
    Actual work in this area will consist of the decision into which specific process an initiative or trend should be
    grouped (possibly more than one) and the entry of that information into a template.
</p>
<h4>
    Step 4 – Organize and integrate strategy and trend information into the critical issues and entry points deliverable
    and ultimately in the business process redesign effort
</h4>
<p>
    The final step in the strategy confirmation and industry trend analysis effort is the integration of the information
    collected in steps one through three into the critical issues and entry points deliverable. This will be accomplished
    through the distribution of the prioritized and linked strategic initiatives and industry trends to the respective
    project teams.&nbsp; In cases where initiatives and trends cross or affect multiple processes, they will be distributed
    to all those teams affected.&nbsp; Additionally, the information pertaining to the current status of the initiatives
    with respect to the specific process areas will also be distributed to the pertinent teams.
</p>
<p>
    The above strategy and trend information will be utilized initially by the project teams through the workshops in which
    the To-Be processes will be designed. The initiatives and trends will be introduced as primary drivers and continuously
    revisited as a validation for the developing designs.&nbsp; This structured verification process is designed to ensure
    that future state processes meet the overall vision of the client executives for the company well past the time of
    implementation.<br />
