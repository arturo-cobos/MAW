    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    The tool contains all the necessary forms to collect, analyze and present the results of the Business Case (e.g.
    Business Case Work Product) in financial and non-financial terms. From a financial perspective, the tool calculates
    ROWI (return on Web-Investment), states the project/initiative financial benefit, reports intangible benefit impact,
    states the estimated e-business investment and operating costs, calculates the number of months for "double" the
    payback and presents the relative e-business initiative risks.
</p>
<p>
    The intent of the tool is to provide a repository for gathering financial and non-financial information throughout the
    life cycle of all projects from small to large. The tool is designed to facilitate the gathering of data by providing
    worksheets that can be distributed to client team members for completion or used as an interview guides for the IBM
    Consultants. The tool also provides a "point and click" navigation aid to access the data sheets from the WBS guide.
    This technique paper will provide the roadmap for using the tool and guidance on the data content, analysis and
    reporting. The key sections of the tool are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Executive Summary - a summary for senior management review of the Valuation assessment by initiative
    </li>
    <li>
        Financial Impact Schedule - a summary of the financial costs & benefits over time typically viewed by a
        controller
    </li>
    <li>
        Financial Assumptions Worksheet - an outline of significant assumptions backing the detail data
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>

    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Steps
</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of this technique paper is to guide the user through the use of an e-business – Business Case Tool to be
    used in the financial and business case analysis of e-business initiatives.&nbsp; Its intended use is with the
    e-business Strategy & Design Offering and the “Fast Path” version that is designed to deliver an e-business pilot
    within 12 to 16 weeks. The tool can be used to track and evaluate multiple e-business initiatives and pilots.&nbsp; The
    tool is also intended to be used End-to-End within an engagement to allow the project management team to gather initial
    data and refine the data with concrete results as the project matures.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
    Intangible benefits include positive impact to the business in view of its customers, its internal business processes,
    its innovation and learning (e.g. of its employees).&nbsp; Some intangible benefits may be translated into financial
    measures given sufficient time to establish linkages to measurable financial levers.
</p>

</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Phase 6 – Assess Risks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Risks are the possible events or factors that could have a negative impact on the overall success of the project.&nbsp;
    Risk factors are assessed for the following categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Financial impact<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Operational impact<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Cultural and Organizational impact<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Marketing impact<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Technology impact, and<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Other potential areas of concern to the client
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each risk is assessed in terms of severity of impact and the potential occurrence.&nbsp; Using these two measures,
    adjusted risk is calculated.
</p>
<p>
    Activities:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify Potential Risks<br />

        Develop Risk Mitigation / Contingency Plan<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Assign Score Values to Each Risk
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Assumptions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Client will provide the key stakeholders who will work with the team to identify and evaluate risk factors
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Phase 7 – Calculate Metrics & Update Assumptions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    During this phase, the financial and non-financial valuation measures are calculated and analyzed.&nbsp; The
    assumptions are also reviewed and updated to ensure that all factors and measures are properly aligned with the
    initiative objectives and that all stakeholders and management teams are apprised of the results.
</p>
<p>
    Activities:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Update Assumptions<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Calculate Confidence-Adjusted ROWI Ranges and Other Metrics
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Assumptions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Client project management and senior management team will review the e-business – Business Case results.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Tools
</h3>
<p>
    The e-business – Business Case Tool is designed with an internal roadmap to guide the user to the appropriate data
    sheet to be completed for each Phase defined above.&nbsp; The tool is written in Excel and provides hot links to help
    the consultant navigate to the appropriate worksheet from the following “Spreadsheet Organization”.&nbsp;

<h3>
    Estimating Considerations
</h3>
<p>
    The estimated time frame for completing the business model using the e-business – Business Case Tool is about 6-8 week
    elapsed time or a baseline estimate of 40 person-days.&nbsp; This is a preliminary estimate at this time and assumes
    that the client meets the “medium” expectations for the five-(5) key levers that affect consultant hours.&nbsp; These
    levers are:&nbsp; Available Baseline Cost Data; Status of a Strategic Business Plan; Client team participation;
    Client’s communication plans; and, Executive Champion for the initiative.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Assumptions for the following baseline estimated hours are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        This is a “fast path” e-business strategy & design engagement with a total elapsed time of 12 to 16 weeks.
    </li>
    <li>
        This business case effort is for a “single” e-business initiative and pilot of typical size and complexity from a
        technology perspective.
    </li>
    <li>
        That the client team will perform most of the data gathering using the data gathering templates provided in the
        e-business – Business Case Tool.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The steps for using this guideline is includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Evaluate the five key drivers of consultant time giving a H=High, M=Medium, or L=Low capability.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Apply the value for each driver to the baseline hours where they apply (indicated by X’s).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarize the revised hours for each phase.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Estimating Guideline Template:
</p><img height="405" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/ebusinesscase_businesstool_fig4.JPG" width="777" /><br />
<p>
    Here is an example of an evaluation of a client’s readiness to support the business case:&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Availability of Baseline Cost Data&nbsp;&nbsp; = L
</p>
<p>
    Strategic Plan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = H
</p>
<p>
    Client Team Participation&nbsp;&nbsp; = M
</p>
<p>
    Communication Plan&nbsp;&nbsp; = L
</p>
<p>
    Executive Champion&nbsp;&nbsp; = H
</p>
<p>
    <img height="249" alt="" src="./../../../core.legacy.common_gdnc.extend-ibm_int/guidances/toolmentors/resources/ebusinesscase_businesstool_fig5.JPG" width="724" />
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    This example resulted in a 58.5 increase in total hours over the base, which is about a 15% increase.&nbsp; Upon
    further analysis, the reason for this increase is primarily due to the fact that the client does not have baseline cost
    data to support this initiative.&nbsp; While the “Communications Plan” rating is low resulting in a 33% increase for
    several phases, this increase is partially offset by a strong strategic plan and executive champion.
