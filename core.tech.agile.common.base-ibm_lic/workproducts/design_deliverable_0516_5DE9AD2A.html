    The&nbsp;Design Deliverable&nbsp;consists of the following as appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Architecture Overview Diagrams depicting the current and to-be architectures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Entity Relationship Diagram for the Logical Data Model.
    </li>
    <li>
        Application Component Relationship and Sequence Models, and other application-related requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Descriptions of other considerations that affect the architecture and design (e.g., Job Scheduling Considerations,
        Data Conversion Requirements, Data Interchange Requirements, etc.).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is also referred to as high-level or macro design.
</p>
<p>
    The project’s Design Deliverable may be part of a larger design.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Specify cross-release technical details
    </li>
    <li>
        Address the global architectural issues which effect all iterations or releases
    </li>
    <li>
        Minimize long term development cost by eliminating as much rework, from release to release, as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Further, the business marketplace is characterized today by constant change.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure flexible systems that can accommodate unforeseen change
    </li>
    <li>
        Present a high-level application-specific design that allows for iteratively prototyping
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This includes:
</p>

                subsystems, components, nodes, connections, data stores, uses, external systems and supporting text. Note
                that this is usually based on the client’s reference architecture patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
                Component Model – How the application as a whole is structured across releases, including how major parts
                of the application communicate with one another and how project releases are consistent with the overall
                structure of the application.
            </li>
            <li>
                Operational Model – Defines the hardware/software/network infrastructure required across releases,
                including how the components are distributed to the various infrastructure nodes and how project releases
                share a consistent infrastructure with other releases.
            </li>
            <li>
                Architectural Templates – Defines the cross-release application architectural framework that defines the

                physical database.
            </li>
            <li>
                System Process Model in a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) – Capture the automated system processes required to
                support the business requirements and the structuring, relationships and flow between processes, including
                interfaces and data exchanges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Application Model – Platform dependent approach that includes the program module invocation model,
                high-level module specifications, transaction descriptions and the physical database design to enable code
                development.

                Static testing – Test work products using techniques such as inspection, walk through, prototyping,
                reviews, checklists, mapping and structured workshops to ensure defects are found as close to their source
                as possible and fixed early in the life-cycle before they are passed on.
