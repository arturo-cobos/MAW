    It is used to plan and manage the “Agile with Discipline” approach for each project, which allows the team to clearly
    communicate expectations with stakeholders on a weekly basis, while empowering them to elaborate on the details each
    week. Portions of it may be supported through automated Agile tooling, such as Rational Team Concert or another agile
    tool. When baselined on a weekly basis, it allows the team to communicate the progress the team has made against the
    planned stories / functions, and informally what changes were made (adds/deletes or elaboration to scope) to
    stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    The Accelerator Plan will consist of the following as appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        User types / personas – Describes the list of users, groups, their roles and personas (when applicable).
    </li>
    <li>
        Prioritization rules - Using “MoSCoW” (Must, Should, Could, or Want) rules approach.
    </li>
    <li>
        Functionality List – A list of identified and categorized functional requirements, written in story format, with
        assumptions, estimates and actual effort in person days, and planned iteration for that function.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dropped from scope list – Lit of functions that the stakeholder has decided to move out of scope for the current
        iteration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Timeboxes – Fixed start and end dates for each iteration over the duration of the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reuse Plan – Description of components that are being used instead of built from scratch (e.g. Websphere Commerce
        components, Existing Services).
    </li>
    <li>
        Accelerator Usage – Usage rating and description of how each AWD technique will be used.

    This includes taking an iterative approach while performing the following activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Further refine the high-level solution requirements that were developed in the Agile Project Definition and
        Charter, Project Management System Summary&nbsp;and first-draft Accelerator Plan. Specifically:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Profile, verify, clarify and reprioritize, if necessary, each user group, i.e., users with unique
                functionality in the resulting system (e.g., separate screens, reports, processes).
            </li>
            <li>
                Further identify, detail, describe and prioritize each requirement. For example:

        Leverage Joint Application Development/Design/Requirements (JAD/JAR) techniques, where appropriate. JAD/JAR is a
        mechanism in which business customers, subject matter experts and technical experts collectively attend intense

        Use the Iteration column of the AWD Accelerator Plan&nbsp;to group prioritized-requirements into three equal-sized
        iterations, effectively specifying the Release Plan. Have the Business Customer, Architect and Lead Developer
        estimate sizing and validate with existing function point estimates. Ensure estimates account for
        refactoring.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Allow for variable scope. Note:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Projects are generally thought to contain three primary dimensions of delivery: scope as defined by
                requirements, schedule as indicated by time, and cost of resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                AWD differs from most traditional projects in that it fixes the dimensions of schedule and cost, and plans
                to allow the scope to vary. Most delivery approaches strive to fix all three dimensions and end up varying
                schedule and cost by default, i.e., delivering late and/or over budget.
            </li>
            <li>
                Achieving variable scope in an AWD project is possible due to multiple AWD Accelerators. AWD breaks
                solution development into multiple, time-boxed iterations, usually three. The functional content of each of
                these iterations is determined and prioritized throughout the AWD project by the business customer, who is
                a co-located, empowered, member of the delivery team. This prioritization process ensures highest-priority
                functionality is always delivered first. Any functionality not delivered by the third iteration is lowest
                priority in the eyes of the business customer. This “thrifted scope” may be delivered later as a separate
                project or by an application maintenance and support effort, if found to still be necessary.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Rearrange the list of requirements and modules as necessary to ensure timebox end dates are met
    </li>
    <li>
        Further define completion criteria for each timebox, i.e., describe work products required by the Timebox End Date
    </li>
    <li>
        Further describe how each AWD Accelerator/Best Practice is to be used on the project
    </li>
    <li>
        Search for reusable work products in intellectual capital repositories and via other sources repeatedly, and update
        the Reuse Plan in the AWD Accelerator Plan to reflect this information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Trace requirements by (a) numbering requirements and (b) indicating for each component/module listed in the AWD
        Accelerator Plan which requirements it addresses. Refer to Requirements Traceability Matrix&nbsp;for more
        information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the AWD Accelerator Plan regularly with stakeholders and update it based on feedback

    In general, developing requirements has these benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensures team understands the business context of the solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides a consistent definition of the customer’s business as it pertains to the solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the complexity and scope of the solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Helps customer make informed investment decision
    </li>
    <li>
        Allows team to get in and out rapidly, collecting and developing only the information absolutely needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies changes to business processes, technologies, and organizations that occur through the introduction of
        new ways of doing business
    </li>
    <li>
        Focuses on visible properties/components and their functional/operational context
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides a view of the solution's impacts
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides team with "due diligence" regarding the project feasibility
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensures required organization change is planned for and addressed in later phases
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The process to fully develop requirements may include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Review the current customer environment – Define all facets of the “as is” customer environment to facilitate
        mapping to the “to be” and identifying existing constraints. This includes:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Business processes – Document steps, roles, inputs, outputs, rules, problems, constraints and impact on the
                solution for in-scope business processes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Data – Document existing logical data entities and their relationships, as well as primary and secondary
                access keys, database physical locations and constraints and impact on the solution for in-scope business
                processes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Organization – Document the organizational chart and constraints and impact of the solution for in-scope
                organizations
            </li>
            <li>
                Technology – Diagram current systems, interfaces and technical infrastructure and document purpose,
                technology, constraints and impact of each on the solution for in-scope business processes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Outline the solution requirements – Scope the major functional (Use Case Model), usability and non-functional
        requirements of the solution to define the "breadth" of the requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Outline the application model – Create a quick, high-level draft of the application model that will address the
        solution requirements and provide a solid indication of the size and complexity of the application.
    </li>
    <li>
        Outline the architectural model – Create a quick, high-level draft of the architectural foundation that the
        application resides on to indicate the size and complexity of the required infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assess business impact - Gauge the level of organizational change likely with the new solution, the organization's
        ability to cope with the change, the customer’s understanding of affected business processes, and the solution’s
        contribution to business goals. The “to be” business process model helps identify report requirements, use cases
        and end-user support requirements, among other advantages.
    </li>
    <li>
        Outline the solution strategy – Specify how to construct the solution and achieve business goals
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirm the solution requirements – provide details and approvals, as required
    </li>
</ul>
