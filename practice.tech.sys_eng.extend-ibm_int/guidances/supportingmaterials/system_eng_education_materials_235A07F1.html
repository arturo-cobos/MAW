                                    The solutioning of complex bids requires bid managers and contributing SMEs to bring
                                    many different things together in a short time period. If this effort is not managed in
                                    a structured and methodical way, we reduce our win chances and create downstream
                                    challenges for implementation teams.

                                <p>
                                    If the Complex Bid Manager understands the interactions of all elements of the bid and
                                    how and where to delegate to subject matter experts, IBM can have better bids, leading
                                    to increased win rates. Better bids also allow fewer gaps or "bugs" going into project
                                    launch - bugs which cost exponentially more to resolve than if found in the sales and
                                    solutioning phases.

                                    This 3-part self paced course prepares senior practitioners to work on complex bids
                                    effectively. It provides a big picture view of the methods and processes that need to
                                    be applied; it introduces simplified solutioning models based on Team Solution Design;
                                    and it provides a granular view of the solutioning process itself and how key work
                                    products evolve across the bid lifecycle. The course describes how to use "solution
                                    thinking" to help partition and specify complex solutions while minimizing gaps and
                                    ensuring that the whole IBM solution is viable, not just the technical elements.

                                    The SE&A Ed Hub is an intensive year long training commitment implemented as a
                                    graduate-level certificate education program for IBM employees developed by Stevens
                                    Institute of Technology (Stevens) and IBM.

                                    The goal of this initiative is to equip our best technical talent (you!) with the
                                    education and skills needed to create solutions for our complex Systems Integration
                                    (SI) projects. The SE&A Ed Hub Program accelerates the learning opportunity for the
                                    next generation of technical leaders by establishing a sequence of week long courses
                                    that combine key courses required for both IT Architect Professional Certification as
                                    well as execution of Complex System Integration (CSI) projects into a coordinated
                                    intensive training curriculum.

                                    Long term - our goal is to increase the quality and quantity of IT Architects
                                    practicing the Systems Engineering and Architecture discipline by providing education
                                    and training required for project execution and needed as prerequisites to gaining the
                                    experiential skills needed for certification as an IT Architect. By coordinating this
                                    key training with the opportunity to receive graduate credit that can lead to an
                                    advanced academic degree, the SE&A Hub Program also is a unique opportunity to
                                    further the students professional and career development in our technical community.
