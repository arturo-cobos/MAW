<p>
    In the SE Capability Pattern, a number of work products are developed before it is time to review the Production
    Baseline, as shown below.

    The performance engineering team has a vested interest in ensuring that performance testing has confirmed the ability
    of the system to meet its performance requirements, and that there are no performance- or capacity-related obstacles to
    the system’s deployment in the production environment. Deliverables which are deemed deficient from a performance and
    capacity standpoint may lead to the entry of a defect, which is then taken into account during the PRR Scorecard
    process.
</p>
<p>
    The PE team should also be working with operations and performance/capacity management personnel to ensure that system
    performance and capacity can be managed successfully, and that performance-related service level attainment can be
    measured and reported on an ongoing basis.

    <p>
        <strong>Organizing the PE Effort during the Production Baseline Phase</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        During this stage of the project, the PE team is typically concerned with activities such as the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Test confirmation of solution’s ability to meet performance requirements</b> – The performance test results
            will generally give the most reliable indication, short of live production, of whether the solution is going to
            be able to meet performance requirements.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Validation of PE findings</b> – The results of the performance test will provide valuable feedback to the PE
            team of the accuracy and effectiveness of their estimating, modeling and performance risk management efforts to
            date.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Deployment recommendation</b> – Once the planned testing is complete, the PE team should have a relatively
            complete picture of how the solution can be expected to perform. At this point, the PE team may be called upon
            directly or indirectly to contribute to a recommendation of whether or not the solution should be
            deployed.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Turnover to delivery / operations</b> – Since the delivery / operations team will be assuming responsibility
            for the developed solution, the PE team and others should participate in turning over information that will be
            needed to deploy and manage the solution in the production environment.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Accepted monitoring approach</b> – During test, the performance monitoring approach should be rehearsed to
            make sure that it will adequately support production.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Confirmed capacity sizing</b> – Performance test results should serve to validate capacity sizing
            information developed earlier.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Accepted SLAs</b> – The delivery / operations team will be finalizing and instituting the Service Level
            Agreement(s) for the system defined earlier, using findings from test and from initial production experience to
            confirm that the SLAs can be supported.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Calibration and validation of earlier models</b> – Results from performance testing can be used to validate the
        findings of earlier modeling, and make future modeling more accurate by adjusting the model so that its results
        align more closely with the results of performance testing.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">
    <strong>Risk and Performance Management Focus during the Production Baseline Phase</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    The results of performance testing will serve to validate the findings of performance engineering, and more importantly
    it will give a clearer, more complete picture of performance risk associated with the system. The PE team must now
    contribute to the process of deciding whether or not the tested system can be deployed as planned. Ultimately the
    decision of whether or not the system will be deployed is made by management, but the PE team and the other technical
    stakeholders will be responsible for advising management of any risks associated with deployment which need to be
    considered, and making a recommendation of what should be done. For SE&A-managed projects, the Production Readiness
    Review (PRR) will provide the PE team their primary opportunity to contribute to the deployment decision.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <strong>Preparing for Production during the Production Baseline Phase</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The primary purpose of the production baseline phase is to prepare to turn the solution over to the delivery /
    operations team for deployment. Up to now, the PE team may already have been working with the delivery / operations
    team on matters such as monitoring, capacity sizing and SLAs, which should now be close to a finalized state. The PE
    team can continue to assist the delivery / operations team by:
</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        <div>
            Participating in peer reviews of performance- and capacity-related deployment work products prior to the
            PRR,&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Ensuring that lessons learned from earlier phases (such as performance defects encountered and recommendations
            for tuning and other improvements) are communicated to the delivery / operations team,&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Seeing that the necessary performance and capacity management tools and procedures are in place to manage the
            production system.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    <strong>Estimating Performance of the Production Solution</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Even after performance results are available from the test and production environments, performance estimation and
    modeling can still play a very important role in the future of the system. As previously discussed, the results of
    testing and production can be used to calibrate earlier performance models, and then the improved models can be reused
    to make performance and capacity projections for the future, even after deployment. Once developed, performance models
    can continue to serve as valuable assets for future performance and capacity management if they are well maintained and
    leveraged.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <strong>Interacting with Test Team during the Production Baseline Phase</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    The performance test may include multiple test scenarios and approaches, depending on what types of applications are
    being tested, which performance requirements are covered and what areas of performance risk are being examined. For a
    complex solution with many components, the combination of component-level and end-to-end performance testing may take
    weeks or even months to complete, between populating databases, executing test scenarios, analyzing test results,
    getting problems resolved as they are encountered, implementing tuning changes and other performance improvements, and
    reporting on the results of the test. The performance test will require the use of a variety of skills, including test
    environment management, performance test scripting and execution, platform-specific analysis and tuning,
    application-level analysis and project management.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    The PE team can assist in this effort by alerting the performance test teams to key performance risk areas in advance,
    by reviewing the test plans and cases, and by assisting with the performance problem determination and performance
    results analysis. It is helpful if the PE team and the performance test team uses a process such as the one shown below
    to select a measurement and analysis approach that supports the performance reporting needs for the task at hand.
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Depending on how responsibilities are divided, the PE team and the performance test team may choose either to
    consolidate their respective teams’ findings or create separate reports. However this is done, the goal should be to
    provide the customer not only with the results of the PE and testing efforts, but with analysis, findings and
    recommendations which can be understood and used to make business decisions.
