        <strong>Review Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The systems engineer (SE) leads the Critical Design Review, thus he/she must work with other team members to
        prepare the CDR package. Copy the CDR template and update it as described below. The template has been used for
        other CDRs, but it may be tailored as necessary for your and your customer's needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CDR should be a REVIEW of the system design and not a working session to define the design. The systems
        engineer should define have defined the baseline in the System Requirements Review (SRR) and the Preliminary
        Requirements Review (PDR). The SRR defines the system baseline and the PDR (if held) defines the component
        baseline. If the PDR is not held, then the component baseline should have been reviewed as part of the SRR.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CDR is a review of the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Component designs - to verify that the designs meet the component requirements
        </li>
        <li>
            Component and e2e test plans - to verify that the test plans are sufficient to test the requirements
        </li>
        <li>
            Production infrastructure capacities - to verify that the production infrastructure will support the
            requirements
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Review Template Usage</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The CDR template:
    </p>
    <p>
        Add a review cover sheet - provide a review date & time, SE contact name, and review/project name
    </p>
    <p>
        Page 1 - delete this page
    </p>
    <p>
        Page 2 - delete this page
    </p>
    <p>
        Page 3 & 4 - tailor as needed
    </p>
    <p>
        Pages 5 through 6 - describes the review criteria. This is the material that you should create when preparing for
        the review.
    </p>
    <p>
        Page 7 - provides review scoring information
    </p>
    <p>
        Page 8 -provides a sample agenda that you can use
    </p>
    <p>
        Page 9 - update the chart such that you get a signoff for each system requirement. The signoff persons should be 1)
        customer(s) & 2) IBM Global Services (IGS) representative â€“ the SPM or whoever is best for your project. But
        there needs to be at least one person from the customer organization and one person from IGS, such that a common
        understanding of the system requirements is reached. The presenter is usually someone on the Systems Engineering
        team. There should not be any issues before the review. This page can be used to document any issues during the
        review that would prevent signoff.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Steps for Conducting the Review</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Systems Engineer leads the CDR by following his CDR agenda. The goal of the CDR is to verify that the component
        designs meet the component requirements, to verify the component and e2e test plans, and to verify the necessary
        infrastructure needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Experience from past reviews has shown that the following process is best for the CDR:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Review all system and component requirement changes since the requirements baselines were defined. Or, if
            possible, provide a list of all requirements, showing traceability, to define the review requirements baseline.
            Review any Business Process changes since it was baselined.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            For each system requirement, review all component requirements and <b>designs</b> that are needed to satisfy
            the system requirement (which shows traceability to the system requirement). Gain approval that the sum of the
            component designs fully satisfies the system requirement.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Review the Service Delivery Center (SDC) material<br />
            Production infrastructure architecture<br />
            Monitoring, Measurement, Management (M3) should have probe architectures documented and probe design scenarios
            documented if any business requirements include "real time" transaction availability and transaction timing
            reporting requirements.<br />
            Any systems monitoring processes over and above the standard offering (i.e., World Wide Commend Center,
            Centralized monitoring and support, application monitoring, business volumes measurement and forecasting, etc.)
            should be documented here.<br />
            Production capacity projections and resources&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            For each of the test types to be performed (Systems Integration Testing, Performance / Stress Testing, User
            Acceptance Testing, Pre-Production Testing, etc), review 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Test scope and requirements
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test environment&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test Data&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test Ground rules
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Review any Data Load for the Tests or for the Production System.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Note defects, issues, risks, and dependencies for all sections as you review the sections&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Gain signoffs for each section, as you review the section&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Review the signoff sheet, the defects, the risks, the issues, and the action items so that everyone agrees with
            the review results.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Update the scorecard at the back of the review template to score the effectiveness of the review.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The CDR should be aligned with the SDC Kickoff meeting, since the SDC representative will prepare much of the same
        materials for the two meetings.
