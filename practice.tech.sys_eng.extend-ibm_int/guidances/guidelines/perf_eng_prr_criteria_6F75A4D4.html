    1 Description
</h3>
<p>
    In an Enterprise SE&A project, the Test Baseline encompasses the release contents, test plans and implementation
    for the system described in the preceding baselines.
</p>
<p>
    This technique paper contains the checklists which the PE team uses during the PRR to ensure that the PE goals and
    objectives have been adhered to during the Test Readiness Phase, It is important that the that performance testing has
    confirmed the ability of the system to meet its performance requirements, and that there are no performance- or
    capacity-related obstacles to the systemâ€™s deployment in the production environment. Deliverables, which are deemed
    deficient from a performance and capacity standpoint, may lead to the entry of a defect, which is then taken into
    account during the PRR Scorecard process.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Usage Context
</h3>
<p>
    This technique paper should be used as guidance while conducting a Production Readiness Review in an enterprise
    SE&A project.
</p>
<h3>
    3 Content
</h3>
<p>
    The following PE specific items should be verified during PRR:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PRR Preparation</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        PE work products / deliverables from earlier phases are revisited based on any new information from
        development&nbsp; 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Performance estimates&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Performance models&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Resulting performance reports (SLCA, Operational Model updates, sizing)&nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Key performance risks areas in developed solution were evaluated using selected estimation / modeling
        techniques&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Results of estimation forwarded to appropriate areas (e.g. development, test team, stakeholders, etc.)&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Component baseline materials reviewed by PE team, especially&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Test results&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment / production management plans
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>PRR Performance Questions</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Do the performance test results indicate that the solution will meet the performance requirements, SLRs within the
        constraints of the capacity plan?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Is there (or are there plans to develop) a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the deployed solution?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the tuning recommendations from test been communicated to the deployment team and planned for
        implementation?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Have all tests been completed and all performance requirements been met within acceptable tolerances?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Is there documented evidence of the performance acceptance criteria having been met? If not, will the stakeholder
        sign off on any exceptions to allow deployment to continue?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Did the performance test team rehearse the live monitoring and performance/capacity management tools and processes
        that will be used by the production support team? If so, have the results of this rehearsal been communicated to
        production support, or were they involved in the rehearsal process?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Has the production support implemented the live monitoring and reporting tools and processes that will be needed to
        support the deployed solution with respect to performance and capacity?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Has the performance risk been reassessed since the TRR and are those risks being adequately addressed?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Are there plans that will allow for a backout staged implementation or extra capacity should unforeseen critical
        performance or capacity issues occur?&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the performance-centric items satisfy the applicable TRR scorecard criteria, i.e.&nbsp; 
        <ul>
