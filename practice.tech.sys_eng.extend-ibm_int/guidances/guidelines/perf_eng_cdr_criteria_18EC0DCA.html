    1 Description
</h3>
<p>
    In an Enterprise SE&A project, the Design Baseline contains the component design for the system described in the
    Component Baseline.
</p>
<p>
    This technique paper contains the checklists which the PE team uses during the CDR to ensure that the PE goals and
    objectives have been adhered to during the Design Baseline Phase, It is important that the performance and capacity
    aspects of the component design are well-conceived and capable of meeting requirements. This proves helpful to the
    later SE&A baselines as the components are implemented, tested and deployed, which in turn enhances the likelihood
    that the overall project will satisfy the customerâ€™s requirements. Deliverables which are deemed deficient from a
    performance and capacity standpoint may lead to the entry of a defect, which is then taken into account during the CDR
    Scorecard process.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Usage Context
</h3>
<p>
    This technique paper should be used as guidance while conducting a Critical Design Review in an enterprise SE&A
    project.
</p>

    3 Content
</h3>
<p>
    The following PE specific items should be verified during CDR:

        <strong>CDR Performance Questions</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Are both system and component technical volumetrics being maintained?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Have business volumetrics changed? Will they change our technical volumetrics, sizing, ability to meet SLRs or
            other performance-critical assumptions?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Has the technology research been completed and incorporated into the estimation/modeling activities?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            What results are available for the system and component performance estimation and modeling activities done to
            date?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Has the capacity plan been updated to take into account the system and component estimation/modeling done so
            far?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Do the component designs reflect adequate attention to performance considerations?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Do the component developers have the tools and techniques they need to address module performance during code
            and unit test?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            How does the development team plan to track progress against their performance goals?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Has a performance test plan been defined?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Will the performance test environment be ready and available by the time performance testing is scheduled to
            start?
