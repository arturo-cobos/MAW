    1 Description
</h3>
<p>
    In an Enterprise SE&A project, the Component Baseline contains the component requirements[see footnote1]&nbsp;for
    the system described in the System Baseline.
</p>
<p>
    This technique paper contains the checklists which the PE team uses during the PDR to ensure that the PE goals and
    objectives have been adhered to during the Component Baseline Phase, It is important that the performance and capacity
    aspects of the system design are well-conceived and capable of meeting requirements. This proves helpful to the later
    SE&A baselines as the components are designed, implemented, tested and deployed, which in turn enhances the
    likelihood that the overall project will satisfy the customer’s requirements. Deliverables, which are deemed deficient
    from a performance and capacity standpoint, may lead to the entry of a defect, which is then taken into account during
    the PDR Scorecard process.

    2 Usage Context

<p>
    This technique paper should be used as guidance while conducting a Preliminary Design Review in an enterprise SE&A
    project.

    [1] From an architecture perspective, the design of a higher level of the system will create a requirement against the
    next lower level component of the system. This means that the “Preliminary Design” of the overall system will include
    the requirements against each of that system’s components.
