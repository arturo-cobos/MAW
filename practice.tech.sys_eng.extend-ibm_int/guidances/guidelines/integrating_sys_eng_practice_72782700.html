    <div>
        The Systems Engineering Practice provides a proven, disciplined, tailorable, life-cycle process to develop and
        manage the technical solution for a project. The&nbsp;practice can be used to enhance an UMF Delivery Process to
        provide a set of <i>technical</i> baselines that will enable the project team to effectively define and control the
        project scope. The figure below depicts a high-level overview of the Systems Engineering process. It shows how the
        process flows from the customer requirements or expectations to product development, and then how the developed
        product is verified and validated to produce a deployed set of functionality or capabilities.
    </div>
    <div>
        <img style="WIDTH: 721px; HEIGHT: 594px" alt="" src="./../../../practice.tech.sys_eng.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/integrating_the_systems_eng_cap_pattern_img1.JPG"         width="600" height="542" />
    </div>
    <div>
        The practitioner should integrate this model with an engagement model when a project is large, complex, or has need
        for a strong technical baseline. The Systems Engineering practice supports the SEI CMMI process and provides a
        strong technical baseline to reduce project risk and thus increase the probability of project success.
    </div>
    <div>
        The Systems Engineering&nbsp;practice provides a set of technical baselines. Each baseline is built upon the
        previous one and provides further refinement to the previous baseline. The technical baselines start at the
        beginning of a project with the customer baseline and end at project completion with the production baseline.
        Throughout the project, the Systems Engineer must control changes to the technical baselines. The technical
        baselines include the requirements documentation and the design/architecture documentation. The change management
        process defined by the Project Manager (PM) for the project must be followed for all changes to the technical
        baselines.
    </div>
    <div>
        The capability pattern and the technical baselines can be combined or tailored to fit the project needs. For more
        information, see the section below on “Tailoring the practice”.
    </div>
    <div>
        As with all practices, there are external inputs (work products) to the practice that must be provided from the
        base delivery process and there are work products and deliverables that are created by the capability pattern that
        will be used as inputs to the base engagement model. When integrating the Systems Engineering practice with a
        delivery process, it is vital to make sure that the inputs and outputs between the practice and the delivery
        process are in synch. While it is optimal if the input/output work products and deliverables exactly match, this is
        not essential. It is essential that the necessary information within the input work product is created by the
        output work product; it is not essential that the exact work product is provided as input. Thus, when there is a
        ‘mismatch’ of input / output work products between the practice and the delivery process, the practitioner must
        determine whether the information needed as input (by the practice or the delivery process) is actually provided by
        another work project that is output (by either the delivery process or the&nbsp;practice). For example, the Systems
        Engineering&nbsp;practice has APP 130 Use Case Model as an input from the customer for the definition of the
        business functional requirements. The customer may provide the business functional requirements in an alternate
        form. But in either case, business functional requirements are needed as an input to the&nbsp;practice.

        <strong>Integrating the practice with Delivery Process</strong>
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        The Systems Engineering practice focuses on the six technical baselines that are created. The six baselines are:
    </div>
    <ul dir="ltr">
        <li>
            <div>
                Customer Baseline&nbsp;
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                System Baseline&nbsp;
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Component Baseline&nbsp;
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Design Baseline&nbsp;
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Test Baseline&nbsp;
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Production Baseline
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div dir="ltr">
        When integrating the Systems Engineering practice with delivery processes, the first step is to determine which
        baselines are applicable to the project. Some baselines may be not needed; for example, the Test Baseline may not
        be applicable if the project does not include a system, integration, performance, or acceptance test that is
        separate from the component test. An example of such a project could be a minor functional upgrade to a single
        application. Other baselines may be combined due to schedule issues and/or lack of system complexity. In all cases,
        it is important to verify that the necessary baseline information is captured in some form.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        These baselines are shown in the figure below. Baseline details and tailoring guidelines are also provided.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        <img style="WIDTH: 732px; HEIGHT: 510px" alt="" src="./../../../practice.tech.sys_eng.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/integrating_the_systems_eng_cap_pattern_img2.JPG"         width="600" height="482" />
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        Of the six baselines, three of them are created by the Systems Engineering team or the customer to provide the
        technical solution details to the development, test and Service Management teams. These baselines provide the
        business, system, and component requirements for the project.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        These baselines are 1) the Customer Baseline, 2) the System Baseline, and 3) the Component Baseline. As shown in
        the figure below, these baselines provide the development, test, and service management teams with the requirements
        to enable the teams to effectively build and test the system. Also, the project’s technical baseline has been
        defined such that the project manager can effectively manage the project.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        <img style="WIDTH: 735px; HEIGHT: 611px" alt="" src="./../../../practice.tech.sys_eng.extend-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/resources/integrating_the_systems_eng_cap_pattern_img3.JPG"         width="600" height="562" />
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        The other three baselines, the Design Baseline, the Test Baseline, and the Production Baseline, are created by the
        development organizations, the test organizations, and project manager. These baselines describe how these
        organizations will implement (or have implemented) the requirements that were created by the first three baselines.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        <b>External Inputs/Outputs by baseline</b> – the following diagrams show the expected external inputs and outputs
        for each of the baselines. These are WPDs and DCDs that are received from or provided to organizations OUTSIDE of
        the Systems Engineering capability pattern. Some of the WPDs and DCDs are listed in multiple baselines. As
        described earlier, other WPDs or DCDs may be substituted for the ones listed below as long as the necessary
        information is provided.

        <b>Tailoring the practice</b><br />
        <a>Tailoring involves determining the particular needs of each work effort and ensuring that the activities are
        performed at the level necessary to ensure quality work is performed, while meeting the needs of the particular
        work effort. The size and complexity of the project, along with other factors considered for each project and each
        customer help to determine the appropriate tailoring when creating the project's defined software process. The
        baselines may be tailored when processes, documents, and reviews are held external to the capability pattern that
        replaces the baseline created within the capability pattern</a>
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        <b>Note</b>: When combining reviews/baselines or tailoring a baseline out of the capability pattern, ensure that
        all components of all reviews are incorporated into the reviews that are held for the project. Standard review
        items may only be excluded if not applicable to the project; they should <b>not</b> be excluded based on a
        particular standalone review not being held.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        The capability pattern may be tailored in several ways:
    </div>
    <ol dir="ltr">
        <li>
            <div>
                Tailor individual WPDs or DCDs to be produced
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Tailor individual activities or tasks to be performed
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                Tailor baselines defined
            </div>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div dir="ltr">
        When tailoring individual WPDs or DCD to be produced by the capability pattern, the practitioner must verify that
        either the WPD/DCD is not needed by the project or that the relevant WPD/DCD information is being provided by
        another WPD/DCD within the capability pattern or within the overall engagement model.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        When tailoring individual activities of tasks to be performed by the capability pattern, the practitioner must
        verify that the activities/tasks and the WPDs/DCDs created by the tailored activities/tasks are not needed by the
        project or that the activities/tasks and the WPDs/DCDs created by the tailored activities/tasks are replaced by
        other activities/tasks/WPDs/DCDs. Since WPDs/DCDs created by one activity/task are used in subsequent
        activities/tasks, the practitioner must verify that the necessary information is created within some project task.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        When tailoring the technical baselines of the capability pattern, the practitioner must verify that the outputs of
        the baselines are created by some other project activities. The output of one baseline is used as inputs to the
        subsequent baselines. This provides the traceability from customer needs through system design, system test,
        acceptance test, and the delivered system.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        The following examples show tailoring that can be performed to the capability pattern and reasons for the
        tailoring. There may be other tailoring reasons for specific projects.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        <b>Combining the BRR and the SRR</b>
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        If the Business Requirements Review (BRR) is held, then the customer business requirements are reviewed at the BRR,
        and any changes to the requirements baseline since the BRR will be reviewed at the System Requirements Review
        (SRR).
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        If the Business Requirements Review (BRR) is <b>not</b> held, the customer business requirements are reviewed and
        approved as part of the System Requirements Review (SRR). The customer business requirements are listed and traced
        to the system requirements in the SRR. The SRR template provides guidance on how the gathered requirements are
        defined and reviewed.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        Customer business requirements and system requirements are typically two different sets of requirements, but may be
        one set of requirements if the customer provides system-level requirements or if the project is small or not
        complex.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        <b>Combining the PDR with the SRR and/or the CDR</b>
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        The PDR may be excluded and its material covered within the project’s SRR and CDR. When the PDR is excluded, the
        project’s requirements are completely defined in the SRR and the design is completely defined in the CDR. Reasons
        for conducting the reviews this way include:
    </div>
    <ol dir="ltr">
        <li>
            <div>
                No separate component requirements baseline is necessary because the project is not complex, the system
                requirements are equal to the component requirements and no further decomposition is needed (for example,
                the system requirements are all allocated to a single component, application or module, etc.).
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                The customer provides requirements at the component level. In this case, the component requirements are
                already defined when they are received from the customer. Validation of these customer requirements is done
                and is already at the component level.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                The project is small and is not complex.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div dir="ltr">
        There may be other reasons to combine these reviews for a specific project.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        System and component requirements may be one set of requirements if the project encompasses only one component or
        application, and the project team decides not to allocate requirements to a lower level than the application. In
        this case, the system requirements are all allocated to a single component, and the system requirements are equal
        to the component requirements.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        Depending on the project size, scope, and team structure, the system requirements document may be updated with
        component requirements or a separate component requirement document may be created. If the requirements are
        combined in a single document, then a ‘Consolidated Requirements Document’ is created that contains all
        requirements rather than having a separate System Requirements Specification and separate Component Requirements
        Specification(s). If a ‘Consolidated Requirements Document’ is created, then the project team should consider
        adding the business requirements to the document in order to consolidate all levels of requirements into a single
        document.
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        <b>Combining the TRR and the PRR</b>
    </div>
    <div dir="ltr">
        If there is not a separate Systems Integration Test (e.g., in small projects all testing may be performed by the
        development teams), then the TRR may be skipped and the relevant TRR information is reviewed at the PRR. For
        example, the PRR would review the development test results rather than the Systems Integration Test results.
