<p>
    Good requirements provide the project foundation to enable the project to meet its cost, schedule, and technical
    objectives.
</p>Depending on the scope or complexity of the project, requirements may be developed at several levels. Examples of
requirement levels are: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Business, System, and Component (as defined in the Systems Engineering Capability Pattern) or
    </li>
    <li>
        Customer, Product, and Product-Component (as defined by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability
        Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
    </li>
</ul>For a specific project, there may be many levels of requirements (including several levels of the component or
product-component requirements that are defined above) or there may be as few as one level of requirements (project
requirements for a small, simple project). 
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

                &nbsp;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>Each level of requirements should contain the following categories of requirements. Some projects may not have any
requirements within a certain category, but the project team should verify whether there are any requirements to be met
within each category. The requirements categories, as defined within Global Services Method, are: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Functional requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Non-functional requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Interface requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Usability requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Other requirements
    </li>
</ul>Also, requirements may be defined in many formats. Requirements may be defined within a Use Case Model, within a
picture, as a ‘shall’ statement, or using free-form text.

<h4>
    Requirements must be baselined and changes to the baselines must be controlled
</h4>
<p>
    As defined in the Systems Engineering Capability Pattern, technical baselines are created for each level of
    requirements and architecture documents (customer business, system and component, as appropriate). The baselines are
    then placed under configuration control, as each baseline is approved in the appropriate review.
</p>
<p>
    The System Engineering Capability Pattern creates a set of six technical baselines. These baselines can be tailored or
    combined based on the needs of the project. Each baseline contains a set of activities, tasks, and work products to
    create a set of deliverables. The project requirements are baselined in the first three technical baselines. These
    baselines are outlined below. For more information on the technical baselines and tailoring of the technical baselines,
    see the Systems Engineering Capability Pattern.
</p>
<p>
    The technical baselines provided by the capability pattern which baseline the requirements are:

    The baselined documents, which have been formally reviewed and agreed upon, can now be changed only through formal
    change control procedures. The change control process will be defined by each project team.
</p>
<p>
    Baselined requirements provide control and stability when interacting with the customer and serve as the basis for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Further refinement of the project solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Design and delivery work products and activities
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing&nbsp; work products and activities<br />
        Appropriate stakeholders must help develop and must approve the requirements<br />
        The appropriate stakeholders should aid in the development of the project requirements. The stakeholders may
        include:
    </li>
    <li>
        Client
    </li>
    <li>
        Customer
    </li>
    <li>
        User
    </li>
    <li>
        Business owner
    </li>
    <li>
        Executive sponsor
    </li>
    <li>
        Project team 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Systems Engineer
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Architect
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;Test team members
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For optimal requirements understanding and agreement, it is usually best to have both the requirements ‘owner’ and
    ‘receiver’ be part of the requirements development process. For example, business requirements may usual owned by the
    customer, client, user, or business team and received by the project team. In this case, both teams should be part of
    the requirements development process. In a similar fashion, component requirements are usually owned by a Systems
    Engineering and Architecture team and provided to the development teams, and thus it is best if both teams are part of
    the development process.
</p>
<p>
    Joint Application Development (JAD) Sessions or Joint Application Requirements (JAR) sessions can be used to facilitate
    the ability / need for the appropriate stakeholders (the requirements owning team and the requirements receiving team)
    to develop the project requirements. For more information on these sessions, see the ‘Conducting Joint Application
    Development (JAD) Sessions’ technique paper.&nbsp;

    The ‘Process Redesign Workshop’ technique paper also provides information on developing project solutions.

    TeamFocus is an environment using meeting technology to quickly clarify problems, explore opportunities, identify
    solutions, and develop concrete plans.

    Requirements are approved / baselined as defined above in the baseline reviews (BRR, SRR, and PDR). Information on the
    attendees and the approvers for each review is defined in the following documents:

<h4>
    Requirements must be prioritized
</h4>
<p>
    <em><strong>Why Prioritize Requirements?</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
    To ensure that the highest value requirements are satisfied first, it is important to prioritize requirements as a
    first step towards selecting which are included in upcoming projects. Prioritizing requirements additionally provides
    developers a mechanism for prioritizing their work to ensure that high priority work is completed, even when some scope
    must be sacrificed to meet delivery dates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Benefits of prioritizing requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        When performed with the customer, improves communication between customer and supplier, and facilitates separating
        essential from desirable, needs from wants, in a way not possible from only one side’s perspective.
    </li>
    <li>
        May enable early delivery of functionality, translating into improved value to the customer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilitates tradeoffs during Analysis and Design activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilitates managing requests for new requirements as well as change requests.
    </li>
    <li>
        Facilitates delivery of a useful product in spite of schedule and resource limitations. Lower priority requirements
        can be deferred to later increments/releases.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Priorities can be used to guide the work effort (e.g. ensuring high priority work is completed first), avoiding
        bailing important work at the end of a project to enable delivery of critical components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Helps resolve requirement conflicts. Tradeoffs can be considered towards achieving the most customer-pleasing
        solution. For example, in the absence of requirements priorities, developers tend to resolve trade-offs in terms of
        ease of development and maintainability.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <em><strong>When to prioritize requirements?</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;Prioritization of requirements is performed throughout a project.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1) Pre-Project</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The stakeholders will prioritize requirements to verify that the correct requirements are selected for the project.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever there is a backlog of requirements, prioritizing them assists selecting high priority requirements for
    upcoming projects. In order to select which requirements should be included in upcoming projects/releases, it is
    recommended that the requirements (including functional and nonfunctional) first be prioritized using a predefined
    scorecard.
</p>
<p>
    Scoring schemes can be relatively simple and still provide a good estimation of the requirement’s value (e.g. score
    range of 0-100, five questions weighted for importance, with range of 0-5 points depending on the answer). Each
    requirement should have the Scorecard questions answered to enable prioritization. Simpler schemes avoid user
    frustration and excess overhead. It is also appropriate to record the rationale for Scorecard responses (e.g. what is
    the baseline and measurement for expected productivity gain).
</p>
<p>
    Requirements that are near the top of the Scorecard list (e.g. those that are likely candidates for upcoming projects)
    qualify for further investigation. The&nbsp; investigation, typically done as part of developing the business case,
    should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Validation of scorecard responses and further enhancement of the value statement (e.g. a review with Finance and
        Marketing)
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk assessment (High Level)
    </li>
    <li>
        Cost/Sizing (High Level)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that it can be appropriate to include lower priority requirements when forming a project. A requirement may be
    justifiable because it is of reasonable value, and fits logically with the other higher priority work (e.g. it hits the
    same components).
</p>
<p>
    This prioritization feeds into, and does not replace, the business case. The prioritization scorecard helps select
    which requirements will give high value. The business case considers not only value, but also cost and risk.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2) Prioritize Business, System, and Component Requirements as part of creating the project baselines</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Prioritization of detailed requirements within a project is often done using a classification scheme and is done with
    close cooperation from the customer. Prioritization should include all requirements (e.g. functional and
    nonfunctional).
</p>
<p>
    Business, system and component requirements should be prioritized, and the priorities should be reviewed at the BRR,
    SRR, and PDR reviews. By working with the stakeholders in JAD/JAR sessions, the SE&A team can define the priorities
    of these requirements. The priorities will be inherited from the parent requirements and then updated to reflect the
    true value to the stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if 3 system requirements are defined based on a single business requirement (the parent requirement), then
    the initial priority of the 3 system requirements will be the same as the business requirement. If the business
    requirement was prioritized as an 'essential' requirement, then the 3 system requirements will be initially prioritized
    as 'essential' requirements. Through working sessions with the stakeholders, it may be determined that one or more of
    the system requirements are less important than the others. Thus, these requirements may be given a lower priority. The
    same relationship holds true for component requirements and the parent system requirement.
</p>
<p>
    Prioritization of requirements may be necessary at even lower levels than Component Requirements. For example, if a
    component requirement indicates that a report is to be provided with certain fields in the report, it may be useful to
    prioritize the fields in the report (some fields may be more important to the customer than other fields, and
    prioritization of the fields would allow the customer to receive the most important report information in an earlier
    delivery of the functionality).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3) Prioritize requirements changes versus current requirements baselines - reviewed when the changes are
    assessed / approved</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Most Plan Change Requests attempt to add requirements to a project. It is important that&nbsp; requirements included in
    change requests be prioritized against all other outstanding requirements. Organizations and customer relationships may
    affect how value prioritization is implemented for Change Requests.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Prioritization Definitions</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The following definitions (sourced from the IEEE Standards Collection, Std 830-1998) may be used for priority:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Essential - This implies that the system will not be acceptable unless these requirements are provided in an agreed
        manner.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conditional - This implies that these are requirements that would enhance the system, but would not make the system
        unacceptable&nbsp;if they are absent.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optional - This implies a class of functions that may or may not be worthwhile.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Other prioritization definitions include (from highest to lowest priority):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Musts, Shoulds, Coulds
    </li>
    <li>
        Essential, Useful, Desirable
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The definition and meaning of each priority must be agreed to with the customer.
</p>
<h4>
    Appropriate tools must be used to develop and control requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Tools are used to aid in the development and control of requirements. Depending on the project complexity and the
    requirement needs of the project, various tools may be used to develop and control the requirements. The Systems
    Engineering Capability Pattern provides a set of requirement DCDs that can aid in the development of requirements and
    associated documentation.
</p>
<p>
    A partial set of tools that can be used follows:

<h4>
    Requirements must be traceable
</h4>
<p>
    The Requirements Traceability and Verification Matrix demonstrates how each requirement must be tracked through the
    project life cycle. Traceability of requirements must be performed until each requirement is delivered, withdrawn or
    transferred to another project.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements traceability is bidirectional and includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Tracking each requirement to the previous levels of requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Tracking each requirement to design and build documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        Tracking each requirement to test documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        Tracking each requirement to acceptance criteria
    </li>
