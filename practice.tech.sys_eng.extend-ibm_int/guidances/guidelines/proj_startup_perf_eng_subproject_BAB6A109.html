    1 Description
</h3>
<p>
    Just as the MAW is used to tailor the Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) to the needs of a particular project,
    the use of PEMM themes and activities within a given project must also be adapted to project scope and organization
    factors. Additionally, while it is desirable to align PEMM themes and activities with the SE&A baselines, it should
    be noted that many PE activities go beyond the scope of the SE&A team’s direct responsibilities. For these reasons,
    it is helpful to manage the PE effort as a subproject in its own right, to be initiated by means of a PE project
    definition workshop (PE PDW).
</p>
<p>
    Since the capability pattern is fairly comprehensive and since the project at hand may only call for a subset of the
    phases or activities to be performed by the SE&A team, this allows the team to build a work breakdown structure
    (WBS) for the in-scope activities.

    2 Usage Context
</h3>
<p>
    This technique paper should be used as guidance on how to initiate the PE subproject by the use of a project definition
    workshop (PDW).

    <p>
        <strong>The objective of the PE PDW is the formation of an extended Performance Engineering team with an agreed-to
        approach for managing performance risk throughout the life of the project.</strong> This particular meeting is not
        intended to capture performance requirements or to develop a detailed performance engineering plan, since those
        will be developed later. However, an effective PE PDW will provide much of the information that the PE team will
        need to develop a suitable performance engineering strategy.

        The PE PDW is organized as follows:
