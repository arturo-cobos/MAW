    1 Description
</h3>
<p>
    In an Enterprise SE&A project, the Test Baseline encompasses the test plans and supporting documentation for the
    system described in the preceding baselines.
</p>
<p>
    This technique paper contains the checklists which the PE team uses during the TRR to ensure that the PE goals and
    objectives have been adhered to during the Test Readiness Phase, It is important that the performance and capacity
    aspects of the test plan are well-conceived and focused on addressing the key performance requirements and the areas of
    greatest performance risk. Deliverables, which are deemed deficient from a performance and capacity standpoint, may
    lead to the entry of a defect, which is then taken into account during the TRR Scorecard process.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Usage Context
</h3>
<p>
    This technique paper should be used as guidance while conducting a Test Readiness Review in an enterprise SE&A
    project.

            Is the performance test set up so that it can assess the solution against the business and technical
            volumetrics, the SLRs and the capacity plan?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Have business volumetrics changed? If so, does the test plan take into account the latest information?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Has the prior estimation/modeling work identified areas of performance risk that the performance testing will
            address? Will the performance test team be sharing their results so that existing models can be calibrated
            against actual results?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Do the development team findings show any areas of performance risk that the performance test should be
            attentive to?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Is the performance test team prepared to engage the appropriate analysis and tuning skills should they be
            needed during the test?&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Are all performance test deliverables (test strategy, test plan, test cases, test environment) ready to go?
        </li>
        <li>
            Are the development and systems support teams ready to support the test effort and respond to performance
            problems should they be found?&nbsp;

        <li>
            Will the performance test team be rehearsing the live monitoring and performance/capacity management tools and
            processes that will be used by the production support team?&nbsp;

        <li>
