A Data Quality Plan is required in order to attain and maintain the required level of data quality in the system. Building
data quality is typically a result of solid adherence to the definition of data quality criteria from both a business
process and data design perspective. As a result there are preventative data quality best practices that focus on the
development of new data sources and integration processes and there are detective data quality best practices that focus on
identification and remediation of poor data quality.</td>

    The Data Quality Plan provides guidelines to build and maintain data quality processes required to achieve the
    necessary levels of data quality for a target environment.<br />
    <br />
    There may be two levels of the Data Quality Plan – strategic or tactical. The difference between these is in the scope
    and detail of the contents of the work product. A strategic Data Quality Plan would be at some level of the business
    organization, addressing how the organization interacts with it’s customers and suppliers through data interchange
    activities resulting in a given level of data quality within the boundary of the organization, whereas the tactical
    Data Quality Plan would be at the project level showing the interaction of the data stores within the project scope
    with other components outside the project’s boundaries.. These interactions may occur either during application system
    initiation time by way of extract, transform and load (ETL) programs or they may occur throughout the life of the
    system through recurring interface programs. This document could be used with both tactical and strategic data quality
    plan. But, the review was conducted with tactical view.<br />
    <br />
    The document describes different aspects of data quality to be included at various phases of the project in order to
    achieve data quality.<br />
    <br />
    The data quality plan:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Defines the scope of data quality,
    </li>
    <li>
        Defines data quality requirements,
    </li>
    <li>
        Identifies critical data,
    </li>
    <li>
        Assesses quality of existing data,
    </li>
    <li>
        Designs data quality checkpoints and controls,
    </li>
    <li>
        Defines how to resolve issues,
    </li>
    <li>
        Defines how to cleanse the data,
    </li>
    <li>
        Defines how to measure data quality,
    </li>
    <li>
        Defines how to ensure data quality is achieved after applying the recommendations
    </li>
    <li>
        Defines the roles and their responsibilities in data quality plan.
    </li>
</ul>A Data Quality Plan defines the data quality requirements for planning purposes for the proposed phase or project. The
scope would differ from project to project depending on whether data quality is being considered at strategic level or
tactical level and the level of data quality to be achieved.</td>

    A brief description of the various sections required to be in the Data Quality Plan work product is provided below.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Introduction</strong> - This provides an introduction to the Data Quality Plan of the proposed project. It
        describes the purpose and scope of the Data Quality Plan. The scope would depend on whether the Data Quality Plan
        is being looked at the strategic or tactical level. 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Purpose -</strong> This should describe the purpose of having a Data Quality Plan for the specific
                project. This information would assist in determining the feasibility of the intended project by providing
                levels of risk, scope and time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scope of the Data Quality Plan</strong> - This section defines the data quality requirements for
                planning purposes for the proposed project. The scope would differ from project to project depending on the
                level of data quality to be achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would also address post production continuous
                improvement and is based on the data source analysis and business rules developed for a project. The scope
                would depend on whether the data quality plan is being looked at the strategic level or tactical level. The
                below sections explain the scope at the strategic level.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Quality Context</strong> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Quality Objectives and Goals</strong>&nbsp; - The objectives would set the direction for how
                to achieve the data quality goals defined by the project. Objectives would describe the plan to prevent
                data defects from occurring, detect the defects as early as possible in the development/test cycles and
                identify the ways to implement continuous improvement to maintain the data quality once the project moves
                to production.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Quality Approach and Procedure</strong> - Describes the tasks and approach for evaluating the
                data quality of data structures and interface specifications. Although not a common focus area during the
                development lifecycle, this plan also includes the approach to implement continuous improvement after a
                project is put into production.&nbsp; The three dimensions of data quality which need to be considered as
                part of the Data Quality Plan are: 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Data elements
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Technical data quality
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Business process
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong> - This section identifies the individuals and responsibilities required
        to execute the Data Quality Plan, as well as data ownership of the required data. Identify any additional resources
        required to maintain the required data quality, like resources to fix the data issues that are found once the
        project is moved to production or resources required for data cleansing activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Quality Activities</strong> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Identification of Major Data Quality Issues</strong> - This would include the major data quality
                issues identified by assessing and analyzing the existing data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Trusted Source and Interface Specifications</strong> - This section provides a detailed description
                of the trusted sources and interface specifications required for the project as well as the criteria that
                each source must meet before being considered as trusted. This section will establish the validation
                process for trusted sources and provide a top level schedule. 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Interface Specification Analysis -</strong> This subsection describes the steps to be taken
                        to ensure the quality of data through the data movement process. The objective is to make sure that
                        no data is lost or corrupted as it passes from one application data source to another. The
                        validation of all the interface specification material can be considered a data quality function. 
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Review Interface Specifications and Analyze Application Interface Points</strong> -
                                This subsection outlines what is needed to review each interface specification. This
                                process requires that the interface specification has completed the project’s approval
                                cycle. The Data quality issue identified earlier (4.1) need to be addressed by the
                                Interface Specifications.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Review the UI Specifications -</strong> This UI should be reviewed to ensure that
                                all compatible data is being entered into the system.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Review the Batch Interface Specifications</strong>&nbsp; - There could be a number
                                of configuration parameters that might be involved in an interface and have to be set up in
                                order to allow data to flow between systems. These parameters should be checked to ensure
                                they are set to allow the flow of the data required by downstream system.
                            </li>

        Not having a Data Quality Plan may result in not attaining the required level of data quality. This would later
        result in additional efforts like fixing the defects, cleansing data and rework.

    <li>
        Data quality relates to the accuracy with which the data reflects reality. An organization’s actions, if based on a
        ‘flawed reality’ may create costly mistakes. This would negatively impact the overall satisfaction.&nbsp; For
        example, financial systems require a high degree of quality data due to the importance and usage of the data, but a
        marketing system may have the latitude to operate with a lower level of data quality without significantly
        impacting the realization of the granular strategic objectives attributed to its stakeholders. Since the “purpose”
        varies, so does the bar that is used to measure fitness to purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
        Not having a Data Quality Plan may result in not achieving the data quality required by the internal control
        system. Strategic system development control points may be required to make sure data quality is taken care of.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><ul>
    <li>
        A Data Quality Plan may not be required if the impact of bad data is negligible on the system. The level of data
        quality required to effectively support operations will vary by information system or business unit, depending upon
        the information needs to conduct that business unit’s operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Data Quality Plan may not be required if the data is coming from a trusted source where the data quality is
        already in place.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Data Quality Plan may not be required when the size or duration of the project is small (such as a few months
        with a staff of 10 or less).
    </li>
    <li>
        A Data Quality Plan may not be required in the unusual case where the data is self contained and there is no data
        implication.
