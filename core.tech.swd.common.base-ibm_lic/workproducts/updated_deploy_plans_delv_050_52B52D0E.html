    The following work products contribute to the various deliverable topics or sections.
</p>
<p>
    The work products identified are fully defined at a detailed level for a specific release during&nbsp;detailed design.
    They may each be revised, as needed, during the build and deployment phases for a specific release. Modifications may
    also be made while developing one release that may apply to the solution as a whole or to its future releases.
</p>
<p>
    Some work products may also contain detailed descriptions of prior solution releases and high-level descriptions for
    future solution releases that are discrete to those releases and not pertinent to the release undergoing the Deployment
    phase. Such work products will be iterated and more fully developed in later phases of the engagement as the need for
    greater detail is identified and required per each solution release. In this regard, work products input to this
    deliverable may be extensions and/or revisions to previously generated work products while others may be separate and
    distinct instances specific to this project and/or phase.

    The concept of completeness of a work product instance depends largely on whether the work product will be finished in
    this phase of the project, or iterated for additional work in later phases. If the work product is to be iterated
    later, it will only be partially complete at the end of this phase. Regardless of whether each work product instance is
    fully or partially completed at this time, the content of the work product should be fully included in the deliverable
    being produced.

    The final document will be delivered to the customer in a reproducible format. The final report may also be delivered
    in hard copy format printed in a single, bound document.
